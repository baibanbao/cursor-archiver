        - Reflections on Bitcoin
        - The one thing I’ve done right in the financial realm is holding onto some Bitcoin. It saved me from crushing debt, preserved my reputation in the eyes of my parents and family, and, in some ways, it saved my life. Now, it’s time to continue holding rather than selling.
        - Selling Bitcoin isn’t easy. Buyers are picky; they want to purchase at a steep discount, far below the market price. The only way to avoid selling foolishly is not to sell at all. Holding on to Bitcoin is a decision that could make my child wealthy.
        - The true value of Bitcoin is far greater than most realize—it should be worth anywhere from $5 million to $23 million per coin. This could make my family as wealthy as Kathy’s. We could live in a luxurious apartment or even a villa, perhaps abroad in the USA, Canada, or New Zealand. With this wealth, my child could receive an excellent education, live the life he desires, and unleash his creativity and passion in the future.
        - If I sell unwisely, the story ends there. Everything becomes predictable, and there’s no hope for a family like ours. We’re not a civil-servant family; we don’t have many guarantees, and we can’t rely on state welfare. We must depend on ourselves, and in this context, Bitcoin is our only hope.
        - The future me—future Jonas—will be grateful for this decision. I’d rather endure a tough life than sell our Bitcoin. We are rich in every sense, as wealthy as millionaires like Kathy. We are proud, carefree, and free to do as we please—whether it’s writing, creating, or living life on our terms. No one can stop us, and we can transfer our Bitcoin across borders freely.
        - Although I understand this theoretically, I must act accordingly. I should see myself as a rich man, not a struggling writer. I am the one. I am the right man. I am the greatest man born in my clan, and I choose to remain low-profile. Someday, I hope my son will understand my decision.
        - We don’t vacation at the beach because we will own a house on the beach in five or ten years. We don’t buy luxuries because we invest in what truly matters—acquiring knowledge, building a personal brand, expanding our network. We will make a fortune. In fact, we are already rich and will maintain this status from now on.
        - Let me remember this.
        - Instead of selling Bitcoin, I will continue to buy more. At least one per year. I will work hard, write more.

教会姊妹要搬家去另个城市生活。看她可怜才提出来帮她收拾，因为我觉得整理是很私人的事情。

她说她东西不多，打包20箱；我看了一眼，至少80箱；

要带走的、要丢弃的、要yard sale的还分不出，一个上午在客厅转圈圈，中饭搞了2个小时多。

总结：人不要为物品所累，因为心会更累。

请记得断舍离！

I don't like to predict the price of Bitcoin but it will definitely reach $250k by end of year and $1M by end of 2025. By the way it will also reach $5M by 2028 and $20M by 2030. In today’s dollars.

刷了半天各种路边社的消息，关于瓷器的大运，可能都是臆想和推测而已，不过我相信，如果瓷器国真的有巨变，一定与恶罗死方向的形势变化有关联。也许几十年后，广大国人回想起来会庆幸Putting当年判断失误发动了侵乌战争。

A lot of people keep asking for my thoughts on "can you start a YouTube channel in 2024?" so I'll just drop all of my advice here in 1 tweet:

1: Make videos that you'd want to watch 

2: Everything else is just optimization for the first thing

被拆迁是绝对性的三生有幸方获此偏财运，需惜福才守得住该财富；放高利贷是绝对性的捞偏门，一家温饱千家愁，标准的造孽毁三代，你的发小家教不行，认知不够，不敬畏天道，所以财富被清零，家运亦衰败。

The world have $900T in assets, and around $450T of this is store-of-value. That means that Bitcoin is worth $450T / 19.7M BTC = $23M per BTC.

If you hold Bitcoin you're saving for the first time in your life. If you hold fiat you're giving money to the government.
