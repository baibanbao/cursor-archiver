thinking about posting pics of your baby?
bet you didn't know that anyone with the picture can use technology to accurately age the image, predicting what your child will look like.
they can create porn or fake social medias or fake videos with that.

People saw the Taylor Swift AI art story and still post pictures of their children to thousands of unknown followers on the internet. Extremely high psychological risk imo

Deepfake sexual imagery is a horrific, traumatic and unacceptable form of harassment. 

It shouldn't have happened to Bobbie Althoff, it shouldn't have happened to Taylor Swift, it should never happen to anybody.  

We can stop this. We need to stop this.   

Let's ban deepfakes.
