            - 最近印象很深的一个帖子：作者用GPT-4写了一本长达12章、115页的小说《亚特兰蒂斯的回声》。整本书的情节完全由GPT-4自己生成，作者只提供了一般的写作方法（比如要有开头和结尾之类的）。小说正文看起来像模像样的，作者的指令也是相当复杂，整个思考过程也很有意思。

        - Notion的核心，就是赋予每个人构建数字资产的能力
        - 看来我也得花点时间想想，围绕Notion有什么产品机会，思考Checklist:
        - 1. Notion的用户有什么痛点？ 最好这个痛点是Notion出于局限不会去解决的
        - 2.这样的痛点是否有API能解决？
        - 3. 是否已经有产品解决了这个痛点?  用户量如何？
        - 4. 我的团队是否有能力，在可承受的时间和预算内解决这个痛点？
        - 我不是Notion的目标用户，但我逐渐理解了Notion, 用Minecraft的思维来构建，用户可以用block搭建出自己的解决方案。 可以是一个网站，可以是一个相册，可以是一个付费课程 
        - 只能说，这些老外做产品确实跟我们不在一个维度
        - 难怪一个笔记app,人家就能估值百亿美金，咱只能努力做个价值百万美金的产品
        - 不要盲目追热点，容易被韭菜
        - 不要为了AI而AI，AI一定要和核心体验有关才有意义，能大幅提升效率or大幅提升效果，让不可能变成可能。
        - 一个相册app/笔记app也搞AI，这对大公司或有价值，可很多用户只是需要一个拥有良好离线体验的随时能用的工具
        - 对于独立开发者来说，需要寻找属于自己的niche market
        - 系统进入稳态之后，都会勒紧对每个人的枷锁
        - 这也是为啥月入两三万还是紧巴巴，也是美团骑手越来越难
        - 如何对待？3个途径:
        - 1.努力奋斗，等待命运召唤打破阶层;
        - 2.改变赛道或者回老家(如果老家有房)
        - 3.给自己更多时间从物质世界到精神世界，把时间浪费在美好的事情
        - 自由或奴役，既是真实的，也是虚幻的

        - https://zhuanmeidao.blogspot.com/2022/04/5.html
        - 文章关键是"信息差套利思维",举几个例子：
        - 1. 国家:把国内火了的产品搬到国外
        - 2.平台:把IOS火了的产品搬到ANDROID
        - 3.语言: 把某APP本地化到其他小语种
        - 4.技术: 把某Native APP用H5或网站来实现
        - 怎样获得更多的时间:
        - 1) 远离浪费你时间的烂人烂事
        - 2) 花钱节省时间: 比如多花钱住的离公司近一点，比如买VIP不看广告
        - 3) 花钱购买别人的时间：自己专注于核心, 非核心工作外包出去
        - 4) 减少迷糊的时间: 多运动，保持头脑清明
        - 5) 折叠时间:  同时做至少2件事情，比如上班路上听podcast, 跑步机上看美剧
        - 几点建议供参考:
        - 1. Freemium是趋势，订阅才是王道。 单纯的付费版用户量很难起来
        - 2. 做付费型产品，着眼全球市场比国内市场更有前途。
        - 3. 结合AI的工具产品大有可为，很多细分市场的收益大到难以想象。杭州的睿琪软件做植物识别，一天收益几万美金，后面又做了一堆石头识别，昆虫识别等等，收益都不错
        - 疫情隔离让我把app的吉他课程学完了。今天又练5个小时，打游戏都玩不了这么久。 还是因为进入了'心流'。
        - 每个人都应找到能让自己进入心流的事情，身心合一的忘我，把生命发挥到极致。
        - 喜欢'心灵奇旅'里的概念: 忘我之境就在天堂的旁边，"忘我"是人活着所能得到的最美好的体验，让人具有了"神性"
        - 事情的好坏是可以互相转化的，就看我们如何看待。 
        - 比如因为疫情,我有更多的时间来学吉他，用Simply Guitar App学了近30个小时，指弹水平提升不少 
        - 比如以前每天地铁通勤来回2个小时，我自学了韩语俄语西班牙语等小语种。 当然，每个语种都只学了50个小时左右，也算有初步的了解
        - 如何更加幸福的取得成就，我有两个模型: 心流模型和游戏化模型。
        - 1)心流模型: 多做让自己处于心流-忘我的事情
        - 2)游戏化模型: 充分使用各种核心驱动力，常见的有进度感（把事情化整为零并可视化),社交关联（和别人互相督促)。
        - 具体可以GOOGLE“游戏化模型”，这是对人生和工作都有战略意义的工具。
        - 最近我很有感触的一句话：不要靠目标，要靠系统来过自己的生活。 
        - 系统可以理解为有反馈的模型。 举个例子，给自己定了个目标，1个月读书5本。 这样的目标并不能帮助你。你可以用游戏化模型来把你的目标拆解，用建立更微小的目标，把进度可视化，把进度目标分享给社交圈等方式， 完成目标就更容易了
        - 两天时间读完了张一鸣的2300多条微博，感受很深，多向他学习，多看好书，多锻炼身体，多反省复盘，努力提升自己的认知层次。
        - 鹿老师尝试了半天阿拉伯语，还是先搁置了。。。还是先把法语学50小时再说。    英语，日语，韩语，西班牙语，俄语，德语都各自学满了50小时了。  不为了精通，就是"微精通"的概念
        - 重读稻盛和夫的“心”，书的结尾:
        - 无论什么人，能够拥有的都只是当下的这一个瞬间，以怎样的心态活在当下，将决定我们的人生
        - 很喜欢的一句话：想想自己葬礼上主持人怎么评价自己，然后想想自己应该怎么样生活。 
        - 我希望获得的评价是：他是一个连续创业者，他是一个游戏化的布道者和实践者，他是一个写出过热门单曲的音乐人，他是一个会八国语言的语言学家，他是一个去过30多个国家的旅行家。他把自己的时间和天赋发挥到了极致
        - 以上全对，但补充一点，遗憾的是有一段时间他对tyranny缺乏必要的警觉，从而不知不觉成了silent cooperator of the absolute corrupt power。
        - 对我来说，一个外语就是一种解码器（decoder），帮我解锁一种异国文化。 
        - 我还在学其他语言，比如韩语（学了30小时），西班牙语（学了46小时），俄语（12小时）。学语言太有意思了!
        - 珍惜时间，远离抖音。 最近了解的关于抖音一些有意思的讯息
        - 抖音不能让你学到任何东西，因为它只会投其所好推荐你感兴趣的同质化的内容，根本无法提升你的认知。
        - 当然，投其所好是符合人性的。抖音上了推荐系统之后，播放时长和留存直接翻倍。
        - 抖音上无数的亲情的，见义勇为的视频，90%都是摆拍
        - 这么多年，我觉得在指引我人生的几句话：
        - 1. 一定要做有积累的事情，要做有时间复利的事情
        - 2. 按自己的想法度过一生就是成功
        - 3. 什么是成功的捷径？ 就是选一个你喜欢的方向，然后像傻子一样努力就行了
        - 为何视频更有价值
            - 虽然从信息密度思考是这样。但是，音频视频内容可以形成时间的叠加，让人觉得时间更有价值。比如上班路上听podcast，跑步机上看美剧。

存在即合理。任何事物的流行必然有他背后的原因。

这一刻，世界与我无关，我沉浸着去感受用户的心情，去洞察背后的痛点和机会。

这一刻，工作的过程就是奖励，而不是结果

希望大家也能有更多的时间在这个状态里！

            - 赚钱的本事除了父母谁也不会告诉你
                - 别指望别人把自己赚钱的本事告诉你

如果有人说他能帮你致富,除非是你父母,不然可能把你当韭菜

写推对我来说,是消磨时间,磨练大脑的事情. 不图靠这个赚钱,我不缺钱

看我推不能让你迅速致富,但能让你在更多的层面认识这个世界

把我这两年推好好看看,或许有收获.有缘者得之

            - 受欢迎与不受欢迎
                - 【好文分享：分析了ProductHunt上10000个产品，得到了以下结论】

要点概括：
1. 受欢迎的品类：
Web based apps, automation products, email productivity, community focused products and screen recording / screenshotting 
2. 不受欢迎的品类：
Pomodoro, QR Code, Habit Tracking, VPN, Paywall or Notification 
3. 竞争最激烈的领域：
Automation (148 apps)，Chatbots(118 apps)，Design (118 apps)，Video (105 apps)

总体来说，
- 能帮用户节省时间甚至赚钱的就容易受欢迎，而番茄钟之类的则比较简单，难有创新
- 不要畏惧红海，水大鱼才大。 在红海中找到一个垂直的细分市场，更容易拿到结果。 相比于冷门领域而言
- 当然，以上结论都是针对ProductHunter而言，这些人本来就是互联网世界最活跃的"生产者"。
            - 小语种优势
                - 【一个开发者掌握一门小语种，意味着什么】

很多国家的开发者无论从能力，勤奋程度都远远不如中国开发者，

熟悉小语种，意味着你拥有一定的信息差和资源差，更可能捕捉到细分市场的机会

随便举几个例子: 
一个武汉的小团队，法语三消游戏是他们主盈利项目
一个国内小团队，专门做阿拉伯语的小游戏，闷声发财
一个拉美开发者，开发一个西班牙语版的圣经，月赚1万美金
            - 【有意思的小案例】
给大家分享个"一鱼多吃"的经典案例：
国内一个休闲游戏Top团队，早期从Bible App入手，围绕Bible一鱼多吃，打造产品矩阵，Bible coloring, Bible puzzle等。

用户画像是"美国&中老年白人&基督徒"，用户价值超高

5万DAU居然收益就达到1万美金一天
----------------------------
当你在一个领域积累了用户，又洞察到这些用户的痛点时，
 "一鱼多吃"是个好主意: 垂直扎下去，既有流量，又能给出好的交付，做成的概率会高很多
                - 所以，移动互联网进入到这个阶段，Universal的产品机会很少了。 属于小开发者的机会，一定是"垂直"领域。

只有垂直，才能击穿这个产品，真正俘获某一群人的心智

垂直的前提是，你极度了解这群用户，能和他们共情，最好自己就是这类用户。 

当然，不要为了垂直而垂直，垂直必须和核心体验有关，必须能提供让用户无比舒适的差异化体验。

举个例子，就像BIBLE的涂色APP，涂色素材都是和宗教相关的，能给教徒们极大的满足。

所以，做个LGBT的涂色就可以，因为涂色的素材和用户的品味取向有极大关系；而做个LGBT的待办清单或者记账，似乎就关联不大了

所以，很多品类，一旦带着这个视角去审视，可能会发现很多机会。

        - 三防原则，防接触，防起意，防伤害。

1是物理隔离。2是避免引起对方恶意。3是避免自己处于对方能伤害的位置。 

物理隔离简单却又有效。
            - 这个社会，各行各业都面临着巨大的生存压力，戾气无处不在

她应该不知道，有些职业是不能惹的，
比如屠夫(杀人技巧娴熟)，司机(你的命在他手里)，快递(了解你家经济实力而且很了解你家的出行规律)，理发师(你雪白的脖子就在他刀下)，医生(有很多方法杀人于无形)，三陪女(一般都有混黑道的相好)……
好吧，开玩笑的，其实什么人都别惹

害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无

怎么防呢，有三个维度： 

1.防接触： 
能物理隔离就物理隔离。 
    比如，某富翁住在上亿豪宅，快递从来不送到家里，都是放在小区门口快递柜。 
    我平时打车一般不打顺风车和快车而只打专车，因为知道专车对司机的资质和培训要求高很多

2.防起意： 
不要口出恶语。大家都是混口饭吃，人与人多一分理解包容。 

    比如，我从不给商家司机和骑手差评。一个差评会让他们半个月白干。

     有次，一家人半夜从机场打车回家，车开了司机临时加价二十块，老人正要跟他理论，被我拦住了，人家半夜还在拉活不容易，只要把我们平安送到就行，几十块就算给他的小费了

3.防伤害： 
这涉及“防御性”的概念，就是不让自己处于别人有机会伤害你的位置

  古话说，二人莫看井，独坐莫凭栏，就是这个理。 别让别人有机会把你推下深渊

  比如，跟司机吵架同时违反第二第三条，因为司机有很多方式伤害你

  案件中的受害者，也是同时违反了第二第三条，发型不满意就不满意嘛，戴几天帽子就好了。吵了架就赶紧离开这个是非之地嘛，还要待在那里。。

 哎，生死有命，但是，认知也是命运的一部分

            - Sam Altman 对 Al的一些观点
            - •A价值尚未被放大。几年内可以和Google一较高下
            - 。多模态模型，会打开新局面
            - 。Al初创公司的自身价值会是数据飞轮 （更多数据可以训练出更好的模型，吸引更多用户，从而产生更多数据用于训练，形成循环)
            - 。五年后将不再需要Prompt Engineering
            - 。A科学的可能应用：Al成为自我改进的科学家。解决A对齐问题（让Al系统符合人类的价值观），风险在于自己改动代码或者优化算法。
            - •Al迭代的方式应该先沿确定性高的路走，10%的资源进行确定性低的探索工作
            - （让A无所不能），伟大的事物都不是计划出来的，有时重大的突破生于偶然。 •三大技术革命（农业，工业，T）之后，Al是第四个，将产生足够的财富，让每个人拥有他们所需要的东西
            - •万物摩尔定律。增加社会财富的最好方法是降低商品的成本 （另一个方法是获得更多的钱）。芯片，同样价格下每两年会强大一倍。财富是购买力：我们能用我们拥有的资源获得多少。
            - •未来财富的主要来源：
            - •公司，特别是AI公司
            - 。土地，固定供应
            - 。Al取代谁的工作，十年前大部分人认为取代的顺序
            - •蓝领>低技能白领>高技能白领>创造性工作 （也许不会发生） 。现在事实证明，Al最有可能取代的反而是创造性工作
            - 。这种预测说明人类可能不够了解自己，不清楚什么类型的技能最难，最需要调动大脑，或者错误估计了控制身体的难度。
            - 。深层次的东西不会改变，注重人与人之间的互动联系，大脑奖励机制（追求快乐、创造欲、竞争欲），一百年后也不会变
            - 。未来几十年里，重大的哲学问题将再次出现，重要的技能是适应性和韧性，拥抱变化很重要。
            - 。Paul 的一句话：在几乎所有同时代的人看来，牛顿都是在浪费时间。

                - 场景：一位工程师正坐在笔记本前，他刚写下一个函数名，IDE 的人工智能就自动给他写好了函数代码。代码正确又整洁，工程师开始怀疑编程和思考本身的意义，变得十分沮丧。这时，大师从他的身后路过…
                - 大师：有些东西，就像树叶，既然自然界造物主已经为它们设计了一个完美的落地方，我们也不必操心。只要意识到自己只是编写代码的工具，就不会对结果产生怀疴。这就像蝴蝶飞舞，不必担心飞到哪里，只要放手让它随风飞翔。

            - 感觉中国已经自我锁死了，没有言论自由的情况下，AI 不可能提升国民生产效率；独裁政府又无法发展复杂的工业科技，所以芯片也造不出来。机器人的话，又会造成大量低端行业人口失业。
    - 影音案例
        - 神奇的`ffmpeg`
            - ffmpeg 和 regex、sed、awk 之类魔法一样神奇。想给录屏加一个循环背景音，下载了几个软件都不行。让 chatGPT 给我一个 ffmpeg 的命令，没想到一秒就完成视频音频合并了。感觉以后让 chatGPT 作为代理去驾驭这些黑魔法的软件和技术，简直不要太爽。
            - 这段代码的解释
                - 是的，ffmpeg 是一个非常强大的命令行工具，它可以用来处理视频和音频文件。以下是在录屏视频上添加循环背景音乐的 ffmpeg 命令及其参数：
                - `ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -stream_loop -1 -i music.mp3 -shortest -map 0:v -map 1:a -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k output_video.mp4`
                - • -i input_video.mp4：指定输入的视频文件名。
                - • -stream_loop -1 -i music.mp3：指定输入的背景音乐文件名，并将其无限循环。
                - • -shortest：将输出的视频的长度设置为输入的视频和音频的最短长度。这会使背景音乐自动截止到视频的结束时间。
                - • -map 0:v -map 1:a：指定输入文件中要复制到输出文件的视频和音频流。-map 0:v代表输入文件的第0个流，即视频流，-map 1:a代表输入文件的第1个流，即音频流。
                - • -c:v copy：复制视频流而不重新编码。
                - • -c:a aac -b:a 192k：将音频流重新编码为 AAC 格式，比原始 MP3 格式效果更好，同时限制音频流的码率为 192k。
                - • output_video.mp4：指定输出的视频文件名。
                - 您可以将其中的 input_video.mp4 和 music.mp3 替换为您自己的输入文件名，output_video.mp4 替换为您想要的输出文件名。
    - PDF相关
        - 作者在本地搭建了一个类似于ChatGPT的应用，借助OpenAI和LangChain，将PDF中的文本调用embedding API处理成向量，然后将向量存储到Pinecone数据库，最后做成一个聊天机器人，通过机器人实现了对PDF的查询，整个效果还是挺不错的。

    - 迷人的原理
        - [Man-Computer Symbiosis](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html)
            - 前两天有空又去读了一遍 J.C.R. Licklider 1960 年的那篇 Man-Computer Symbiosis，依然有很多收获。记录一部分思考和想法在这里。

Licklider 当年提人机共生的两个主要目的就是：1）让计算机像现在帮助解决形式化问题一样促进形成形式化的思考；2）使人类和计算机在不依赖预定程序的情况下相互合作，控制复杂情况和做出决策。

原文 3.1 节里的他拿自己举的例子其实很有意思，其中主要就是说「我大约 85% 的“思考”时间都花在了思考、做出决定、学习我需要知道的事情上。而花在寻找或获取信息上的时间比花在消化信息上的时间要多得多。总之，在我研究的整个时期内，“思考”时间主要用于基本上是文书或机械性质的活动：搜索、计算、绘图、转换、确定一组假设或假说的逻辑或动态后果，为做出决策或获得洞见铺平道路。」

从人机共生的角度来看，人类自身认为的很多思考实际上有很大一部分都是在克服信息的存储和检索效率上的不足，而机器在存储、检索和计算层面的优势和潜力都是远超人类的。

不管是神经通路、物流或者是其他系统，效率更高的通路自然而然会得到更多的 reinforcement。而在一个 symbiosis 共生体当中，当一个任务存在类似的多个执行通道的时候，那么这部分任务的执行也自然会依赖到速度更快、成本更低的通路上去。其他被解放的通路也并不会完全消失，而是会逐渐适用到现有的或者未来其他的任务上去，所幸 functional and structral neuroplasticity 都是人类神经系统比较擅长的。

从这个角度来看，当前以及未来 AI 因为带来的文本、语言以及形式化任务处理能力的提升在人类社会和日常生活中得到大规模的应用和集成是必然的趋势。而最后给人类留下多少智力和能力的发挥空间其实并没有那么重要，因为从 Man 到 Man-Computer Symbiosis 转变的过程中低效的环节和部分被替换是必然的。当真的转变完全发生的时候，我们需要关心的是整个 symbiosis 效率和能力是否有了更大的 boost。就像 Steve Jobs 当年的那个比喻一样："It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds." 当你骑上去之后，没人在意你蹬得有多快，重要的是你能前进得多快、多远。

            - 滴血的荒诞①：拾纸救夫

1965年全国开展社会主义教育运动，为文革热身。主要表达对毛的忠诚，查找有哪些对毛不忠的人和事。山东一位姓李的语文老师被人告发，说他在上课的时候讲过，毛当年在浏阳被敌人追得趴在水沟里藏身，这是赤裸裸诬蔑毛主席。伟大领袖怎么会趴在田间水沟里苟且求活？

学校马上翻遍学生们的书本，查看听课记录，终于在一个学生的语文课本里找到当时听这故事时记下的一行字：“毛主席藏身水沟，摆脱敌人尾追的机警故事”。

证据确凿，县公安局来人以“特大现行反革命案”把李老师抓走。李老师很不服气，他说：“这故事不是我瞎编的，是从书上看来的。”公安叫他说出是哪本书，他却怎么也想不起来了。没有根据，就是他瞎编，这是抵赖和顽抗！很快，李老师被判刑八年。

他老婆是个不识字的农村妇女，当时怀有身孕，跑到县里喊冤叫屈。县领导说：“你去找，只要你找到那个故事的根据，我们就放人！”这个女人信以为真，牢记在心，到处拾废纸，找人念给她听，希望大海捞针，能从纸片中找到这个故事，拯救自己的丈夫。这是她和孩子唯一的生活信念。不幸的是，她捡来的满屋子的纸片最终失火，反过来烧死了自己和孩子。

后来李老师刑满释放，在军宣队代表的帮助下，终于找到了那个故事的出处——《浏阳遇险》，作者是谢觉哉。最终据此平反。但那个为救他而捡了无数废纸的女人，却永远看不到了。

这个故事出自冯骥才《一百个人的十年》。
    - 语言就是武器
        - 注意你的语言
            - 第一，注意你的语言。因为它就是你的命运。
            - 怎么改变一个人的命运？很简单，改变你的语言，就能改变你的命运。简单到令人不敢相信。
            - 因为你怎么说话，你就会怎么思考。你说话的时候，你的意识就不断地在给你的潜意识灌输想法。一句话，即使是假话，套话，胡话，你听得多了，说得多了，内心里也就信了。所以语言会改变你的想法。
            - 孔子说：“非礼勿听"。不该听的不要听。为什么？因为你听了，即使你当时反对这个想法，它仍然会像种子一样进入你的大脑，在合适的时候就会生根发芽。听都不要听，你就不会有这个意识。没有这个意识，你就不会有这个想法。
            - 语言会改变思想。而思想会指引行动。如果你的行动是修身正己，造福他人，那么你就会得到别人的感激和报答。如果你放任自己，为害他人，你就会得到厌弃和憎恨。而你的行为和它们的回报，则会固化成你的行为模式。你长期的行为模式挑选和塑造了周国的环境和你自己，这就是人们所说的“命运”。
            - 所以你的语言就是你的命运。
