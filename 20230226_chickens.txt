Day 1:
Today I had three chicks. They are small and yellow. They are still very shy. I  want to see how much they will change in the coming weeks.

Day 10:

The chickens have grown in just ten days. They are more active than before. They love to run around. They are different. I'm happy to see how far they've come.

Day 20:
The chickens are now three weeks old, and they look bigger. They are now fully feathered. They spend their days playing at the ground. They have a leader now.

Day 30:
It's been a month since I got the chickens, and they are now fully grown. They are beautiful. They can even fight with cats and dogs. It's amazing to see how much they have changed in just a few weeks and I feel happy to witness their growth.
