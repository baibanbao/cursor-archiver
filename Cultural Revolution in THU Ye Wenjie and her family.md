Cultural Revolution in THU [Ye Wenjie.md](./Ye%20Wenjie.md) and her family

\[crowd shouting\]

\[in Mandarin\] Root out the bugs!

Sweep away all monsters and demons!

\[fervent chanting continues\]

Yes! I am a counterrevolutionary!

\[crying\] I beg you

to rehabilitate me!

\[crowd\] Strike down the counterrevolutionary!

\[Red Guard 1\] Bring out the next one.

\[shouting of slogans grows louder\]

\[spectator whistling\]

Rebellion is just!

Revolution is righteous!

\[crowd\] Rebellion is just!

Revolution is righteous!

\[rallying cries continue\]

Father…

Ye Zhetai.

Aren’t you a professor of physics?

\[calmly\] You should know.

You were my student.

Behave yourself!

\[crowd shouts\]

\[Red Guard 1\] Ye Zhetai.

In your physics course, did you teach the theory of relativity?

Relativity is one of the fundamental theories of physics.

How can a basic survey course not teach it?

You lie!

Einstein went to the American Imperialists

and helped them build the atomic bomb!

\[excited commotion\]

Bring up his wife!

She is a genuine physicist! She knows the truth!

\[crowd roars\]

Mother!

\[shakily\] Ye Zhetai!

With the help of the revolutionary youth,

it has become clear to me.

I want to stand on the side of the people!

\[public cheers\]

\[Red Guard 1\] Bow your head, Ye Zhetai!

Bow your head!

Bow!

\[grunts\]

Ye Zhetai. You cannot deny

you lectured on the counterrevolutionary Big Bang theory.

It is the most plausible explanation for the origin of the universe.

Lies!

The theory claims to know when time began.

Time began?

What came before time?

It leaves open a place to be filled by God.

\[shocked murmuring\]

Are you suggesting God exists?

Science has given no evidence either way.

\[outraged clamoring\]

\[Zhetai groans\]

Down with Ye Zhetai!

Down with academic authorities!

\[crowd\] Down with academic authorities!

Rebellion is just!

Revolution is righteous!

\[chanting intensifies\]

\[ominous orchestral music playing\]

\[groans\]

\[screams\]

\[Zhetai moaning\]

\[belt buckles clanging\]

\[sobbing\]

\[Zhetai cries out\]

\[crowd cheers\]

\[groans\]

\[daughter screams\]

\[cheering dies down\]

\[gasps\]

\[ominous music subsides\]

\[stunned silence falls\]

\[panting\]

\[whimpers softly\]

\[flags fluttering in breeze\]

\[Red Guard 2 breathing shakily\]

\[murmurs quietly\]

Let me go.

Let me go! \[crying\]

\[weeping\]

\[agonized sobs\]

\[wind picks up\]

\[somber instrumental music playing\]

\[somber music building\]

\[Red Guard 2\] Ye Wenjie.
