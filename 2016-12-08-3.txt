In order to use the Flowstate app which I purchased for 68 yuan. I will use it properly--to write in English.

Here is what I have typed in 5 minutes.

>Let me type some English. I love English. However, my ability of writing is not so good. I can express myself in this language, but I can’t express elegently. I can only use simple English, or Plain English, you may say as E.B.White has said. The reason why I’d like to write in foreign language is to create a new situation for myself. I am not young anymore. I need more practice to regain my vagor, to strenthen my memory and to enchance my confidence which all vaning in some respects. I need write day and night. I need put down all my glory and shame, happiness and sorrow, gains and pains without any hesitation. I like this app flowstate which enables me writing and writing. If I stop typing for 5 seconds, all the words I typed will disappear. Sounds cruel? That’s how life goes.

Not much words. But it makes this buy a wise one.
