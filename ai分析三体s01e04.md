The script is for the fourth episode of the science fiction series "3 Body Problem." It continues to develop the two main timelines:

1960s China:

Ye Wenjie meets with Mike Evans, revealing that she did something significant back on the hilltop in Shaanxi.

Modern timeline:

Jin and Will discover that Jack has been murdered, and Jin believes it is connected to the San-Ti and the VR game.

Investigators learn of an extremist group devoted to the San-Ti, an otherworldly entity, and plan to monitor their upcoming summit in London.

Evans communicates with the San-Ti, who struggle to understand the concept of lying and metaphors, leading them to express fear and distrust towards humans.

At the summit, it is revealed that the founder of the organization is Ye Wenjie, who believes that the San-Ti will save humanity from itself when they arrive in 400 years.

The summit is raided by the investigators, but the San-Ti protect the attendees, allowing Ye Wenjie and Evans to escape.

Jin is taken to a safe location by the investigators, where she begins to explain the events leading up to the current situation to Will.

Evans takes Ye Wenjie to a remote research base, where they plan to communicate with the San-Ti and prepare for their arrival.

Ye Wenjie, now in custody, warns the investigators that they have no idea what the San-Ti are capable of and that their arrival is inevitable.

Conflict:

The main conflict revolves around the impending arrival of the San-Ti and the opposing forces of Ye Wenjie's organization and the investigators trying to stop them.

Jin struggles with the loss of Jack and her involvement in the ongoing events, while trying to uncover the truth behind the San-Ti and their connection to the VR game.

Suspense:

The episode builds suspense through the revelation of Ye Wenjie as the founder of the organization and the San-Ti's apparent ability to protect their followers.

The San-Ti's fear and distrust of humans, stemming from their inability to understand lying and metaphors, adds to the overall tension.

Ye Wenjie's warning about the San-Ti's capabilities and the inevitability of their arrival creates a sense of impending doom.

Climax:

The climax of the episode occurs during the raid on the summit, where the San-Ti demonstrate their power by protecting the attendees and allowing Ye Wenjie and Evans to escape.

Resolution:

The episode does not provide a complete resolution, as it is part of an ongoing series. However, it sets the stage for the continued struggle between Ye Wenjie's organization and the investigators, as well as the looming arrival of the San-Ti.

The fourth episode deepens the mystery surrounding the San-Ti and their connection to Ye Wenjie, while raising the stakes through the revelation of their immense power and the growing conflict between the opposing factions. The episode ends with a sense of foreboding, as Ye Wenjie warns of the San-Ti's capabilities and the inevitability of their arrival, setting the stage for the remaining episodes in the series.
