- I Never Loved You More
- Lyric by Brecht
- Music/performance by Ano
- I never loved you more, ma soeur
- Than as I walked away from you that evening.
- The forest swallowed me, the blue forest, ma soeur
- The blue forest and above it pale stars in the west.
- I did not laugh, not one little bit, ma soeur
- As I playfully walked towards a dark fate –
- While the faces behind me
- Slowly paled in the evening of the blue forest.
- Everything was grand that one night, ma soeur
- Never thereafter and never before –
- I admit it: I was left with nothing but the big birds
- And their hungry cries in the dark evening sky.
- Bertolt Brecht
