We are the people who know the truth, but we don't want to surrender ourselves. We think that we can deal with that by our own strength. However, the Lord will teach us the lesson that we need.

All the suffering are the souvenirs which given by God.

We can't choose our destiny. The only way we know is to trust and obey.
