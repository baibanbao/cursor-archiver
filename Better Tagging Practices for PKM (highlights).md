    - if you use tags as part of your task management, consider reserving the @ only for temporal tags. It provides a shorthand for completion and helps to disambiguate the common words, e.g. #@today #@tomorrow #@this-week #@next-week ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1520675117/20066987))
    - Use-case: Status

I use these to track things like the stage an article Iâ€™m writing is in. I use the convention of status/ALL-CAPS, for example:

status/IN-PROGRESS

status/EDITING

status/PUBLISHED ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1520675117/20066991))
