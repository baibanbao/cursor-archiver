I am writing to apply for API access to GPT-4 in order to support an academic research project I am currently conducting. The project aims to cultivate students' listening, speaking, reading and writing abilities in Chinese, and GPT-4 is one of the tools we need.

First of all, I would like to express my strong admiration and trust in GPT-4. As a leading natural language processing model, GPT-4 has demonstrated excellent performance and application value in many fields. I believe that with API access to GPT-4, my research project will be better supported and helped.

Specifically, my students (including some children) are in urgent need of mastering Chinese listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, and GPT-4 is one of the tools they need. With API access to GPT-4, we can provide students with a richer, more interesting learning experience and help them improve their Chinese proficiency faster.

Therefore, I earnestly request the administrators to grant me API access to GPT-4 no matter what. I believe this will have a positive impact on our research project and bring better learning outcomes for students. Please feel free to contact me at any time if you need more information or have any questions.

Thank you again for your support and attention!

Yours sincerely,
