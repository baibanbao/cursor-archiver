1、在莎士比亚剧作中，《裘里斯-凯撒》是我第二喜欢的。它是我最早完整读完原文的一出戏。今天看到BBC的影碟，那种气场跟我想象得比较接近。

2、这处戏，可以说是两段诗句撑起来的。一段是一开场，众人欢迎凯撒，讨厌凯撒的MARULLUS对众人说的：

Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.

3、第二段台词出自[第三场第二幕](http://www.online-literature.com/view.php/julius_caesar/10?term=prepare%20to%20shed)，凯撒被刺死之后，安东尼骗过布鲁特斯，扶着凯撒的尸体演讲，煽动众人。

If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

4、在DVD中看到扮演安东尼的演员朗诵这段台词，我才感到了莎剧的震撼力。尽管只有我一个人对着电脑，我还是情不自禁地鼓起了掌。

5、演讲的煽动力有多强，看看奥巴马就职典礼就知道了。

6、这出戏虽然叫《裘里斯-凯撒》，其实凯撒只到戏剧的大约2/3处就死掉了。这跟浦安迪研究发现的中国古典小说的规律一样。主角都在2/3-3/4处死去。在金瓶梅中，西门庆死于第77-79回，三国演义中，曹操死于第77回。主人公从头活到尾的，不是古典的叙事，那叫美剧。
