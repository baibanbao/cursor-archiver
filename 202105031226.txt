Yesterday morning, I had experienced something like death. I got up in the morning very early. Without having breakfast, I went to the Hengshan Road International Church. Hunger is NOT a real thing, but a kind of feeling. As I have got the addiction for food, it is a good opportunity for me to quit overeating, I thought.

You couldn't find brotherhood in this church. Nearly no one knows no one and even the volunteers are not so accessible. When I found that seats were occupied by some believers for their partners, I was irritated and wanted to leave immediately. Only my patience told me to stay and wait.

The hymns were in very high tone and hard to sing with. The prayers were long and empty. The sermon were boring. Besides the preacher standing on the stage were women which was contradicted to what Paul taught in the Bible. Women shouldn't be the heads of men. It's written in the New Testament. 

As it went on, I felt very uncomfortable. My brain was half-numb because of lacking of oxygen. I was very sleepy and tired. I should have left there earlier. 

After coming home, I was still dizzy. Fortunately, my wife and son went out, so I could sleep like a stone, a piece of wood. 

I need to write the voice of my heart. I don't want anyone to listen right now. I want to retreat and be totally alone. 

Next Sunday, I won't go to the Hengshan Road Church. I have another plan.

In order to express myself, I set up this blog. Why I choose the domain name ohmylife.org is to remember an late website ohmylife.com. I used to write on that site for 30 days and that was such a great memory. 

I need to rethink my life. I need this place. 

So let me steer this site like an stolen plane. I just want to see the whale and her poor baby. I just want to drag a ship over a mountain. 

I just want to be alive and feel like that.
