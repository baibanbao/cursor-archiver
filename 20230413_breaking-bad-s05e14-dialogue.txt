Hank Schrader: [to Walter, as Jack has a gun pointed at him] You're the smartest guy I ever met... but you're too stupid to see... He made up his mind ten minutes ago.

Hank Schrader: My name is ASAC Schrader and you can go fuck yourself.

Hank Schrader: Do what you're gonna do.

Walter White: I watched Jane die. I was there. I watched her overdose and choke to death. I could have saved her. But I didn't.

Walter White: And now you tell my son what I do after I've told you and told you to keep your damn mouth shut. You stupid bitch. How dare you?

Skyler White: I'm sorry.

Walter White: You, you have no right to discuss anything about what I do. Oh, what the hell do you know about it anyway? Nothing. I built this. Me. Me alone. Nobody else!

Walter White: Pinkman. You still owe me.

Uncle Jack: If you can find him, we'll kill him.

Walter White: Found him.

Walter White: What the hell is wrong with you? We are a family.

Walter White: You mark my words, Skyler. Toe the line, or you will wind up just like Hank.

Skyler White: Walt. Tell me what happened. Where is Hank? Please. We need to know.

Walter White: You're never gonna see Hank again. He crossed me. You think about that. Family or no. You let that sink in.

Todd: Sorry for your loss.

Holly White: Mama.

Uncle Jack: Jesus, what's with all the greed here? It's unattractive.

Walter White: I've still got things left to do.

Uncle Jack: Didn't cross your mind to maybe tell us you had a DEA agent for a brother-in-law?

Walter White: I told you, Skyler. I warned you for a solid year. You cross me, there will be consequences. What part of that didn't you understand?[b]n[/b]

Uncle Jack: Whoa, simmer down there, sparky.

Skyler White: Flynn, could you put your seatbelt on, please? Please, it's not safe.

Walter White, Jr.: You're shitting me right? If this is true, and you knew about it, then you're as bad as him.
