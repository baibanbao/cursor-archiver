        - # Faith Alone: A Daily Devotional
        - ## Martin Luther, James C. Galvin

        - > Erfurt
        - > Luther was a professor, theologian, former monk, scholar,
        - > author, Bible translator, and defender of the faith. But he was
        - > also a pastor, husband, father, and good friend to many.

        - > He forcefully preached and defended the doctrine that we are
        - > justified through faith alone—plus noth- ing.

        - > But the first dimension of the Christian life—faith—is more
        - > essential. The sec- ond dimension—good works—is never as
        - > valuable as faith.
        - > Faith should be first. After faith is preached, then we should
        - > teach good works. It is faith—without good works and prior to
        - > good works—that takes us to heaven. We come to God through faith
        - > alone.

        - > **thundering of sin, the shaking of death, and the roar of the**
        - > **devil, the Holy Spirit in our hearts begins to call out, “Abba!**

        - > **powerful and horrible shouts of the law, sin, death, and the**
        - > **devil. It penetrates through the clouds and heaven and reaches**

        - > Suffering doesn’t occur apart from God’s will. It’s not a sign

        - > Moses commanded the Israelites, who had been bitten in the
        - > desert by poisonous snakes, to look at this bronze snake with an
        - > unswerving gaze. Those who did so were healed, simply by
        - > steadily gazing at the snake alone. In contrast, others who
        - > didn’t obey Moses looked at their wounds instead of the snake
        - > and died.
        - > **I believe in Jesus Christ, God’s Son, who suffered, was**
        - > **crucified, and died for me. In his wounds and death, I see my**
        - > **sin. In his res- urrection, I see the victory over sin, death,**

        - > I understand what Jesus is saying here in the simplest manner,
        - > so that it all applies to this one person, Christ. Jesus is
        - > called “the way” because he is the beginning, “the truth”
        - > because he is the one who helps us continue, and also “the life”
        - > because he is the end. For he must be everything—the beginning,
        - > the middle, and the end of our salvation.
        - > So if you hold on to Christ in faith, then you have started in
        - > the right place. If you remain with him, then you will be

        - > Waiting to pray is an unchristian approach to prayer. It’s a
        - > teach- ing that comes from the devil.
        - > David trusted in God’s mercy and began to pray, “Lord, even
        - > though I am a sinner, have pity on me.” The time when you feel
        - > your sins the most is exactly the time when you most need to

        - > When we receive what we ask for in the Lord’s Prayer, we are, in
        - > effect, receiving heaven and earth and everything they contain.
        - > For when we ask for God’s name to be kept holy, for his king-

        - > Christian’s condition is a source of wonder! For Christians are
        - > both sinful and righteous. They are sinful because of the sinful
        - > nature they carry with them that is contaminated by sin. They

        - > Because of God’s mercy and grace, David received God’s approval
        - > and was made holy by a righteousness completely out- side of
        - > himself. God’s mercy and grace aren’t human emotions or
        - > attitudes. Rather, they’re a divine blessing we receive by
        - > believing that our sins have been forgiven in Christ. Because of
        - > Christ, we can expect mercy and compassion, as David did in
        - > Psalm 51. So the righteousness we receive comes completely
        - > outside of us. It’s a genuine gift from God, who is
        - > compassionate and merciful to us because of Christ.
        - > Suppose a man deserving the death penalty was brought to a
        - > prince’s court. But the prince released him out of compassion,
        - > even though he deserved nothing but death. Wouldn’t you say that
        - > this man’s guilt was forgiven, not because of anything he had
        - > done, but because of the kindness of the merciful prince? Yet
        - > it’s not enough for this man to be forgiven for the crime he
        - > committed. He also must be released from jail, must be given
        - > clothes to wear, and must find a job so that he can live. The
        - > same happens to us when we receive God’s approval. After God in
        - > his mercy frees us from guilt, we still need the gift of the
        - > Holy Spirit to clean away what sin remains in us. We need the
        - > Spirit to strengthen us so that we are not overpowered by sin
        - > and our corrupt desires.

        - > Dear brothers and sisters, it’s impossible for you to become so
        - > righteous in this life that you won’t feel sin anymore. It’s
        - > impos- sible for your body to become as bright and spotless as
        - > the sun. Though you still have wrinkles and spots, in spite of
        - > this, you are holy. But you may wonder, “How can I be holy since
        - > I sin and feel sinful?” Recognizing and feeling your sin is
        - > good. Thank God, and don’t despair. It’s a step toward health
        - > whenever a sick person recognizes his disease. “But how can I be
        - > freed from sin?” you wonder. Run to Christ, the Physician who
        - > heals the broken- hearted (Psalm 147:3). He makes sinners holy.

        - > If you are doubting or uncertain, or if you are merely trying a
        - > prayer to see what happens, your prayer won’t be worth anything.
        - > For you aren’t keeping your heart steady but let- ting it wobble
        - > back and forth.
        - > This is why we say the little word Amen at the end of our
        - > prayers. We use it to express our firm, heartfelt faith. It’s
