#### A Letter 
 
Dear Rainbow:  
 
You have been waiting for something for many years. But you were disappointed every time when you opened your door. It was the postman. It was the wind. It was nothing at all.  
 
We are living in a changing era. Traditional values lose its favor; other values takes its position. Peace and simplicity is on the way out; sound and fury is on the way in. Many books has been written, few are worth of reading. In a time of entertainment, everything can be entertained.  
 
As far as I perceive, You have never departed the time of innocence, the time of simplicities, when good is good, truth is truth, and most questions always have answers.  
 
But now, everything is different. Just as a joke goes. 
 
> Outside a mental hospital, people noticed that a man with an umbrella was always standing there no matter what weather it was. One day a passerby couldn't help asking: "Do you mind I asking you a question?" 
 
> The man was startled and said: "I don't as long as you are also a mushroom." 
 
In our life, we are looking for another mushroom. It is universally true. 
 
I should say that Liumiao is a perfect partner in your occasion. He is upright, resilient,and daring to be himself. He never surrender his will either to his parents or other authorities. That's very rare in most parts of China. I am glad to know that he is treated so highly in your heart. 
 
If he had the same feeling as yours, it would be a very happy romantic story. Both of you like freedom, decency, and beauty of life. So, the obstacle over there is not conventional wisdom, nor age, nor other external elements. The only question is his heart, what he feels, what he dreams and what he plans for his life. 
 
I want to quote the dialogues of my favorite movie Some Like It Hot. 
 
>Jerry: Oh no you don't! Osgood, I'm gonna level with you. We can't get married at all. 
> 
>Osgood: Why not? 
> 
>Jerry: Well, in the first place, I'm not a natural blonde. 
> 
>Osgood: Doesn't matter. 
> 
>Jerry: I smoke! I smoke all the time! 
> 
>Osgood: I don't care. 
> 
>Jerry: Well, I have a terrible past. For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player. 
> 
>Osgood: I forgive you. 
> 
>Jerry: [tragically] I can never have children! 
> 
>Osgood: We can adopt some. 
> 
>Jerry: But you don't understand, Osgood! Ohh... 
> 
>Jerry: [normal voice] I'm a man! 
> 
>Osgood: [shrugs] Well, nobody's perfect! 
 
Maybe I should quote another one, which is my another favorite, and I think is also your selection. 
 
> William: I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are, my mother has trouble remembering my name. 
 
> Anna Scott: I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. 
 
You know that it is from the movie Nottinghill.  
 
What shall I do? What can I believe? What can I rely upon? You may ask.  
 
The answer resides your heart. Trust it, cherish it, and above all, pursue it. I wish you will find what you love and dream. You deserve it. 
 
All the Best to you and Carol.
