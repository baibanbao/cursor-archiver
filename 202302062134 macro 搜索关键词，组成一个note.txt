@MartinBB I had the same reaction. Sounds great but it showed nothing in the note. A few small changes and its work wonderful.

Had to brew install findutils to get gxargs
Had to be sure gxargs is in Keyboard Maestro's path - path added to Keyboard Maestro variable 'ENV_PATH` = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
Totally spaced about gxargs, you're exactly right, apologies and thanks for pointing this out.
