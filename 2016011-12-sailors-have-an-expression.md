- E .B. White是《风格要素》《夏洛的网》《精灵鼠小弟》的作者，1974年3月有一天他接到一封读者来信，信中表达了他对人类对自己的失望。74岁的 E. B. White读者回了一封信。
- Dear Mr. Nadeau:
- As long as there is one upright man, as long as there is one compassionate woman, the contagion may spread and the scene is not desolate. Hope is the thing that is left to us, in a bad time. I shall get up Sunday morning and wind the clock, as a contribution to order and steadfastness.
- 只要世上还有一个正直的男人，只要还有一个富有同情心的女人，观念就会传布，风景就不会荒芜。在坏时辰，希望是留给我们的好东西。每个礼拜日的早晨，我都起床为钟表上好发条，为秩序感和稳定性尽一份绵力。
- Sailors have an expression about the weather: they say, the weather is a great bluffer. I guess the same is true of our human society – things can look dark, then a break shows in the clouds, and all is changed, sometimes rather suddenly. It is quite obvious that the human race has made a queer mess of life on this planet. But as a people we probably harbor seeds of goodness that have lain for a long time waiting to sprout when the conditions are right. Man’s curiosity, his relentlessness, his inventiveness, his ingenuity have led him into deep trouble. We can only hope that these same traits will enable him to claw his way out.
- 水手关于天气有一种说法，他们说，天气是个最会虚张声势的家伙。我猜这也同样适用于人类社会，事情看上去很灰暗，接着云层透出一道光亮，所有一切都变了，有时很突然。很明显，人类在这个星球上过着奇怪而糟糕的生活。但是，作为个体，我们也许应该守护已经播下的善意的种子，等情况变好时，发芽生长。人的好奇心，他的不顾一切，他的创造力，他的聪明会给他带来大麻烦。我们也只能希望，这些同样的禀赋能让他辟开一条生路。
- Hang on to your hat. Hang on to your hope. And wind the clock, for tomorrow is another day.
- 抓住帽子，抓住希望。为闹钟上紧发条，因为明天是另一日。
- Sincerely,
- E. B. White
