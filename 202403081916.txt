Peter Lynch: The Wisdom of Walking Away
彼得·林奇：放弃的智慧
“I remember standing in the rain [at my daughter’s soccer game], cheering her on, and thinking, ‘I want to see more of these.’”
“我记得站在雨中（在我女儿的足球比赛上），为她加油，心想，‘我想要看到更多这样的场景。’”

Peter Lynch is an investing legend for two big reasons.
彼得·林奇是一个投资传奇，有两个重要原因。

(1) At the tender age of 33, Lynch took the helm of Fidelity’s Magellan Fund — with just $20 million of assets under management — and transformed the mutual fund from a small afterthought into one of the most successful wealth-creating vehicles in the history of the money game.
在33岁的年纪，林奇接管了富达的麦哲伦基金，管理着仅有2,000万美元的资产，并将这只共同基金从一个小小的被忽视的存在转变为金融史上最成功的财富创造工具之一。

He earned a mind-boggling 29.2% annual return between 1977 and 1990, ballooning Magellan’s value to $14 billion by the time of his retirement. And Lynch did it by combining dogged (some might call it workaholic) research with a common sense appreciation for opportunities right under his nose.
他在1977年至1990年期间获得了令人难以置信的年回报率29.2％，使麦哲伦基金的价值在他退休时达到了140亿美元。而林奇通过坚持不懈的（有人可能称之为工作狂）研究，结合对眼前机会的常识性认识，实现了这一成就。

Lynch unearthed profitable investment ideas by simply paying attention to which brands and stores his family gravitated to at the mall — or which restaurants they frequented most often.
林奇通过简单地关注他的家人在购物中心倾向于哪些品牌和商店，或者他们最常光顾的餐馆，发掘了有利可图的投资理念。

In this way, he cashed in on the rise of Dunkin’ Donuts (Lynch loved their coffee), Hanes (his wife alerted him to the L’eggs craze), La Quinta Motor Inns, Stop & Shop, and many more. Lynch fully leveraged his consumer’s edge to make gobs and gobs of money for his clients.
他利用了唐恩都乐（林奇喜欢他们的咖啡）、海恩斯（他的妻子让他注意到了腿袜的热潮）、拉金塔汽车旅馆、停止和购物等等的崛起赚了一大笔钱。林奇充分利用了他作为消费者的优势，为他的客户赚取了大量的钱。

(Now, as always, a word of warning: Lynch never said to run out and blindly buy stock in your favorite companies. But, rather, to use your own preferences and observations as a jumping-off point for further research. No shortcuts here.)
现在，一如既往，警告一句：林奇从未说过要盲目购买你最喜欢的公司的股票。相反，他建议以自己的偏好和观察作为进一步研究的起点。这里没有捷径。

Another secret to Lynch’s success: paying close attention to insider buying. “In the early- to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, [insider buying] was the #1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right time to buy a stock,” remembers Jerry Sullivan of Putnam Investments.
林奇成功的另一个秘诀：密切关注内部买入。普特南投资公司的杰瑞·沙利文回忆道：“在80年代初到中期，当我为彼得·林奇工作时，[内部买入]是他在寻找合适的买入时机时最重要的因素。”

All in all, Lynch well deserves his spot on the investing version of Mount Rushmore.
总的来说，林奇完全值得在投资版的拉什莫尔山上留下他的一席之地。

(2) But it’s for an entirely different reason that Peter Lynch remains an exemplar of the money game.
但是彼得·林奇之所以成为金钱游戏的典范，原因完全不同。

Unlike so many others, he knew when it was time to walk away — and then did so in 1990, at the height of his fame, with no muss, fuss, or lingering looks back.
与许多其他人不同，他知道何时该离开，并在1990年达到事业巅峰时毫不犹豫地离开了，没有任何纷扰、麻烦或回头的眷恋。

Those thirteen-plus years running the Magellan Fund had not been easy on either Lynch or his family. “I have a very small transmission,” he once admitted. “My gear box has two speeds — off and overdrive.”
那十三多年来管理麦哲伦基金对林奇和他的家庭来说都不容易。“我有一个非常小的传动装置，”他曾经承认。“我的变速箱只有两个档位 - 关闭和超速。”

And, looking at Lynch’s prodigious workload, “overdrive” might be an understatement. He visited hundreds of companies each year, conducting on-the-spot research of management and operating performance, all across the country. When not traveling, he was holed up in his office poring over annual reports and other filings — leaving no stone unturned in his quest to grow Magellan’s money.
而且，看着林奇的巨大工作量，“超负荷”可能是个轻描淡写。他每年访问数百家公司，在全国范围内进行现场管理和运营绩效的研究。当他不在旅行时，他就呆在办公室里仔细研究年度报告和其他文件，不放过任何一个细节，以增加麦格尔的资金。

80+ hour work weeks don’t leave much time for anything else and, eventually, something had to give. “You know you’re in trouble when you need a Cray computer (a super-computer of that era) to arrange your free time,” he joked.
80小时以上的工作周几乎没有时间做其他事情，最终，必须做出一些让步。他开玩笑说：“当你需要一台Cray计算机（那个时代的超级计算机）来安排你的空闲时间时，你就知道自己有麻烦了。”

And, to Lynch’s eternal credit, he ultimately chose his family over the allure of more and more money. “I remember standing in the rain [at my daughter’s soccer game],” he said, “and thinking, ‘I want to see more of these.’”
而且，要归功于林奇，他最终选择了家庭，而不是越来越多的金钱的诱惑。“我记得站在雨中（在女儿的足球比赛上），”他说，“我想要看到更多这样的场景。”

So Lynch shifted his gear box to “off” and left Magellan behind. He traveled the world with his wife, devoted more time to his growing daughters, and used his remaining energy to mentor new Fidelity analysts and raise money for charitable causes. In particular, Lynch worked closely with the Catholic Schools Foundation to provide faith-based education to inner city youth.
于是林奇将变速箱换到“关”位，离开了麦哲伦。他与妻子一起周游世界，更多地陪伴着正在成长的女儿们，并利用剩余的精力指导新的富达分析师，并为慈善事业筹集资金。特别是，林奇与天主教学校基金会密切合作，为城市内的年轻人提供以信仰为基础的教育。

Even though he kept an office at Fidelity headquarters in Boston, there would be no instantly-regrettable “Michael Jordan on the Wizards” comeback attempts. Lynch walked off into the sunset and never marred his unbeatable record with a second (or third) bite at the apple.
尽管他在波士顿富达总部有一个办公室，但他不会像“迈克尔·乔丹在奇才队”的回归尝试那样立即后悔。林奇走向了夕阳，从未因第二次（或第三次）尝试而玷污他无可匹敌的记录。

If he had any regrets, he didn’t show it. “For me, it was all like hot fudge sundaes,” he said. “I liked my job, I loved my family, and I liked working with outside charities. It became a matter of, ‘How much can you handle without getting a stomachache?’”
如果他有任何遗憾，他没有表现出来。“对我来说，这一切都像是热巧克力冰淇淋”，他说。“我喜欢我的工作，我爱我的家人，我喜欢与外部慈善机构合作。这成为了一个问题，‘你能处理多少而不会胃痛？’”

And Lynch seems even less bothered by the prospect of someone else topping his Magellan record. “I don’t keep score,” he said in 2021. “I’ve got ten grandchildren … That’s what I keep score on.”
而林奇似乎对其他人打破他的麦哲伦纪录的可能性更不在意。“我不计较得失，”他在2021年说。“我有十个孙子孙女……这才是我关注的。”

Interestingly, Lynch may have retired even earlier if not for the naysayers in the mid-1980s who claimed that Magellan had grown too big and could not replicate its past success. “The critics probably kept me on the job an extra four to five years,” he said. “They got my Irish up.”
有趣的是，如果不是20世纪80年代中期那些声称麦格兰已经变得太大，无法复制过去成功的唱衰者，林奇可能会更早退休。他说：“批评者可能让我多干了四到五年的活。他们激怒了我。”

(In typical Lynch fashion, he proved the doubters wrong with a 34.5% gain in 1989, his last full year before retirement. The man knew how to go out on top.)
在典型的林奇风格中，他在1989年最后一个完整的退休年度中证明了怀疑者的错误，获得了34.5%的收益。这个人知道如何以最好的状态离开。

When Lynch did finally head for the exit in 1990, his all-too-rare decision attracted a lot of attention from both the financial press and the wider world. Over 1,000 letters of support poured in from admirers of his choice to prioritize family time over his bank account.
当林奇最终在1990年离职时，他这个罕见的决定引起了金融媒体和广大世界的广泛关注。来自他选择将家庭时间放在首位而不是银行账户的支持者的支持信件超过了1000封。

“I loved what I was doing,” Lynch said, “but I came to a conclusion … What the hell are we doing this for? I don’t know anyone who wished on his deathbed that he had spent more time at the office.”
“我喜欢我所做的事情，”林奇说，“但我得出了一个结论……我们到底为什么要这样做？我不认识任何一个人在临终时希望自己在办公室多呆一些时间。”
