My desire is burning in this midnight,
When I am thinking  of you.
Your everything is real.
Your eyes are real.
Your lips are real.
Your shoulders are real too.

What a night.
What a day.
If I touch the realness of you.
Even you are dressed up.
In the moonlight, or
In the sunshine.

Maybe we just drink a cup of tea.
Maybe we just watch a movie.
Maybe we just walk along the river.
That's enough.
Because that's real.

I know what I have been desired. 
I never desired an abstract kiss.
But a real kiss from your real mouth.
I never desired an abstract hug
But a real hug from your real arms.
I never dreamed abstract breasts
But your breasts with cherry fire, my dear
Instead of touching them,
They touch me.
Your cherries, slowly and softly
Rubbing mine.
I catch one of them like a dragonfly
In my palm, I am holding tight.

I am imagining to touch your whole body
I am kissing every inches in my imagination
I am going to bury myself in you
From evening to morning

That's just the beginning.
You know where I am going to go.
But that's the next chapter of our book
I am satisfied now
And I want you to be satisfied
Call my name in the dark.
Otherwise I will go no further
Hold my body in the twilight.
Because I am also real to you.
Let me dig and dig.
Guide me to your secret garden
I will explore the weeds
I will find the stream
And dive into your well
And from there to ocean deep.

You will see shooting stars.
Then we will be both real.
