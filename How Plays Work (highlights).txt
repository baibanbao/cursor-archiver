    - to name and describe those techniques, to position them in categories, and to gather them together into a theory. In ([Location 22](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=22))
    - the stage play is as tight a form as the eighteenth-century sonata. ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=37))
    - the park scene in The Man of Mode. ([Location 62](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=62))
    - And writers who’ve read any twentieth-century literary theory are understandably irked by the arithmetical reductionism of so much thinking in this field, with its mechanical lists, symbols, charts and graphs. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=170))
    - audiences have certain expectations of what they’re going to see in the theatre and they cannot be required to check those expectations in with their coats. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=173))
    - Playwrights should know the rules because they are the possession of the audience, their essential partner in the endeavour. They won’t be thanked for sticking so closely to the rules that the play is predictable from start to finish. But nor will audiences readily accept their expectations being wilfully ignored.

    - The playwright David Hare sees theatre as essentially meteorological – like the weather, it happens when two fronts meet: what the actors are doing and what the audience is thinking. The literary critic J.L. Styan insists that ‘the play is not on the stage but in the mind’. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=181))
    - Dr Johnson’s dictionary defines a play as: ‘A poem in which the action is not related, but represented; and in which therefore such rules are to be observed as make the representation probable’; we apply that test to the story even as we engage with its course. As J.L. Styan puts it, ‘The audience is continuously busy, whether consciously or not, making personal comparisons with what it sees and hears on the stage.’7 ([Location 189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=189))
    - Drama’s capacity to point up connections is one of the reasons it has – historically – been so successful in comparing and contrasting different worlds: the objective and the subjective, the individual and the collective, the personal and the political, the worlds of the family and the state. Drama can bridge the two great sources of our experience: our direct, lived, first-person biography and the much wider range of experience and knowledge that is reported to us second- or third-hand. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=235))
    - memory is the connection. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009YMCJ2C&location=250))
    - A merchant, father or king dies or departs, leaving behind him an injunction (don’t look in the cupboard, don’t go into the forest, don’t open the box, read the book, or eat the apple). This injunction is violated, which leads to the appearance of a villain, who steals or harms a person or their belongings. A hero is commissioned to defeat the villain and to rescue his victim. Journeying to meet the villain, the hero comes across a personage who engages (or entraps) him into a task, for which he receives a reward whose value is not immediately apparent but which becomes crucial later on (it may be a steed to get to the villain, or a weapon, or a magic object, or a skill like being able to speak to animals). Arriving at the villain, the hero employs his magic weapon to defeat him. He returns home, only to find he has been usurped in his absence and his identity is denied. The hero then proves his identity by the passing of a seemingly impossible test of strength or endurance (in The Odyssey by pulling a great bow; in the Christian story by rising from the dead), he wins his bride and comes into his kingdom.
