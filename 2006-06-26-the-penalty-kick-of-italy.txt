[《太阳报》](http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2006290247,00.html)：The penalty appeals were brushed aside by Spanish ref Cantalejo but he had no second thoughts about Grosso's dive over Neill, allowing Totti to put himself in the Italian good books again.

[《卫报》](http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/minbymin/0,,1788421,00.html)足球评论员：Lucas Neill looks gobsmacked - it was a soft enough penalty. Grosso was dribbling in from the left, Neill foolishly comitted himself to the tackle and the Italian committed himself to falling over in as extravagant a fashion as possible. The referee had no hesitation in pointing to the spot.

[《The Times》](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,28749-2244140,00.html) : But the Roma forward, who broke his left ankle in February, settled a fiercely-contested second round tie by firing home from the spot after Lucas Neill was harshly adjudged to have brought down Fabio Grosso with ten seconds left of injury time.

Grosso tumbled over Neill in the box, rather than appearing to be brought down, and up stepped the number 10 to send the Azzurri fans wild with joy.
