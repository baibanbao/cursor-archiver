Hey guys. How you doing? You good? Okay. I've traveled to Ecuador, a small country in South America that until recently was largely unknown in China. But now, hundreds of Chinese arrive every day. America that until recently was largely unknown in China. But now, hundreds of Chinese arrive every day. Because it's the closest country to the United States that allows Chinese passport holders to enter visa-free. In the capital Quito, I soon come across this small group of Chinese. They're willing to be filmed, on condition that we don't give out their real names. So we assign them aliases. Uncle Wang, Auntie Lan, Jayden, and Chubby Chef, who worked as a cook in China. They looked like any group of Chinese tourists that one would encounter anywhere in the world. And that's the story they had to stick to to get into Ecuador. I asked her when she was going back. I asked her if the hotel was booked. I asked her in Chinese. Oh, oh. Then she asked my sister, are you going to America? I said, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh! I said, I know. I said, I know. I said, I know. She said, okay. It's their first time out of China, so even with a mission, they want to have fun. And try new things. Consolata a mi pelle del Signore Amata il corso del Mure Vida che mi amore ha prescindito To cheer Uncle Wong up, we head to a Chinese restaurant. The term they mention, zòuxiàn, literally translates to walk the line in English. It's a newly coined expression on the Chinese internet referring to exactly what they're doing, taking long and arduous detours to reach America.你花了多少钱 现在的预期是走啊还得花多少钱正常的话 至少要10个左右都拿得出来这个钱吗有卡啊 信用卡这些你那么年轻 你信用卡没有这个额度有 信用卡有10万块钱走线以前基本上都是南美人很穷的国家中国是非要第二大經濟體怎麼那麼多人來走線呢那疫情這三年疫情把老闆娘啃上了自己做買賣出來弄不到二年賠了二百萬把錢全部賠光了嗎自己的錢賠了連新房都沒住上這就是出來開始納悶办现在就有五来,说不两来,不好玩不好玩因为像我,人家是一个小小的加工厂做皮具的可能这四年总共亏损了差不多九十多万一看就知道没有钱现在还有一点路费可害怕在国内像我這麼大年紀基本上打工都沒人要今年56去那邊不管多大年齡只要你肯做像我們也是想投奔自己說實話好不容易我不要感謝拜登我也感受到上課時拜登真的感謝他如果不是他愿意接纳这些文革难民的话我们这些也不敢跑虽然我心里面可能对特朗普共和党我觉得可能还他的政策可能对美国有利一点但是拜登对移民好 I plan to vote for Trump. And I believe all my family, we're going to vote for Trump because we do need a change in this country. Our town is so small, if you go too fast, you're going to come to the open border. And that's where immigrants come into this country. ¶¶ Somebody from the other side probably telling them where that entrance in offense is. The Mexican. ¶¶ As you see, right here to the left, And the fence is the Mexican. As you see right here to the left, there is an open border right here. That's where they're coming from. That's where they're coming in, right here. My property was like this before, over there with the burning now. It's had inches. It was over there. There was a lot of grass. It's fire hazard. That's what she's talking about. They do whatever they want to do. They burn on your property. They use the bathroom. They don't clean up after themselves. They drink the water, throw the bottle there. Can I take them out of there? I took my gun, and I shoot in the air, four bullets. The police arrest me. They even border patrol tell them leave them alone. They cannot move them out of there. You know, I think Chinese have more right than we do here. I can see their leader, I can see their well-being and all that, but I don't understand why they come over here. I really would like to know that myself. Back in Quito, we moved to a district where the Chinese migrants find lodging, a guesthouse catering almost exclusively to the walk-the-line crowd. There's just this random pot of cash i think left by past guests and they got these actually from the country so they have traveled Thailand. I know this one. This is from Hong Kong. What's this? Qatar Central Bank. The migrants often stay here for a few days to rest and mentally prepare for the Darien Gap. and mentally prepare for the Darien Gap. A dense jungle between Colombia and Panama that till this day has no roads, so crossing it requires walking on foot for up to a week. The guest house owner, originally from Beijing, agrees to speak to us only if we conceal her identity and the location of the property.就是这几个政府包括阿尔伯多尔大家不太在乎现在所有的旅馆都生意也不是很好是吧都是靠这些人那这些人是不是要吃点东西要住个旅馆最起码要坐它这个大巴它等于是给这个国家也带来了很多的这个所以人家还挺开心的您估计有的旅人死过中国人我估計,女子運營死不成本了一個老鄉,北京人他是六十多歲了,他也是在我這住她是六十多歲了她也是在我這住6月17號去年我記得很清楚她晚上就跟我說說的我今天晚上連夜坐船走然後進了雨淋就沒再出沒有再生意了我覺得她已經不在了因為她沒有理由不跟我聯繫 After the rain, I stopped cooking and doing business. I think he's gone. He has no reason to not contact me. What do you think of them going to the US? I think it's really a bit too much. They've already left. I can't stand their pace. They don't have the patience. At the same time, there's trouble within the group we met the day before. Jayden and Chabi Shef want to pay a smuggler to get them to the entrance of the Darien Gap, but have been slow to confirm a time for departure. While Uncle Wong and Auntie Lan are eager to hit the road and want to save money by navigating the journey on their own. So after receiving last-minute yellow fever vaccinations, the pair set off for the road. First a five-hour bus ride to Taukan, a small town on the Ecuadorian border with Colombia. A trip that my security adviser Paul says can go dangerously wrong. Ecuador is becoming a narco country. We now have a lot of cartels into Ecuador. You always get news about someone getting killed, a place that's getting bombed. Even the schools are in danger now. But with a bit of luck, Uncle Wong and Auntie Lan arrive at the border incident-free. Unlike in Ecuador, Colombia requires a visa for Chinese passport holders to enter officially. A local man offers to take them through the unofficial channel for a fee away from the camera. At the same time, I get a first-hand experience of the border town. Some guy just whistled at me from that shop, which is full of Chinese people. I think the smuggler might be thinking I'm one of his merchandise. After a brief hiatus, the journey continues. Just after dark, they arrive at a bus interchange on the Colombian side of the border. A large South American family is setting up camp for the night. We're going to Pasto. Pasto? Family? Familia. Familia. They too are hoping to go to Pasto, the first major city in Colombia. But as it gets dark, the road ahead gets dangerous. The family plans to sleep rough. The woman is clearly pregnant. We were overloaded with baby stuff. Babies moved through so fast we could barely even see them. Yeah, yeah, they take them first. So, anyways, we don't really need that. I gotta get going, because I'm feeding people right now. What percentage of them would you estimate are Chinese? I would say my guess is that on a day, on most days, upwards of 50%. Most of the people who are coming from China are not really familiar with camping out, staying out in the country, dealing with the kind of harsh situation that we have here because they seem to be mostly urban people to my, my lucky, my reckoning. They come from a very orderly society. And as you will see in the moments here, this is not a particularly orderly situation. Hola! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! All we got is fruit, sandwiches, and water. We're gonna move some water back. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! World famous P.E.N.J.s! I am in the boat! Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Six, five, seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty. Sixty people. Yesterday we spent, we fed about 750 people. I have been doing this continuously for about 10 weeks now. It's really hard to get a bunch of Chinese people to line up at a queue. I think people are really worried that there might not be enough food for everybody, so they just want me in the front of line. And they're right, there might not be enough food for everybody, so they just warned me in front of one. And they're right, there might not be enough food for everyone. Sad to say. There, I can see at least 30 people right now. There's probably more coming in behind. Border Patrol doesn't do anything except kind of point them in this direction. They give them a colored wristband. The patrol doesn't do anything except kind of point them in this direction. They give them a colored wristband. These other colored wristbands, that's the day of the week. They pretend these people are not being detained by saying, oh, look, they just decided to stay here all by themselves. Oh, stay here for up to four days, sometimes five days. It's a complete legal fiction. Anybody have red? White? Green over here. Back on the road, Uncle Wong and Auntie Lan are getting ready to board a flight. They hope to get from Pasto in southern Colombia to Nicocli in the north, where the track through the Darien Gap starts. The sudden arrival of the Chinese migrants has left an impression on the locals. Even the airport staff have now mastered a few words in Chinese. As it gets close to departure, more Chinese-looking people turn up, some with young children in tow. in tow. Jayden and Chabi Chef also arrive for the same flight. Once we've boarded, it's clear that almost a third of the passengers are Chinese.我住在老家養牛養了兩年了他說未先拍到的然後又把你拆掉又一分錢沒有補助然後就說你幾個房子發了你一手的記事你見好了嗎他又說你違章你把你拆掉一分錢沒有補助我從十幾歲出來從一無所有做到负债人我用了二十多年来打拼我觉得我是个很精明的人我也是个很努力很成功的人但是都没有办法活得下去有这么多国家可以治愈为什么一定要去美国呢别的国家你要经过正常的移民指导 Why do you have to go to America? In other countries, you have to go through normal immigration. If you go early, they won't take you in. They'll fine you. In the US, it's a very tolerant country. On this flight, we also meet a family from Chengdu. Mom, Dad and 13-year-old Lucy. Cheerful and outgoing, they stand out among the nervous Chinese migrants. So good. Once in Akakali, I make plans to shadow the family. They're rooming with a few other Chinese migrants. And today, they need to go shopping for the upcoming Darien crossing.原来南美人只收一美人直接我们中国世界第二大强国肯定是身价高我们该出去再吃饺子只有你这里我们来吃饭我们在这里吃饭所以我们来吃饭我们来吃饭我们来吃饭我们来吃饭对谢谢去超市里买点巧克力买点东西买巧克力要买好凉快罐头要不要买不要他们买了好多方便面我说你干嘛吃他说带了什么炉子他买了个炉子我买几个方便面种不起来的对你不要想下去要不然你自己買個爐子但是你不要動背不動你這個思維是錯的你這個思維是居家過日子的你的思維應該是去那個野外生存的這個思維有壞的魔杖所以說你把爐子買過來啊我認為你方便麵都不要我去搞牛肉乾我才不要吃你的因為我的牙齒都牙口不好我還是買幾個方便麵可以可以對我尊重你的選擇嘛我還是買個爐子我背一遍我吃你的油我的牙齿都不好我还是买几个吧好啊可以对我尊重你的选择我还是来个楼楼背一楼不外甥第一名第二名KID中国家庭那是不是要买个叉子 Yeah.

That's a lot of money. Oh, this is a big problem. It's not a big problem. It's just a matter of time. It's a matter of time. Yes, you're right. Yes. The way they talk about the Darien Gap, it's simply men versus nature. But I know it's a lot more than that. When I was still in Quito, a friend heard about my travel plan and called me up. Once a senior politician in a Latin American country, he's done extensive work in the area and still advises governments in the region. In order to give me his honest opinion, he asks me not to reveal his identity and disguise his voice. Let me tell you that this is very challenging, difficult and perhaps a very dangerous project, especially in the Darién area. There is not much presence of either Colombian or Panamanian police or any type of governmental presence because it's an area that has always been deserted. is an area that has always been deserted. And there are several different groups of criminal gangs that operate. They make profit out of the problem of people that need to travel and migrate. Use violence. There have been reports of raping women, mistreatment of young people, children, and young women to be given to other gangs that are involved in the social, sexual trade and the prostitution chains and that sort of things. Is there something that Wade should or absolutely should not do? So I will be very careful about filming in front of people that you don't know that might feel threatened by disclosing their identities and do you have a satellite phone yes i do watch out with that you need that and try not to use openly in front of people that you don't know because they might think that you are communicating with somebody else, especially if you're going to be talking in foreign language or English. Okay, so they need assurance that whatever information we have will not be given to authorities. Exactly. If you have a good fixer, he should be able to arrange the terms with the people that are the ones in charge. The criminal gang that controls the Darien is also Colombia's largest drug cartel. I obviously have no personal connection there. So I shouldn't go try and talk to that guy. I don't think the guy is going to probably give you an interview. So I've asked a journalist's contact in Colombia to help me out. Carlos has reported from the Darien Gap several times and today we sent him off again into the jungle to ask for permission for us to enter. That looks very quiet. Is that normal? The last time I was here was last April, and it was a lot more people. What do you think? It's been 20 days, a month now, it's too much. It's gone down a lot. People want to stay at home in December. You think it's like the Christmas season and all this stuff? Oh, yes, yes. Yes, the South Americans want to spend Christmas at home. It's been happening, and it's been happening, a lot of Chinese and a lot of Ecuadorians. I'm going to get my ticket first. Carlos is heading to Cabraganá. Most Chinese migrants are headed there too, where they will wait until nightfall and sail again in the dark to reach Careto in Panama, where their track starts. Yes. Delicate articles, cameras, things like that, phones, personal stuff, because the company doesn't take responsibility if it gets wet. I hope you come back with good news. I hope so. The most important thing is you come back, yes? No, I will. No worries about that. OK. Otherwise, we're going to have to go look for you. Otherwise, you have a kicking ass that, man. OK. All right. Otherwise, we're going to have to go look for you. That's why you have a kicking ass story, man. All right, man. OK. Yeah, take it easy. Good luck. Take care, guys. I'll see you in a bit. Thank you.
