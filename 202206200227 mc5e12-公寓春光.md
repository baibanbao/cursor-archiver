- 非常可惜，天妒英才。他这个是中国情景喜剧写得最好的第一人，也是中国写相声写得最好的一个人。就是当年他的相声就是曾经多次上过春晚，并且在春晚上一炮走红，一般都是姜昆。姜昆在表演姜昆和唐杰中，当时他的最经典的代表作叫这个虎口遐想，说他掉到一个老虎洞里啊，掉到一个动物园的老虎的洞里，然后大家去救他的故事。这个想象力之奇鬼之奇妙，而且对现实社会的讽刺是非常非常。这个就突破现在的尺度的，但这并不是他那个相声的巅峰，他在相声的巅峰叫特大新闻，特大新闻。这个相声在今天简直是听起来也就是离经叛道，不单是不能说，甚至这个发表估计文字都不会不敢出现。但是当年这个特大新闻就出现在元旦晚会上，他说没出现在春晚，因为春晚怕这个也是尺度太大了就发就但是在元旦晚会也是向全国在全国观众面前表演了。他讲的是说有有一天这个天安门市场天安门广场改成了农贸市场。然后这个这个人大代表一边开会一边看着这个农贸市场，这个就现场解决这个老百姓生活中的问题。比如说这个有个大姐说这个早晨收过一次税了，现在怎么又来收税。这个人大代表一看说应该降低老百姓的负担就是他他就他把想象力完全地释放出来。并且这个相声当年是很受好评，如果现在说的话估计早就被举报了。
- 但是这个梁总他就英达决定做我爱我家情景喜剧的时候，他先找了王硕，王硕是跟两朵不认识的，但是跟英达认识。于是这个英南又推荐了梁总。梁总他当时记他是北大毕业的一个，这才是真正的 PKU 他是北大毕业的一个高材生，他毕业之后就一直在一在好像在曲艺研究所这种工作单位工作，但是他业余就创作很多很多的相声。中国所有的那个那些年的春晚，从 85 年开始一直到 92 年，就基本上他都参与了，并且他是深度参与。就是春晚组开会的时候都会把他请去。那梁总他有他的这个真正的天才，就是在我爱我家中得到了充分的释放。就在这个原原先王硕和英达策划的时候，这个我爱我家，他也是讲一个。老干部家里有个女儿，女儿有两个女儿，其中一个女儿招了一个女婿，就是女婿是倒插门的讲这么一个故事。但是当他们讲的时候，他发现讲不下去，因为这些人都没有倒插门过，就是他没有生活经验。
- 第二个就在北方，这种情况很少见好像很少见。所以她们觉得还是请梁左来把把关。梁左一看，说你这个故事就不对，应该是她们家有个儿子和儿媳妇，就是就变成了现在一个结构。就是为什么梁左会这么想呢？因为梁左的爸爸就是一个老革命，她的母亲叫陈荣，这是中国的著名的一个作家，就是当年改革开放以来的一个作家，代表作是人到中年，还拍成过电影。这个就是梁左的。梁左的弟弟叫梁天，她还有一个妹妹叫梁欢。所以说这个我爱我家的家庭结构跟他家差不多完全一样的。家庭结构就是他所以写自己生活中的事他就非常非常的有感觉。加上他又擅长写相声，所以他把相声的技巧和这个情景喜剧融合在一起。并且当时这个所有的这些人物都是在睁眼的，就是就是现场演了之后，观众在下面看的时候就把他们的这个笑声也录进去。所以那些笑声都是现场发出的笑声。
- 如果你仔细听的话，有几集甚至能听出蔡明魔性的那个笑声，因为蔡明在里边也演也演一个人物，演他们家的邻居叫艳红待会我们会看一个片段，就这个我爱我家，现今天看来不是所有的每一集都好，但是有几集是大放光彩的，就是他把当时的那种社会现象和社会中的人有机地结合在这个情景喜剧里边。
- 比如说这个这里边就是当两佐最后去世的时候，他出了一本文集叫孝旺书。在孝旺书这里边，这个这本书是王朔给的编的，就选了我爱我家它其中一集，这一集就是他的集。第 22 集他讲的就是这家的一家之主叫老付。老付其实是一个老革命的形象，就是但是我爱我家的这个剧的就是魅力之所在，就是每一个人他都不是脸谱化的，每个人他都是他的人物，都是多变的。比如老父虽然是个老革命，但是当他的年轻时候的女同学来找他的时候，他还是怦然心动的。所以他就这个故事就围绕老父的年轻时候的初恋情人来找他慢慢展开。
- 就是他里边特别他的所有好笑的元素都出于人物的这种性格的冲突，一个很正经的老革命，天天在家里教育子女要老老实实，但是他自己又有心怀这个怀春。所以这个故事就看了就会让人会心一笑。就所有的人物他都不是那种固定的纸片人，而是有发展变化的这种人物。那我们来看一下。
- 这一集。好消息。好消息。这个首都机场的高速公路马上就要修成了，集中人人心呐。呦爸我这还有一更激动人心的消息。学时代的一女同学给您来电话，不要开玩笑，我们上中学的时候可跟你们现在不一样啊，那真是国难当头危亡之秋啊什么男同学女同学我中学没有念完就去参加革命了，凡是说好像叫什么文仪什么的。你说什么？文怡她现在在哪里？不是你要咬我呀，你在吓着圆圆。
- 没事，爷爷您跳您的，我一点都不害怕。
- 快说文艺他现在在哪里？他现在还吗？活活着活着死人能打电话吗？而且声音还特别清晰。文怡。19431944。都快半个世纪了。我疯了。
- 我说爸，您踏踏实实坐，那待会来电话了，您再起来接也不晚，谁说我在等电话。
- 你是谁？何平你电话。快一点打，不要老占着电话。
- 谁。于大妈要赞助，不是，我跟您说我们不是不交，要不然这样得了我姑姑这等长途，您回头再打。好，谢谢您，你说这鱼的妈也是，要修一破自行车棚子要好几回赞住了。爸找您来吧，他还是容易的骂，他说，他要直接跟您谈。
- 我不在。爸，我看您今天情绪也是反常，不是到底怎么回事，您能不能先跟我们透露一下，也让大家有个精神准备。满意您的文艺女士要找上门来的。诶说来还就来了没了，把您悠着别摔着啊哈哈。
- 老付啊，这都老熟人了，还迎接干什么哈。
- 我说爸您就回屋，到时候有电话我叫您。那样会耽误事的，已经耽误一次了，就不要再耽误了。不是您跟这个姓文的到底是怎么当的事。拖来话长，往事依稀，魂思梦都随风雨到心头啊。爸您抽空跟我们也说我不给您传去啊，反正您现在也是单奔，您要想再往前闯呢，也没人敢拦您啊得您接着憧憬。
- 来吧不用，来了。来了来了。
- 没人叫您，您来就来。来了您就坐下吃吧，有什么事您慢慢说，什么来了来什么呢？
- 电话文怡他现在就在北京了好。一会他就来你们赶紧把房子都打扫一下好嘞好布置一下何平你和小张马上准备午饭啊不要怕花钱好嘞啊什么贵什么好，你就买什么啊。
- 您放心，我这就上西单菜市场买俩王八去。
- 我说爸这姓文的是什么人呐，您连这艰苦奋斗都不要了，我艰苦了一辈子，奋斗了一辈子，好不容易有这一回我就换换样。我们这个老同学，那可是书香门第大家闺秀，在学校那会吃饺子的时候，人家是光吃肚不吃皮。呦这就叫大家闺秀，撑死了就是一土财主。当天我也是这么说他爹我说他行，你说他可不行，说不行就不行。呦这后妈还没进门，就不带着我们这前房儿女了。
- 爸，待会您拥抱的时候留神别赶着要。爷爷这么来了吧，于大妈你又是于大妈。
- 于大妈说，居委会有位奶奶找您，不给您在这。
- 你怎么啊？
- 你都认不出我来了。
- 瘟疫，你都老成这个样子了，您自个也不年轻，那这位大妈您坐这我爸不会说个话，您甭跟他一般见识，全瞧我了，瞧我了。
- 静贤不会说话，他年轻的时候是最能讲会道的。
- 那哈。
- 你二位玩，不是你二位聊。
- 聊聊啊哈。
- 你喝茶。
- 哎薇娅这几十年你是怎么过的？
- 就是再再看一集的小片段，就是这一集他的人物都是比较鲜火的，就是这个人你一看他就没有什么这个就是不会是固定的那个一个刻板的一种。这一集是很多人认为是这个我爱我家的巅峰叫庆巅峰到我家。然后这个为什么是巅峰呢？就是因为它里边的那个演员演得好，这个演员叫韩怡，在渴望中演那个渴望中的女主角，然后后被客串到这个这个电视剧里边。因为它是这个韩颖的是曲艺团的，所以他就是一举一动都有这个江湖江湖人士的这种特点，他起的名字也很有意思，叫老何。老何在北京话里就是这个江湖人士的意思。那这一开始就是这个老夫开家庭会议，说这个和平的妈，就是亲家母要装修，这个家里要待不下来，就是要在这住几天。然后这个她的女婿就是这个贾志国是反对的，但是架不住老父同意这个。于是丈母娘就来了，这个丈母娘一亮相就好，我们就从丈母娘来这儿开始。
- 爸。
- 爸治国好治国。我妈来了。哎哎哎呀老区长。
- 好久没见您，您老身子数可好啊。
- 不要叫局长叫老父。老何同志，您也好吧。
- 托您的福。老局长，我是酒也喝得，饭也吃得打，他一两小麻将都不带犯困的。
- 哈哈您快请坐啊哎呀啊路上累了吧。啊诶您怎么都不叫人呢。妈您来了啊。
- 姥姥，您来了。
- 你们俩该管我叫庆娘，叫庆。
- 我还是宁肯，我小一辈，我随着圆圆管，您叫姥姥得了。
- 哈姥姥哈。
- 老局长，给您添麻烦怪不落人呢。您看您又派车派人去接我，透着那么关心民众，替天下情，我这心里头啊像是打翻了五味瓶，酸甜苦辣咸一起永新接妈。
- 妈妈没人接，您是我自个打地接的，你看。
- 哈，妈知道妈是顺人情。
- 老何同志，您看您到我们这来，我这也没什么准备，我让志新，把他那屋子给您腾出来啦。
- 可不行，志新和小凡姑娘住哪。
- 这个志新回头就在客厅搭床，小凡今天就回学校去了。
- 好不好？依我说呀，就在和平那屋集体让志国搬出去，跟志新他们哥俩住一屋，小凡姑娘要是回来呢也能在客厅搭床。哎得了，大伙就依我这主意，赶快准备吧。
- 别给你妈寄回去，强迫咱俩分居。妈让您怎么住，您就怎么住。您挨这说是客人客水不便呐。
- 那不行，我不能挤他的治心在客厅搭床挤的你挤的治国，那是我闺女姑爷那活该。这志新招谁惹谁了。
- 您甭为我费心。
- 那不占理的事我可不能干。老局长，您就让我在客厅搭床。这个和平。哎拿包立马送妈回家。
- 别老何同志，那您就在客厅搭床，我就是怕这孩子们出来进去的，吵得您休息不好不爱的。
- 只要不忘我炒他了就成啊。您知道我是唱曲的出身，这拳不离手，曲不离口，前天早起五点钟啊，我就得喊嗓子再活动，活动这筋骨来个腰子翻身驴打起什么的，我不愿意在外头练，怕人家看见笑话就得在屋练您甭管了，待会，让和平帮我把这沙发往那边挪。腾出场子来，明早上起来我好练呐。
- 老何同志，您这个勤学苦练精神可佳，值得我们学习。
- 嘿老局长，您这么大岁数还这么爱学习，真给我们老同志做了榜样了。
- 哪里您忙您的去。
- 我没事闲着也是闲着陪您说会话，省得您闷得慌。这报纸上有什么好消息您给我讲讲，也让我高兴，高兴也没什么 A 老局长，那柬埔寨大选结果该出来了吧，咱们 5 克到底选中没有，还让人惦记着。国际版我还没看。
- 要不您先看不。
- 不，我自个不爱看报废脑瓜子，就爱听人讲黑老局长，这国内形势怎么样啊？党的十四大以后一片大好吧，那京九铁路一期工程完工了没有啊。
- 明天没有这方面的报道。
- 那净登些什么？净登那些影视明星乱七八糟的事。嘿老局长，依您说那巩俐张艺谋能不能过到一块。
- 这个我怎么能知道？
- 这个也没当，那都当些什么这么着吧，老局长，我呀跟您探讨这办报的方向。
- 对不起，老何同志，我先出去一下。
- 没关系，您帮您的等您回来，咱们接着探讨。
- 老何同志，快请坐。
- 不爱的，你们先吃回头我吃点剩的就成。
- 您看您老这么说和平，快让你妈坐下吧。
- 没事你们吃吧，我就爱吃柘萝哈，你们吃岭的就当我没在这哈。
- 拿您瞧您，您让我们怎么吃，每回吃饭都得跟您费半天话。
- 那我可就不客气了，我就实话实说得了，您说这米饭我吃不惯。麻烦小张姑娘再给我下点面条吧。还打卤面不费事，弄点肉末，打俩鸡蛋喝点。黄花、木耳、香菇、清蒜。石油这么一过，尺寸这么一勾，出锅的时候，撬上点葱姜，再撒上点香油，齐活了。
- 哈，来。
- 我不爱看那些乱七八糟的电视剧，我先歇着，明早上起来，我好练成功了。
- 这个。哎妈妈您先到我们这屋躺会去等你看。
- 不，我不看了，我先回屋了。
- 那您先到园。哎呦我也该睡觉了，老板世鑫让我妈上你那诶。
- 让咱姥姥踏踏实实跟这坐着，我不如我得，我洗，那我也先回屋了，这个老何同志。
- 您赶快歇着吧。
- 他们都走了，那我就先不睡了。
- 给妈换个频道看看哪台还多，可望咱们家俩一块看。
- 感谢你妈，要是再不走，我可走了。我有他这么欺负人的，还是劳动人民，比地主只等家混又厉害，受多大苦受多大累我就不说了。可他整天打我当贼似的房子，每天买菜回来跟爷爷报一遍账，还得和他再报一遍。那天我买的土豆一毛五一斤，他说电视里报的市场最低价是一毛4，所以说我两只土豆赚了你们家两分钱。后来我一打听，他看的那电视是湖北台，石家庄的土豆是一毛四一斤。喂了两斤土豆，我还跑上石家庄，这气死我了。
- 很多人就是记住我爱我家，就记住这两字，它确实好，这个这里边就是我再举一个例子，就是证明它的前瞻醒。在这个第四集，就是蔡明演了一个他的邻居叫叶红，这个叶红其实是一直喜欢就是梁天眼的贾志新的，但是他一直不说出来。然后但是每当这个贾志新来这个相亲的时候，或者跟别人约会的时候，他就过来破坏这个这里边有一段戏，我觉得很具有前瞻性。来我们看一下这个。
- 请问先生您要点什么？
- 一罐椰汁，一听这个啤酒。小姐请你们老板亲自送来，你跟他说贾志新总经理来了，说的时候小点声，别吓我。稍等他一听，我的名字立马就会颠颠跑来的。
- 看来你是这的常客吧。
- 那也得分，怎么说？那会倒是常来。这个地方原来是个公共厕所。这装修以后，我还是头一回来，还挺像那么回事。
- 就是味有点不正我看你跟他们老板还挺熟的。
- 也不算太熟。
- 他原来是呦窒息，你这该死的来啦。讨厌小芳告诉我来一什么。贾总经理，我说也真不了吗。别跟我还这蒙式。
- 你别跟我吓走了。那什么我来介绍一下。
- 嗨，这还用介绍吗？不是见过好几回了吗？你们见过这不是你常带到我这来那位芭蕾舞团的于小姐吗？
- 什么叫于小姐？
- 哦我记混了。猴小姐。哈，那位空姐吧，不飞啦。
- 哪又蹦出一猴小姐呀？
- 人家是朱小姐。
- 我也乱了，人家是牛小姐牛莉莉对吧，在外企工作。
- 认识多久啦？才一个都一个礼拜。太长。我们志新交女朋友一般三天就吹。
- 那是她们看不上我嫌我。
- 嫌我们志新啊，同时交好几个女朋友哈怎么了？为什么不可以脚踩几只船呢？
- 不不，我是最反对谈恋爱的时候。
- 脚踩几只船也对，等结了婚再踩也不晚。
- 当然那就更不对了。
- 贾志新，你不是一再向我保证你是个感情专一的人吗？对，那没错，我们之前就有这特点，别看交的女朋友多，跟谁都是逢场作戏，甭管俩人那关系走到多深，他绝不把感情轻易投进去。我估摸着他打生下来，到现在一点感情都没遭见，把最好的爱都留给你了。跟那些女孩子都到多深的关系了？没有多肾？其实也就是有一个追我们志新追成了神经病，还有一个自杀未遂摔成了一条腿。还有一个一年到医院做了 12 回瘦，别说，我还想多活几年。
- 就我那那个你这不是够胡编吗？你这个丽。
- 这是当年我的母亲，这是我父亲翻过这一页。这就是我哥哥，他怎么在这这个。
- 这是我妹妹，等等先把那妹妹给我看不。
- 这妹这个她这也没什么可看的。
- 哈哈这是谁啊。
- 我这是什么？也不是这个。她就是一个街坊，一个同学，没有什么关系不对吧。
- 这是不是你过去的女朋友。他。
- 就他你太小瞧我贾志新了，我告诉你谁正眼瞧过他呀，我看你先听又干又瘦的一脑袋黄毛跟苞米碎了似的。知道小时候我们管他叫什么吗？老玉米贾亢你怎么又来了？欸这不是不这这这这这位姓马小姐马芳芳我这就是那个坐坐吧。
- 你刚才管他叫什么甲亢？对呦你得过甲亢。是不是那大脖子？遗传吧。
- 我没有得过这个病，这是小时候他们瞎给我起的外号。那个甲因为我姓甲胖，因为小时候我比较爱尿炕，我还有那么多好的。外号军长老四胡汉三什么的，你怎么不提。
- 我可没听说你叫胡汉三。我倒记得小学三年级的时候，我们叫过你二傻子，你为了争先劲愣从家里要了一毛钱交给老师，说是路上捡的。
- 那也比你真捡了一毛钱，不教老师买两根冰棍吃强啊还一根巧克力，一根奶油的，左一口右一口美的你呀。
- 这根巧克力的，后来我不给你了吗？
- 那还不如我抢回来，做了以后你没辙才给了我吗？
- 我说你们二位能不能等我走了以后再争。还是马小姐说的对。志新，咱们别老回忆，那些不愉快的，怎么还好些温馨的呢。窒息呢，打小就是老实孩子哈哈哈。放好了说呢是模范儿童，说白了呢也就是窝囊废哈哈哈，在学校挨了大嘴巴都不敢哭，回还得我给他报仇去哈哈是吗？哟你可更有福气的。假抗。
- 不对吧？初二那回我打架开头为谁，还不是巴黎那帮子老跟胡同伙劫你，是我挺身而出，脑袋上还抬着一板砖。
- 啊对呀，类似我们可真够青梅竹马的呀，你可千万甭信他的，就这么一回英雄救美人，他能记一辈子。
- 一回。打上小学五年级。我不送，那个打上小学五年级到初三五号大院那帮臭流氓拍你多少回，没事走就走无所谓，咱们把这事得掰扯清楚哈哈坏了，我钱包还跟他煽着呢哈哈。
- 站住哈。干什么干干干什么干什么干什么？你让人看你算怎么回事啊。
- 出来。德行对你说，你是不是想彻底搅黄我娶媳妇这事，以便取而代之。
- 你别自我感觉太良好。切我告诉你，哪怕这世界上就剩下你一个男人。
- 别把话说这么绝，这世界上剩我一个男人，你还不跟我携手并肩面对大自然，跟野兽搏斗啊。
- 剩下别人也许会是这样，剩下你，我只能先跟你搏斗完了，再跟野兽搏斗。
- 你既然别无所求，就别老跟这里边搅和了。
- 成不成，我完全是因为不忍在看到无辜女青年被你成批残害。
- 我谈害谁了？我发誓我每次谈恋爱都是认真的，不是我跟你说你说我这岁数我容易吗？你说那真好的，谁守身如玉的等着咱呢。我跟你说我真是这么想，除了你咱是个权和人，我凑合嫁他就完了。哈，就求你高抬贵手，别再干干涉我的恋爱自由了。
- 成不成我干涉你？贾志新从小到大你就没少干涉过我的恋爱自由，这么些年我还没计较呢。
- 真是新鲜，我干涉你，我巴不得你赶紧嫁出去得了哈。
- 初三四班的袁刚跟我谈朋友，被人暴打了一顿，再也不敢理我了，这事是不是你找人干的？
- 我是保护你为你好。
- 那上高一的时候，我跟咱们教体育的王老师通信，被你报告了学校，害得王老师调离，害得我在学校里抬不起头来。
- 这也是保护我。当然了，姓王是专门玩弄女性的坏人。
- 坏人谁坏？听说后来王老师表现不错，在监狱里被评为模范犯人，三次见了行了。
- 抓起来了。好好。那你怎么不说感谢我及时挽救了你，反而为此向我进行疯狂的反攻，倒算不是你现在什么心理，你还不应该算是老姑娘吧。我告诉你老玉米不管你如何打击报复，我也绝不会低下高贵的头，你破罐破摔，还想把我也拉下水。我告诉你，明我非找一优秀的，我让你开开眼。
- 就是两朵厉害在就是他他把相声这一技巧写到了这个情景喜剧里。但是其实这个喜剧还有另外一种形式，就是我们在编剧故事营，这已经办了武器。就是每期的时候我们都会放一个比利怀尔德的电影，比利怀尔德他是这个我们知道他是一个斗欧人，他去了美国之后，他就开始先做一些杂物，然后慢慢地就成了一个电影导演。他的喜剧片有一个特点，就是永远不会过时，我们会看到很多的电影，尽管在当年很好，但是后来就慢慢地觉得它的时就是丧失了时效性。但是比利华尔德不是这样比例，华尔德的电影永远是它的主题，永远是令人就是那在每个时代它都会散发出新的光芒。比如说我们看过它的热情似火，就是这个杰克雷蒙演的那个两个人演的这个男扮女装是吧，就是这种喜剧，它永远是散发着这种光辉。我们还看过日落大道，日落大道讲的是一个过去的女过气的女明星啊和一个落魄的编剧之间的故事。这个电影也永远是散发着光芒。不是因为说这个行业永远存在，而是在每个时代都有被这个时代所抛弃的人，他们依然活在这个过去的辉煌里，而不顾现实世界的变化。今天要介绍这部电影，其实是比利华尔德更有名的一个电影，是最后就是他在 1960 年拍的一部黑白电影，叫公寓 apartment 这有国内有两种翻译，一种叫公寓春光，一种叫桃色公寓。其实在英文就是 the the apartment 就是公寓，它讲的就是我们现在所说的打工人的故事。
- 就是他讲一个小伙子讲一个捷克雷蒙演的一个公司小职员，他在一个保险公司上班，但是他的老板们他的上司们都盯上了他的他租的一套公寓，因为那个地方离着公司非常近，并且他是单身这这个于是大家就用各种方法要到他的公寓里去约会。当然约会的都是一些很可怜的这些姑娘都是临时认识的或者公司里的夏季职业。这个杰克雷蒙就是他在里边叫巴特斯特，她持一个就是一心想上想这个获得升职的小职员。所以当这个他的上司们要跟他要公寓的钥匙的时候，他没办法拒绝，他不敢拒绝。否则的话，这样他有可能就丧失自己的职位，更重要的是他会丧失这种被提升的可能。于是这就演出了这样一个故事，就是一个人在公司里这个想往上爬的一个故事。这个很现代，在这个故事在任何一个时代都会引起人们的共鸣。并且比利华尔德的喜剧它有个特点就是它和它有悲剧的成分，它虽然是喜剧，但是你会感觉它很看的时候会觉得很伤感。好这个故事一开始就是他晚上下班之后想回家，但是回不了，因为他的公寓又被一个上司给征用了。
- Good evening, Mr. Vaccine Louis Lieberman, some weather. We're having must be from all that mishegoss at Cape Canaveral. You're locked out of your apartment no no just waiting for a friend. Goodnight, Mrs. Lieberman Goodnight, Mr. Back.

- Mr. Kirby I don't like to complain but you were supposed to be out of here by 8.
- I know buddy boy, I know, but those things don't always run on schedule like a Greyhound bus well.

- I mean, it's just once in awhile.
- I have a few people in for a drink as a matter of fact you must be an Iron Man, all around. From what I hear through the world, you got something going for you, every night. I'm sorry if it gets noisy and sometimes there's a finite doubleheader. I'm nervous like you.
- Yeah well.
- I'll see you down, you know, Baxter I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center. I wonder if you could do us a favor me when you make out your will and the way you are going you should. Would you mind leaving your body to the University?
- My body afraid you guys would be disappointed.
- Slow down kit.
- For.

- And now Brian Hotel, starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, shown proper. Wallace Berry and Lionel Barrymore. First, a word from our alternate sponsor friends do you have wobbly dentures?
- Hello hi, yeah, Buddy Boy.
- I'm in this bar on 61st St and I got to thinking about you and I figured I'd give you a little buzz well.
- That's very nice of you, but who is this noobish Joe Dobson administration. Oh yeah, Mr. Dobbs don't recognize your voice that's OK.
- Buddy Boy. Like I was saying, I'm in this joint on 61st and I think I got lucky.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Dobosh I'd like to help you fellows out, but it's sort of late. So why don't we make it some other time listen kid? I can't pass this up, she looks like Marilyn Monroe? I'm already in bed and I've taken a sleeping pill. So I'm afraid that if answer is no look back.
- There were making out the monthly efficiency rating and I'm putting you in the top 10 now. You don't want to touch yourself up to you.
- Of course not, but how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night? It's only 11 and I just want the place for 45 minutes.
- Only when you talking to anyway, my mother.
- That's sweet that's real sweet.
- Make it 30 minutes. What do you say buddy ha ha.
- I'm all out of liquor that there's no clean glasses. There's no cheese crackers know nothing.
- Let me worry about that. Just leave the key under the mat and clear up.
- Yes, Mr. Dobosh anything you're saying. Large travel at all, Mr. Dobosh. Next we never close funny boys. Looks like Marilyn Monroe.
- Is the place? How much 70 cents get the money with you? Watch to Steelers. Keep a bucket thanks lady. Put it back honey. Add a girl. This is such a good idea can't think of a better one. I mean purging in your mother in the middle of the night don't worry about the old lady one support from her and she's out of a job.
- Get the key with you. Not there under the mat.
- I need a man come on.
- Open up open up we haven't got all night.
- This is your Mother's apartment that's right.
- 就我们知道这是个喜剧，但是这个喜剧它的配乐是非常忧伤的。其实它讲的其实是在城市里，这些打工人就是那个时候的工薪阶层，他们的备案。就是很多人他可能是独居，他下班之后只能一个人回到家里，但是还有更可怜的人是他有家也回不了。就像这个这里边的巴特尔先生一样，就是你会看到这个就是比利华尔德，它喜剧的高明之处就是它把喜剧和悲剧融合在一起，并且他的人物都是真正这个生活中可以找得到依据的人物。比如说这个人要升职，他要打工，他要讨好他的上司。就是在比利华尔德的喜剧中，这些人物都不是那种，就是不食人间烟火的那些人物，他都要生存都要去工作。所以供应春光，即使今天看来也是很有力的。并且它这个你会发现比利华尔德能让每一分钟都不枯燥，就每一分钟的这个戏都有用。
- 其实他回到家到这个到他在流浪到街头，其实大部分时间都是他一个人在演，但是这个戏一点都不枯燥。你会看到他看电视这个桥段，就是看的都是那种，要么就是西部片，要么就是插播广告，然后再看他这个就是他的上司，她的那个人事部经理要用他的公寓，就说这是给她妈妈打电话，这个她把她妈妈这个梗用了三遍。
- 第一个是在电话亭在酒吧的时候，第二次就是那个她带回来的那个玛丽莲梦露说不会打扰你妈吧，她说不会，如果是我妈敢抱怨的话，我就让他失业一语双关。然后这样就是有了这样一个铺垫之后，现在这个戏才真正开始。因为女主角才刚刚登场 20 年，那个时候的电梯都是有这个电梯驾驶员文档。其实在 90 年代的时候，你要去城市里也都是有一个人在那负责按电梯，这个时候是一个正式的职业。
- Skip。

This there was no suicide note or anything believe me. Doc I'm not thinking about myself aren't you? She's got a family and there's the people at the office look can't you forget you're a doctor. Let's just say you're here as a neighbor.
- Well, there's a doctor I guess I can prove it wasn't an accident. But as your neighbor. I'd like to kick your keys to clear around the block mind. If I call this off so I don't know what you did to that girl in there and don't tell me but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now pay later Diners Club.

- That's impossible. You'll have to handle the situation yourself, Baxter as a matter of fact. I'm counting on you.
- Yes, I understand, she left a letter would you like me to open it and read it to you? Well, it was just a suggestion. No, you don't have to worry about that. I kept your name out of it, so that you know trouble for these wise or newspaper Wise. You see the Doctor is a friend of mines were very lucky in that respect actually think she's my girl. No, he just jumped to conclusions around here, I'm known as quite a ladies man. Of course, we're not out of the Woods yet. Sometimes they try it again. Yes, Sir I'll do my best. It looks like it'll be a couple of days before she's fully recovered and I may have a little problem with the landlady. Alright Mr. Sheldrake I'll keep in the apartment as long as I can isn't there. Some sort of message you want me to give her. I'll think of something. Goodbye. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Dexter Kubelik. What are you doing on the bed.

- 时间有点长，但是这个电影绝对值得好好看，因为它真的得到喜剧的精髓。哪怕就告诉你这么一个故事，让你写成两个小时 05 分钟，其实是任何人办不到的，就是换了其他人都办不到。因为他的故事非常非常精巧，每一个细节都用得恰到好处。所以这个片子还是值得进一步看。
- 因为这个电影你会发现其实很它它好在哪呢？就是它非常符合人性，就是他不是那种只骗人或者都是那种就是概念中的人物，就是这些人物都是有血有肉的。并且你看这个就是库布里克小姐，当她这个痊愈之后，她还是主动去找了这个就是她的那个上司，实际上这就是人性，她并没有人强迫他们这么做，就是就就好像这个 buster 也是，他也并不是说就是别人强迫他去把这个钥匙给人，他们都是没人强迫的。但是在制度，在这种条件下，人就会有一种其实还是自主选择。就所有的你看比利华尔德笔下的人物，就是他镜头中的人物都是这样，就是他在有自主选择的情况下，比如选择了这个一条道路，一条错的道路。但是他们有一种很强大的纠错能力，就是靠着他的天真，靠着他的那种就是天性的乐观，他有成功的纠错了。所以这个电影就是 1960 年拍出来的时候，是获了当年的就是奥斯卡的最佳影片。这个时候你再看看现在的电影，真的没法跟那个时候相比，就是无论精巧的成程度，还是他的思想的深刻性都是差很多很多。所以我们这个编剧故事营最后一次线下课跟大家一起欣赏这个电影。整个 12 堂课我们放了 12 部电影。哼就是基本上是个电影课。但是我是这样想的，如果是这个电影分成片段的话，就会丧失它的魅力。
- 电影其实是每一个镜头，每一个就是小的片段，其实它都有它的意义，每个场景都有它存在的价值。所以与其我们这个快进地去看十部电影，不如认真地去从头到尾看好一部电影。而这个喜剧的价值就在于此，它是在我们笑过之后可以多很多的思考，并且他把人生的这个没有价值的东西撕破给我们看，并且把更有价值的东西让我们去细细地品味在以后的生活中。去让把这个喜剧的精神在我们的生活中体现出了就是那种已经看破了世界的真相，但是依然去热爱它，依然去寻找希望的这样一种精神。又就又一句话说叫看破红尘补红尘的那种精神。这样在这个尤其是比利华尔德，他从东欧国家逃到美国，然后在美国这个一直拍这种喜剧片，它的喜剧片的价值就在于此，就是它会很反讽，但是在反讽的同时，它保留着对人性最深刻的那个就是人性中最单纯的部分的一种热爱。所以我们从这里边也可以看出电影的价值。那接下来我们就是剩下的实际剩下的时间，我们下个礼拜我们再上一次线上课，我把剩下的那个那本书的内容给大家讲解一下，那个到时候我们就结束了，但是线下课我们这是最后一堂，谢谢大家，我们以后有机会再见。
