- 1耶和华神所造的，惟有蛇比田野一切的活物更狡猾。蛇对女人说，神岂是真说，不许你们吃园中所有树上的果子吗？
- Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
- 2女人对蛇说，园中树上的果子，我们可以吃，
- And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
- 3惟有园当中那棵树上的果子，神曾说，你们不可吃，也不可摸，免得你们死。
- But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
- 4蛇对女人说，你们不一定死，
- And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die
- 5因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。
- For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
- 6于是女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了。又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。
- And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
- >  肉体的情欲，眼目的情欲，今生的骄傲。
- 7他们二人的眼睛就明亮了，才知道自己是赤身露体，便拿无花果树的叶子，为自己编作裙子。
- And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
- 8天起了凉风，耶和华神在园中行走。那人和他妻子听见神的声音，就藏在园里的树木中，躲避耶和华神的面。
- And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day
- 9耶和华神呼唤那人，对他说，你在哪里。
- And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?
- 10他说，我在园中听见你的声音，我就害怕。因为我赤身露体，我便藏了。
- And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
- 11耶和华说，谁告诉你赤身露体呢？莫非你吃了我吩咐你不可吃的那树上的果子吗？
- And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
- 12那人说，你所赐给我，与我同居的女人，她把那树上的果子给我，我就吃了。
- And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
- 13耶和华神对女人说，你作的是什么事呢？女人说，那蛇引诱我，我就吃了。
- And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
- 14耶和华神对蛇说，你既作了这事，就必受咒诅，比一切的牲畜野兽更甚。你必用肚子行走，终身吃土。
- And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
- 15我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇。你的后裔和女人的后裔也彼此为仇。女人的后裔要伤你的头，你要伤他的脚跟。
- And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
- 16又对女人说，我必多多加增你怀胎的苦楚，你生产儿女必多受苦楚。你必恋慕你丈夫，你丈夫必管辖你。
- Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
- 17又对亚当说，你既听从妻子的话，吃了我所吩咐你不可吃的那树上的果子，地必为你的缘故受咒诅。你必终身劳苦，才能从地里得吃的。
- And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it
- 18地必给你长出荆棘和蒺藜来，你也要吃田间的菜蔬。
- Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
- 19你必汗流满面才得糊口，直到你归了土，因为你是从土而出的。你本是尘土，仍要归于尘土。
- In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken
- 20亚当给他妻子起名叫夏娃，因为她是众生之母。
- And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
- 21耶和华神为亚当和他妻子用皮子作衣服给他们穿。
- Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
- 22耶和华神说，那人已经与我们相似，能知道善恶。现在恐怕他伸手又摘生命树的果子吃，就永远活着。
- And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil
- 23耶和华神便打发他出伊甸园去，耕种他所自出之土。
- Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
- 24于是把他赶出去了。又在伊甸园的东边安设基路伯和四面转动发火焰的剑，要把守生命树的道路。
- So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
