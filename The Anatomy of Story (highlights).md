    - Three-act structure is a mechanical device superimposed on the story and has nothing to do with its internal logic—where the story should or should not go. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=109))
    - A mechanical view of story, like three-act theory, inevitably leads to episodic storytelling. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=110))
    - The result: a hopelessly generic, formulaic story devoid of originality. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=117))
    - Good storytelling doesn’t just tell audiences what happened in a life. It gives them the experience of that life. It ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=142))
    - Stories are really giving the audience a form of knowledge—emotional knowledge—or what used to be known as wisdom, but they do it in a playful, entertaining way. As a creator of verbal ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=146))
    - Withholding, or hiding, information is crucial to the storyteller’s make-believe. It forces the audience to figure out who the character is and what he is doing and so draws the audience into the story. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=149))
    - Audiences love both the feeling part (reliving the life) and the thinking part (figuring out the puzzle) of a story. Every good story has both. ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=152))
    - Plays typically focus on the main character’s moment of decision. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=173))
    - Television drama shows a number of characters in a minisociety struggling to change ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=178))
    - The premise is your story stated in one sentence. It is the simplest combination of character and plot and typically consists of some event that starts the action, some sense of the main character, and some sense of the outcome of the story. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=295))
    - So producers look for a premise that is “high concept”—meaning that the film can be reduced to a catchy one-line description that audiences will understand instantly and come rushing to the theater to see. ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=305))
    - To explore yourself, to have a chance to write something that may change your life, you have to get some data on who you are. And you have to get it outside of you, in front of you, so you can study it from a distance. ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=344))
    - First, write down your wish list, a list of everything you would like to see up on the screen, in a book, or at the theater. It’s what you are passionately interested in, and it’s what entertains you. You might jot down characters you have imagined, cool plot twists, or great lines of dialogue that have popped into your head. You might list themes that you care about or ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=346))
    - The second exercise is to write a premise list. This is a list of every premise you’ve ever thought of. That might be five, twenty, fifty, or more. Again, take as many sheets of paper as you need. The key requirement of the exercise is that you express each premise in one sentence. This forces you to be very clear about each idea. And it allows you to see all your ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=350))
    - If you have given your hero a moral need, his self-revelation should be moral as well. The hero doesn’t just see himself in a new light; he has an insight about the proper way to act toward others. In ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=868))
    - To create great characters, think of all your characters as part of a web in which each helps define the others. To put it another way, a character is often defined by who he is not. ([Location 989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=989))
    - The most important step in creating your hero, as well as all other characters, is to connect and compare each to the others. ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=991))
    - [Brecht] pointed out that every actor has to serve the action of the play … . When [the actor] sees himself in relation to the wholeness of the play he will see that not only is too much characterizing (petty details) often opposed to the play’s needs but also that many unnecessary characteristics can actually work against him and make his own appearance less striking.1 ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=999))
    - Even though the audience is most interested in how the hero has changed, you can’t show them that change unless every character, including the hero, plays his assigned part on the team. Let’s look at the story function of the major kinds of characters in fiction. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=1003))
    - A simple rule of thumb in fiction is this: the smaller the range, the less interesting the story; the bigger the range, the more interesting but the riskier the story, because characters don’t change much in the limited time they appear in most stories. ([Location 1410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=1410))
    - Always begin at the end of the change, with the self-revelation; then go back and determine the starting point of the change, which is the hero’s need and desire; then figure out the steps of development in between. ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=1496))
    - Some writers are afraid of this technique because they think it constricts them or forces them to write schematically. In fact, this technique gives you greater freedom because you always have a safety net. No matter where you are in the story, you know your eventual destination. So you can take chances and try out story events that may appear on the surface to be off the path but are actually taking you in a more creative way to where you need to go. ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=1505))
    - It should be new information for the hero: he must see, for the first time, that he has been living a lie about himself and that he has hurt others. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=1512))
    - This creates a funnel effect and lets Tom bounce off one character and then another again and again over the course of the story. ([Location 4623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=4623))
    - In this technique, the story must take place in twenty-four hours, in one location, and must follow one action or story line. The ([Location 4633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=4633))
    - In effect, the twenty-two steps guarantee that your main character drives your plot. ([Location 4760](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=4760))
    - drive, which is the set of actions the hero takes to reach the goal, is primarily a plot step. ([Location 4762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=4762))
    - The average hit film in Hollywood today has seven to ten major reveals. Some ([Location 5062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=5062))
