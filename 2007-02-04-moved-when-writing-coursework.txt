昨夜作业收尾。这次写的题目是《一个报纸人之死：分析兰成长案与背后的中国新闻伦理问题》（Death of a Newspaper-man: Death of a Newspaper-man: Analysis on The Lan Chengzhang Murder Case and the Related Ethical Issues of Chinese Journalism ）。

这是我写得最仔细的一篇作业，参考了12本新闻伦理的书，20几篇学术论文，以及网上可以看到的大部分兰成长案的新闻。

文章最后是这么写的－－





<blockquote>Lan Chengzhang’s death has enabled a lot of Chinese to see the dark side of the media system and society. Thus, the bottle of secrets has been opened. Currently, hot debates concerning social justice, media reforms and journalistic ethics are still underway. On Netease, a Chinese news portal, the majority of internet users are condemning the murderers and the disheartened officials, and appealing for more journalists to meet the public’s expectation by chasing truth and justice. Although the Lan case is still waiting for a trial. All believe that Lan should not die in vain. </blockquote>



写到这里，我感觉自己眼圈发红，于是又写到－－





<blockquote>Wang Keqin, a courageous journalist, who has received death thread for several times, wrote a series of report about Lan’s death. On his blog, he posted a photograph of Lan’s daughter. Holding his father’s portrait, the little girl lifted her misty eyes. What is ethics? Why we need ethics? How can a Chinese journalist do something to improve his ethics? The little girl’s eyes have explained all. </blockquote>



最后把那张照片也一起贴上了。冷静下来，觉得不够理性，又把照片去掉了。

这篇文章从新闻体制、媒体生存环境、新闻伦理现状等方面分析了兰成长之死的根源所在。以呼唤新闻立法，呼吁自我约束结尾。

欢迎达人们指正。
