        - 长期持有，经受得起风险。
    - 卖出和持有btc的理由
        - If you own Bitcoin and are wondering about the benefits of selling it, some of the reasons are as follows:
        - 如果你拥有比特币，并且在考虑出售它的好处，以下是一些原因：
        - ____**1**
        - **Cheap Money Time is Over.** The FED (Federal Reserve System) interest rates have recently been hiked. Although you would expect the FED to affect stock more, we must remember that the stock and cryptocurrency markets have always been related. So it makes sense that FED policies will affect the price of crypto. This hike is intended to try and control the out-of-control inflation we have been seeing in global markets. So, as investors navigate the uncertain economic waters, several markets are struggling. Crypto included.
        - 便宜的货币时代已经结束。美联储最近提高了利率。尽管你可能认为美联储会更多地影响股市，但我们必须记住，股票市场和加密货币市场一直存在关联。因此，美联储的政策将影响加密货币的价格是合理的。这次加息旨在试图控制我们在全球市场中看到的失控通货膨胀。因此，随着投资者在不确定的经济环境中航行，一些市场正在挣扎，包括加密货币市场。
        - ____**2**
        - **Groupthink Dangers:** Since Bitcoin was the first-ever crypto and also one which has made many people lots of money, many people bought into it by default. Nevertheless, this does not mean that it will stand the test of time. It is entirely possible for Bitcoin to tank once people lose interest in it or simply move on to other financial products.
        - 集体思维的危险：由于比特币是第一个加密货币，也是让许多人赚了很多钱的加密货币，许多人默认地购买了它。然而，这并不意味着它将经得起时间的考验。比特币完全有可能在人们失去兴趣或简单地转向其他金融产品时崩盘。
        - ____**3**
        - **Other Options:** Although Bitcoin has had much success in the past, it is far from the only crypto on the market. Therefore, investing in newer products can be a way actually to make a gainful investment. This means that you may want to exchange your BTC for other crypto products.
        - 其他选择：尽管比特币过去取得了很大成功，但市场上并不只有它一种加密货币。因此，投资于新产品实际上可能是一种有利可图的投资方式。这意味着您可能希望将您的比特币兑换成其他加密货币产品。
        - ____**4**
        - **Lack of Regulations:** Lastly, the lack of regulations makes BTC a major wild card. Although there have been rumors of widespread regulations, it has yet to occur. No matter what kind of crypto you invest in, you will have to deal with a high level of [volatility](https://tradersunion.com/interesting-articles/what-is-volatility-and-how-to-use-it/).
        - 缺乏监管：最后，缺乏监管使得比特币成为一个主要的不确定因素。尽管有关广泛监管的传言，但尚未发生。无论您投资于何种加密货币，都将不得不应对高水平的波动性。
        - ## ____Top Reasons to Hold Bitcoin
            - 持有比特币的顶级原因
        - ### The price has corrected significantly
            - 价格已经大幅调整
            - Bitcoin is currently trading at a discount of nearly 66% from its all-time high. While this fall might seem like a crash for majority of assets classes, it is just another routine correction when it comes to [cryptocurrencies](https://tradersunion.com/interesting-articles/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-whether-it-is-worth-buying-it/). A general rule of thumb investors adhere to is the buying-the-dip methodology where an asset is accumulated during its correction. So given the distance from the peak for Bitcoin’s price currently, experts believe that its price has higher chances to find a support somewhere around the current levels, representing a buying opportunity.
            - 比特币目前以接近 66%的折扣价交易，距离其历史最高价。虽然这种下跌对于大多数资产类别来说可能看起来像是一场崩盘，但对于加密货币来说，这只是另一次例行修正。投资者遵循的一个经验法则是购买低点的方法论，在资产修正期间积累资产。因此，鉴于比特币当前价格与峰值之间的距离，专家们认为其价格更有可能在当前水平附近找到支撑，代表了一个购买机会。
        - ### Institutional Adoption 机构采用
            - When Bitcoin was first launched, all market participants were highly skeptical about its adoption. But slowly and gradually, people are now accepting the innovation and utilizing it for their own operational requirements. In fact, many investment firms and funds now have a portfolio dedicated primarily to cryptocurrencies, majority of which have Bitcoin as the most heavily weighted constituent. This adds a lot of attention and reliability to the crypto’s name as retail investors generally act upon the advisory of these firms.
            - 当比特币首次推出时，所有市场参与者对其采用都持高度怀疑态度。但慢慢地，人们现在接受这种创新，并将其用于自己的运营需求。事实上，许多投资公司和基金现在都有一个专门用于加密货币的投资组合，其中大多数以比特币作为最重要的成分。这为加密货币的名声增添了很多关注和可靠性，因为零售投资者通常会根据这些公司的建议行事。
        - ### Lightning network success
            - 闪电网络成功
            - The Bitcoin network can process nearly 4.6 transactions per second. While this might be slower compared to the likes of Visa, it does get ahead when it comes to the transaction costs involved. As per blockchain.com, the average fees per transaction (in USD) for Bitcoin currently is approximately $1.43, while the same for Visa can go as high as 3.55% of the transaction amount + a $0.10 flat fee. This has led to a considerable migration of users to the crypto platform for transaction facilitation.
            - 比特币网络每秒可以处理近 4.6 笔交易。虽然与 Visa 等公司相比可能较慢，但在涉及交易成本时却领先。根据 blockchain.com 的数据，比特币目前每笔交易的平均费用（以美元计）约为 1.43 美元，而 Visa 的费用可能高达交易金额的 3.55% + 0.10 美元的固定费用。这导致大量用户转移到加密平台进行交易 facilitation。
        - ### Bitcoin has store value
            - 比特币具有储值功能
            - The maximum supply of Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million coins. This means that beyond this point, Bitcoin will provide store value given its limited supply. To understand this better, take the example of gold, which obviously has a limited supply available. In order to store the value of fiat money, investors generally invest their money in gold, which in turn preserves value against factors like inflation. Experts believe that Bitcoin as an investment borrows some of its behavior from gold, having similar characteristics like limited supply and store value, and so many also call it “digital gold.”
            - 比特币的最大供应量固定在 2100 万枚。这意味着在这一点之后，由于供应有限，比特币将提供储值功能。为了更好地理解这一点，可以以黄金为例，显然黄金的供应是有限的。为了储存法定货币的价值，投资者通常会将资金投资于黄金，从而抵御通货膨胀等因素。专家认为，比特币作为一种投资，借鉴了黄金的一些特性，具有类似的供应限制和储值功能，因此许多人也称其为“数字黄金”。
        - ### The halving cycle makes bitcoin scarce
            - 减半周期使比特币稀缺
            - Let’s first understand what does the halving cycle mean. In order to mine Bitcoin, the miners solve complex computer equations. For solving such equations successfully, they are rewarded with blocks of Bitcoin, and each block contains a fixed amount of bitcoin (6.25 BTC per block currently.) For every 210,000th block mined, the number of bitcoins awarded per block gets halved. So by the next halving cycle (predicted to take place in 2024), miners would only get 3.25 BTC per block, reducing the supply of Bitcoin in the market. And as the basic laws of economics suggest, lower supply, with even stable demand (if not higher,) leads to a higher price.
            - 让我们首先了解减半周期意味着什么。为了挖掘比特币，矿工们需要解决复杂的计算机方程式。成功解决这些方程式后，他们将获得比特币区块作为奖励，每个区块包含固定数量的比特币（目前每个区块为 6.25 BTC）。每挖掘 21 万个区块，每个区块奖励的比特币数量就会减半。因此，在下一个减半周期（预计将于 2024 年发生）中，矿工每个区块只能获得 3.25 BTC，从而减少市场上的比特币供应。正如经济学的基本法则所示，供应减少，即使需求保持稳定（甚至更高），也会导致价格上涨。
        - ### The bitcoin bull cycle theory
            - 比特币牛市周期理论
            - As with any other asset, analysts believe that the price of Bitcoin too moves in cycles. It is said that every Bitcoin bull run is followed by a crypto winter, where the price of the currency falls anywhere between 60-80%, but not significantly breaching the previous cycle high. The same cycle has taken place currently with Bitcoin sustaining the sub-$17,000 levels and bouncing back from there. If this theory is deemed to be correct, then the next bull run might not be far.
            - 与任何其他资产一样，分析师们认为比特币的价格也会呈周期性变动。据说每次比特币牛市之后都会出现加密冬季，这时货币价格会下跌 60-80%，但不会显著突破前一个周期的高点。目前比特币正经历着相同的周期，维持在低于 17,000 美元的水平并从那里反弹。如果这一理论被认为是正确的，那么下一次牛市可能不会远了。
        - ### Bitcoin is the benchmark for cryptocurrencies
            - 比特币是加密货币的基准
            - While this might sound ironic, Bitcoin is actually stable relative to the other cryptocurrencies (excluding the currency-pegged stable-coins.) And as it is also the primary crypto, experts often see it as the benchmark for comparison for [alternative coins](https://tradersunion.com/interesting-articles/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-whether-it-is-worth-buying-it/altcoins-and-their-types/). This adds a lot of trust and following behind its name.
            - 尽管这听起来有些讽刺，但相对于其他加密货币（不包括与货币挂钩的稳定币），比特币实际上是相对稳定的。由于它也是主要的加密货币，专家们经常将其视为替代币种比较的基准。这为其名声增添了许多信任和追随者。
