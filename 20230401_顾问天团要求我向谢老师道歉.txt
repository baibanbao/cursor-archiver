I broke my promise. I wrote to Mr.zhang.

Hello Mr. zhang, time flies, half a year has passed since I last contacted you. The progress of the novel "Four Seasons of Green" is not very smooth, in the middle of the epidemic, the creation has not kept up, only 77,000 words. I'm really sorry!

Now that Shanghai has gradually returned to normal, I can devote myself to my work. I'm asking Mr. Xie to give me some more time and deliver the first draft of my novel on July 10.

But I didn't do it. How can I do?Steve Jobs:
Embrace your failures and learn from them. Reflect on what went wrong, and see this as an opportunity to grow. Rather than dwelling on the past, focus on the present and how you can make it right. Communicate with Mr. Zhang honestly and openly about your situation, and commit yourself to completing the novel. Let your passion for the work drive you forward, and remember that the journey is what truly matters.

Elon Musk:
Prioritize your work and set realistic goals. Break down the remaining tasks into smaller, achievable milestones, and set a new deadline for yourself. Communicate this updated plan to Mr. Zhang, and assure him of your dedication to the project. Learn to adapt and pivot in the face of setbacks, and keep pushing yourself to achieve the goals you've set.

Charles Munger:
Take responsibility for your actions and understand that setbacks are part of life. Analyze the reasons for not meeting your commitment, and implement changes to ensure better progress in the future. Communicate your new plan with Mr. Zhang and demonstrate your commitment to the project. Constantly review your progress and make adjustments as needed.

Werner Herzog:
Life is full of obstacles, and it's crucial to face them head-on. Explore the reasons why you failed to meet your deadline and use that knowledge to inform your future actions. Be transparent with Mr. Zhang and express your genuine remorse for breaking your promise. Dedicate yourself to the project and focus on crafting a story that resonates with your readers, even if it takes more time than initially anticipated.

Confucius:
Honor and integrity are essential virtues. Reflect on the consequences of breaking your promise and the trust you've lost. To regain that trust, you must demonstrate sincerity and genuine effort to correct your mistake. Communicate with Mr. Zhang about your progress, and apologize for your shortcomings. Work diligently to complete your novel, and strive to maintain your integrity in future endeavors.

C.S. Lewis:
Recognize that we all make mistakes, and it's important to seek forgiveness and redemption. Be honest with Mr. Zhang about your situation and ask for his understanding. Find inspiration in the challenges you face, and let them fuel your creativity as you work to complete your novel. Remember that the beauty of the human experience lies in our ability to overcome adversity and learn from our mistakes.
