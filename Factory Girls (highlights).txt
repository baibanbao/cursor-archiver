    - You never asked her name. ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=68))
    - That was a fact of factory life you couldn’t know from the outside: Getting into a factory was easy. The hard part was getting out. ([Location 86](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=86))
    - In ten months on the assembly line, Min had sent home three thousand yuan—about $360—and made two true friends. She should have been scared. But all she knew was that she was free. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=147))
    - To come out from home and work in a factory is the hardest thing they have ever done. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=190))
    - Migrants are the rural elite. They are younger, better educated, and more enterprising than the people they leave behind. The city people’s name for them—liudong renkou, floating population—suggests an aimless mob, but most migrants leave home with a work objective in mind, in the company of a relative or fellow villager who already knows the way. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=192))
    - Thus Min would return over and over to this day, trying to unravel the mystery of the moment when her luck changed. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=226))
    - In traditional China, calligraphy was the mark of an educated person. Good calligraphy showed refinement and literary accomplishment; calligraphy could also reveal the subtle weaknesses in a person’s character. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=229))
    - My only worry was that she might be too settled—with a stable office job in hand, perhaps the great dramas of her life were already past. But I needn’t have worried about that. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=257))
    - Long journeys end at the Guangzhou railway station, ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=266))
    - Up a steep ramp and across an overpass is the long-distance bus station, where the express to Dongguan, ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=271))
    - The bus slows for the Dongguan exit, and now the factories appear up close. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=283))
    - The best way to understand the city of Dongguan is to walk it. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=287))
    - The roads are wide and well paved but there are no pedestrian lights or crosswalks. This is a city built for machines, not people. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=290))
    - On weekends, teenagers take over Dongguan, giving its parks and squares the feel of an open-air high school. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=321))
    - nonchalant. On Monday mornings, the parks and the squares of Dongguan are eerily empty. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=324))
    - At night, the factories lining the highways are lit. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=326))
    - I wanted to write about something else—how the workers themselves thought about migration. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=376))
    - I came to like Dongguan, which seemed a perverse expression of China at its most extreme. Materialism, environmental ruin, corruption, traffic, pollution, noise, prostitution, bad driving, short-term thinking, stress, striving, and chaos: If you could make it here, you’d make it anywhere. I ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=416))
    - I was invisible in Dongguan, and I liked that too. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=419))
    - Dongguan is invisible to the outside world. Most of my friends in Beijing had passed through the city but all they remembered—with a shudder—were the endless factories and the prostitutes. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=422))
    - Dongguan was a place without memory. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=426))
    - though their products have gotten more sophisticated, the work itself has not. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=457))
    - We already disliked each other. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=477))
    - She worked the night shift at a hotel, doing sales. I wondered what kind of sales had to be done between midnight and six o’clock in the morning, but I never found the courage to ask. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=500))
    - things were happening too quickly to be written down. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=539))
    - I thought of all the young women I knew who lived here, and how every single one had been cheated, abused, and yelled at by someone just like the skinny Cantonese man, who probably woke up in the morning already angry at the world. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=573))
    - Chinese history museums are troubled places. Ancient civilization was great, or so the official narrative went, but it was feudal and backward. Modern China was ravaged by foreigners, but the Chinese people were heroic in humiliation and defeat. China stood up in 1949 when the Communists came to power, but there were other years since—1957, 1966, and 1989 in particular—that went prominently unmentioned. Everything that was jumbled and incoherent and better left unsaid must be smoothed into a rational pattern, because the purpose of history from the time of Confucius has been to transmit moral lessons to later generations. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=584))
    - two fake ducks. The continuous loop quacked. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=596))
    - The only authentic artifacts in the Dongguan museum were the piles of rocks. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=600))
    - Soon the huge lobby was deserted, and I was left alone to ponder the unlikelihood of a Chinese history museum that did not make a single mention of Mao Zedong. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=633))
    - Guangdong in 1993 was even more chaotic than it is today. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=652))
    - Time was Chunming’s enemy, reminding her that another day had passed and she had not yet achieved her goals. But time was also her friend, because she was still young. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=704))
    - Unlike men, women had no home to go back to. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=808))
    - If migration liberated young women from the village, it also dropped them in a no-man’s-land. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=815))
    - stride—over three years in Dongguan, I never heard a single person express anything like a feminist sentiment. ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=821))
    - She observed that when the head of the human resources department gave a speech, he was so nervous that his hands trembled. Around the new year holiday, a manager on the factory floor ignored her until she boldly wished him a happy new year; he responded warmly and gave her ten yuan in a red envelope, a traditional gift. From this incident, I understand: Some people who have always seemed unapproachable may not really be so. You just need to make yourself a little more approachable. ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=838))
    - They did not preach about laws that must be amended or behaviors that must be improved, and they never mentioned ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=915))
    - The network-sales model was ideally suited to a Chinese society in which traditional morality had broken down and only the harshest rules—trust no one, make money fast—still applied. ([Location 958](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=958))
    - In traditional China, the art of oratory was not an important skill—to write an elegant essay in beautiful calligraphy was what mattered—and speeches in China have always been dismal affairs. Speakers often read directly from a script, and the script is usually tedious. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=972))
    - to visit old friends required new clothes. ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1059))
    - In an unforgiving city, the Dongguan talent market was the toughest place of all. ([Location 1272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1272))
    - Height was a universal Chinese obsession. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1290))
    - In the migrant world, the mobile phone was a metaphor for the relentless pace of city life. ([Location 1369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1369))
    - That was the short-term mentality of Dongguan: Save a few pennies, even if it meant losing touch with some people for good. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1377))
    - Upward mobility is possible; the demands of production are so intense that Yue Yuen must promote from within. ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1421))
    - Provincial stereotypes color hiring, and a boss can ban an entire province if he believes that a hundred million people from one place can share a personality trait. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1430))
    - There is no longer any shame attached to migration. The shame now lies in staying home. ([Location 1496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1496))
    - It is the seasons of the factory, rather than the fields, that define migrant life now. ([Location 1499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1499))
    - now. Songs about the migrant experience are no longer heard in the factory cities of the south; the workers on the assembly line now listen to the same pop tunes as urban teenagers. ([Location 1501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1501))
    - From their homes in the village, families tried to influence their daughters. Send money home. Don’t get a boyfriend outside. Get married sooner. Come back. For the most part the girls did as they pleased. ([Location 1557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1557))
    - Migrants learned quickly how to deal with their parents: They disobeyed, they fought, and they lied. ([Location 1703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=1703))
    - But if the national curriculum was irrelevant, commercial schools thrived in the city. ([Location 2410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=2410))
    - “Hunan,” she said—and there the conversation died, because there was no good answer to that. ([Location 3920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=3920))
    - Electricity was used sparingly to save money, and most dinners were eaten in near-darkness. ([Location 3930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=3930))
    - That was all: no introductions, no conversation, just cigarettes—the calling cards and currency of the Chinese male universe. ([Location 4049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4049))
    - Being considerate of others was not the village way: People spent all their time in groups, so they were good at ignoring one another. ([Location 4059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4059))
    - The focus of village life was television. The children sat in front of the set all day; ([Location 4070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4070))
    - The young migrants dominated the holiday life of the village, enjoying the authority their money gave them. They went around showing off their mobile phones and new clothes; they compared job situations. They were the most active matchmakers, for themselves and for one another, and they gave cash to needy older relatives. In the past, such tasks had belonged to their elders, but now the older generation was too poor and powerless to fulfill these duties. Parents were left with little to do but gossip about their children’s earnings and marriage prospects. ([Location 4100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4100))
    - FOR ME, the hardest thing about staying in Min’s village was the collective way of life. No one was ever alone. ([Location 4106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4106))
    - Spending time in Min’s village, I understood why migrants felt so alone when they first went to the city. But I also saw how they came to value the freedom they found there, until at last they were unable to live without it. ([Location 4121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4121))
    - Nobody could remember the meaning of this tradition, but it was followed just the same. ([Location 4142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4142))
    - As the factories of Dongguan came into view through the bus window, she looked at one after another without saying anything. “Home is good,” she said at last, “but you can only stay a few days.” ([Location 4253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4253))
    - These were some of the rules of doing business in China: Never plan ahead. Never turn off your mobile phone. Never be on time. ([Location 4801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=4801))
    - In a world where almost everyone worked nonstop, Chinese officials enjoyed two-hour breaks for lunch and a long nap. When Chunming stopped by one office to ask a quick question, the guard at the gate looked offended. “They are still sleeping.” ([Location 5008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=5008))
    - She monitored her father’s purchases and rejected his business plans, and the fact that she had sent home $1,300 gave her such authority. ([Location 5224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=5224))
    - first. This was an evangelical appeal, with one difference: If you came late in life to Jesus, you could still be saved. But if you delayed joining direct sales, you would lose out financially to everyone who built their networks before you. ([Location 5534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=5534))
    - Successful or not, migration changes fates. Studies of recent migrants suggest that most of them are not destined to return to the farm. The ([Location 5685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001FA0URC&location=5685))
