ji[#3) STORYTELLING: The Power of Specifics | The Benshi](http://thebenshi.com/?p=95)

> I remember reading long, long ago one of Joseph Wambaugh‘s early non-fiction crime books about a serial killer around Philadelphia. The man had managed to assume several false identities and did an impressive job of deceiving people.  The thing that Wambaugh mentioned repeatedly throughout the book was that the most common comment from the people who were taken in by the killer’s deceptions was that “his stories were so specific.”

说的是一个费城历史上出过一个连环杀手，最擅长伪造身份骗人。所有被他骗过的幸存者都说：“他讲的故事太具体了。”

我们常说“编得有鼻子有眼”，就是指具体而微的故事。只要讲一个specific（明确，具体，确定）的故事，就可以欺骗善良的人们，何况观众。

其实观众走进剧院和电影院，心里早就怀着一个念头：欺骗我，但是要用高超的技巧。
