瑞典Peter Bjorn And John乐队的一首歌Young Forks，欢快的节奏背后，听得出一种苍凉。

试着翻译一下歌词的高潮部分。

我们不在乎小年轻，乳臭未干的调调；
我们不在乎老伙计，老气横秋那一套。
我们不在乎人之过，只弹自己的曲调，
我们只在乎你和我，恋人絮语的唠叨。



If i told you things i did before
told you how i used to be
would you go along with someone like me

if you knew my story word for word
had all of my history
would you go along with someone like me

i did before and had my share
it didn't lead nowhere
i would go along with someone like you

it doesn't matter what you did
who you were hanging with
we could stick around and see this night through

*Repeat
and we don't care about the young folks
talkin' bout the young style
and we don't care about the old folks
talkin' 'bout the old style too
and we don't care about their own faults
talkin' 'bout our own style
all we care 'bout is talking
talking only me and you 

usually when things has gone this far
people tend to disappear
no-one will surprise me unless you do

i can tell there's something goin' on
hours seems to disappear
everyone is leaving i'm still with you

it doesn't matter what we do
where we are going to
we can stick around and see this night through
