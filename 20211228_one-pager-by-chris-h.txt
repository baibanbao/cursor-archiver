Chris Hadfield

Training and Learning: One-Pagers

Preparing for space travel means learning massive amounts of information. Learn how Chris used a series of one-page summaries to recall complex systems and concepts on the fly during his time in space.

CHAPTER REVIEW

To be successful as an astronaut, you must learn how to managea sometimes overwhelming amount of information. Chris processes information pertaining to complex systems by learning the totality of the information and then methodically breaking it down into one-page summaries. Chris used this technique as a test pilot and each time he went to space: he distilled the most complex information he needed to know for a flight into a personal flight manual, made up of one-pagers that focused on his personal interface with the task, tool, or system at hand. Condensing and sorting information in your mind to make a one-pager helps it become less overwhelming. A quick scan of the page just before doing the task reminds you of what you learned, now that you actually need it.
