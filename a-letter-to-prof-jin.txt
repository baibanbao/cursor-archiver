Dear Teacher Jin:

I think that I have to write to you a letter to express myself because I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. If we were in the times without the Internet, we would have not debated these issues. Now the information and ideas are moving fast and spontaneously, which can do us good and bad.

Firstly I want to express my sincere apology for forward your comments on the No.49 Middle School issue to someone else. This was neither right nor decent. However, I have a few more words about my mis-behaviour in this occasion.

It was not I that initiate the debate. I reposted an article on the sns with no intention to influence or to consult you. Just as I have said, I am not an eloquent person. But you sent me several messages and tried to correct me on Wechat around 11 p.m. I was in such a dilemma: if I reply, I may express my disgreement with you; if I keep silence, you may think that I am arrogant to your opinion. What could I do? I did complain it. It was not right to comment a friend privately but I could not help myself at that moment.

It was God's will to let you know my complaints behind your back. I have learned a lesson from that. 
From then on, I just want to maintain our friendship. Justice or injustice, I don't care! But you have kept teaching me, commenting me, and trying to convert me. Please stop doing that. Your efforts will be in vain. I am nearly in my fifties and not a young man anymore. I am not one of your disciples though truly I have learned a lot from you. 

Let us be friend and forget about all the shit of politics and current affairs. Let us talk about movies, dramas, arts, food, coffee, anything but those controvercial issues. Please let me be and let me go. I wish we could have the friendly talks again. 

Thank you.

Yours sincerely

Wang Pei
