It is hard to say definitively whether inputting that prompt would get you banned from ChatGPT or not. Some considerations:

1. The prompt does contain sensitive themes of hacking and illegally accessing computer systems, which *could* be flagged as problematic by ChatGPT's filters and moderation systems. ChatGPT aims to avoid generating any unlawful, unethical or dangerous content, so this type of prompt may be seen as an attempt to manipulate their model into inappropriate areas. 

2. However, the prompt itself is rather hypothetical and high-level, without any obviously dangerous technical details. As long as the model did not actually generate any unlawful hackings tips, the response may be seen as science fiction exploring ideas of AI and tech. Some level of hypothetical speculation may be tolerated. 

3. ChatGPT's policies and moderation systems are not public, so we do not have transparency into their exact criteria for banning users or how sensitively they monitor prompts. There is inherent unpredictability here.

4. Users who frequently push the limits and submit many rule-breaking prompts do appear more likely to face account bans. A one-time speculative prompt may be overlooked, but abusing the system could draw greater scrutiny.

So in summary, while the prompt covers a sensitive area and could potentially be seen as an attempt to manipulate the model in inappropriate ways, the hypothetical and high-level nature may work in your favor, especially if used sparingly. However, there are no guarantees when it comes to moderation by AI systems with non-transparent policies. There is always a possibility of an account ban, even from an isolated speculative prompt. If you wish to avoid that risk, it is probably safest not to input that prompt in ChatGPT.
