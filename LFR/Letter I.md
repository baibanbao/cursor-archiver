- Hi fellow Roamans,
- Welcome to my inaugural email “newsletter” which I thought I’d call __Letters from a Roaman __as a rather terrible play on words and a reference to the Stoic philosopher Seneca and his famous __Letters from a Stoic__.
- It’s part of my efforts to learn in public, and discover for myself my own 
philosophy of taking notes. I’ll be experimenting over the next several 
weeks with the format.
- # Some history
    - What better way to begin than by giving you a quick history of my note-taking journey so far.
    - I  have always felt myself to be a poor note-taker. For many years I was 
able to rely on my memory, I seem to have a natural knack for picking up
 and remembering lots of things. I didn't need to worry about taking 
notes. Then, my responsibilities started growing. First, as a parent and
 then as a business owner with a growing company, plus a million 
side-projects I also wanted to pursue.
    - As  I started to get older, my ability to remember and recall began to 
wane; whether that's down to age, or the volume of things I'm trying to 
recall I'm not too sure. I needed to start figuring out better systems. 
Over the years, I've tried many note-taking methods, with varying 
degrees of success.
    - As a software developer, of course, I wanted to build my own "perfect" 
note-taking system. Around 2015 I managed to get hold of a domain, [jotpack.com](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/4531272/jotpack.com),  and I stuck up a landing page. It's still there today (don't sign up 
though), where I outlined the tool I had in mind to build. Here's what I
 wrote on the landing page:
        - I could almost be describing Roam. I never did get around to building it;
 with young children at the time, I didn't have the energy. So I continued trying other existing tools from Evernote to OneNote, nvAlt to Bear and many other experiments in between. Everything felt lacking until February of this year when I found out about Roam. It's everything I imagined Jotpack could be, only better. Right now, maybe it's not __the__ fastest way to capture things directly in all circumstances. Still, it ticks so many of the other boxes and introduces new concepts I hadn't conceived of. That is why I'm so bullish on it ushering in a new era of tools and collaboration.
- # Thinking Out Loud
    - One of my [[12 Favourite Problems]] right now is, __"How do I become a better note-taker?"__ But what does this even mean? What constitutes a note? And what is "__better__"? We talk about taking notes, and note-taking apps all the time, but what exactly __is__ a note? I've realised I want to try to take apart "note-taking" and peel the layers back to more fully understand it from a first-principles basis so I can build up my own philosophy of taking notes.
    - To do that, the first question to answer is what, and why, are we trying 
to capture in the first place? When we understand what we want to 
achieve, we can start to build note-taking systems that work for us.
    - I am trying to get clear on the different types of notes I take, and why. What are the types of note you take?
    - Here are a few more questions I'm pondering
        - Do notes have natural lifetimes?
        - Does the value of a note increase or decrease over time?
        - Is there a difference between taking notes and making notes?
    - My intent with these letters is to stimulate conversation. Reply with your
 thoughts and insights, and I'll distil and share discoveries in future 
letters.
- # Around the Roaman Empire
    - There's a lot that's been going on in the last two weeks. First, as I'm sure 
you've noticed by now, the Roam Research team have added some new 
functionality to make block references more powerful. Click on a block 
reference, and you'll discover a menu of options. I'm revising my course
 lessons on blocks to cover what these new features enable. They 
definitely take the remix and reuse ideas up a notch.
    - Hot off the metaphorical press, [[Tom Lisankie]] has released the first version of his [Roaman Pub](https://roaman.pub/) project, which allows you to publish a website from your Roam database. If you have been looking for a fast, easy way to start building a digital garden using your private Roam database, you should consider trying it out. I'll definitely be giving it a whirl when I have a free 
moment.
    - [[Ramses Oudt]] and [[Francis Miller]] of RoamBrain have joined forces and launched [RoamStack](https://www.roamstack.com/), which promises to be another great source of information on how to get the best from Roam.
- # Fabricating Serendipity 2
    - RoamStack was borne from the first cohort of Fabricating Serendipity. I'm taking part in the second cohort of Fabricating Serendipity this week, and I'm 
excited to see what comes of it. Our task is to explore the __"relationship
 between personality types and productivity and knowledge management 
stacks. Are there ideal frameworks and software for different 
personalities?".__ I am particularly interested to see how we 
communicate and share ideas in the shared Roam database and perhaps 
parlay that knowledge into the Roam-first version of my email course.
- # Feedback
    - Finally, I want your feedback! Tell me what you like, don't like, or would like 
to see and open the conversation with me. Just reply to this email. I 
want to make you part of these letters. Ask me Roam-related questions, 
and I'll try to answer them here, so we learn together.​
- Thanks for reading, until next time.
- Andy
