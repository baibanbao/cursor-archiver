    - ### Roaman Aesthetics and a celebration of [[CatoMinor]]
        - I haven't talked much about the amazing work of [@CatoMinor3](twitter.com/catominor3) and how he's been pushing the envelope of CSS in Roam. Here's just a few examples:
        - **Improving Indentation**
            - https://twitter.com/CatoMinor3/status/1333848958750298114?s=20
                - When you fully utilise the power of indentation, it can sometimes be confusing as to where you are. I added this the moment I saw it. Having a nice, subtle indicator of where I am in the nested blocks structure is a godsend.
            - While we're on the subject of coloured indentation, it would be remiss of me not to mention [[Abhay Prasanna]]'s [rainbow indentation styling](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/blob/master/rainbow-indent.css):

        - **Flashcards**
            - This is hot off the press today, where CatoMinor demonstrates how he's turning Roam into a more complete flashcard solution! I can't wait to see this when it's done.
                - https://twitter.com/CatoMinor3/status/1336227290255159296?s=20
        - **Blockquotes**
            - Since the beginning of Roam, one of the biggest missing features has been the ability to use blockquotes natively to help differentiate between what you write yourself and the words of others that you've pulled in or are quoting.
            - Last week, Cato [released an article](https://catominor3.medium.com/in-the-search-for-missing-blockquotes-in-roam-5-reasonable-solutions-ddcd99127cca) detailing several methods you can use to solve it. Within hours, with a little push from CortexFutura, Bardia pushed an update to Roam which __finally__ gives us the feature we've been waiting for.
                - https://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1334820290187161603
            - All you need to do now is begin your block with `> ` as you would do with normal markdown style syntax and when you leave the block it'll be rendered as a natural block quote style. There are some hooks for your [[roam/css]] to enable you to customise how they look further.
            - As another small bonus, if you have a block containing just `---`, Roam will convert that to a visual horizontal line separator. No need to use the hiccup syntax any more! `:hiccup [:hr]`
            - https://twitter.com/CatoMinor3/status/1334764868113735680
        - If you're interested, it's worth following [@CatoMinor3](twitter.com/catominor3) on Twitter and [reading his articles on Medium](https://catominor3.medium.com/). You'll discover experiments with icons, tooltips, and his RoamExt extension, amongst many others. There are many members of #RoamCult who spend a lot of time making the lives of the rest of us easier. If you're willing and able to support his work either via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/catominor) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/catominor3) I am sure it will ensure he continues to innovate in Roam.
    - ### Roam Book Club
        - This iteration of the [[Roam Book Club]] is almost over, in a great session with [[Sönke Ahrens]] on Sunday we reflected on the experiment and the experience of implementing a zettelkasten in Roam and explored the frontiers of collaborating on a large scale in a shared Roam graph. Next Sunday will be the final call for this book but I hope it won't be the end. [[Matt McKinlay]] is now full-time at Roam so I hope that means there'll be plenty more Roam Book Clubs in the future. If you haven't joined in yet, I highly recommend it. You get to meet an international, diverse group of amazing people.
        - I plan to write a more complete roundup in [[LFR/Letter IX]].
    - ### Roam Hangouts
        - Violeta of Roam Research has started holding a Roam Hangout of sorts. The inaugural one featured [[Roamhacker]] where he demonstrated the new SmartBlocks feature of Roam42 (more below). As he was demonstrating I noticed a little detail that makes daily notes pages a little nicer - showing the day underneath the title.
            - ![Showing the day under page titles](http://share.foxsoft.co.uk/54vAjk+)
    - Chris was kind enough to [share his little add-on](https://gist.github.com/roamhacker/689270044dcf74257956a289131738c9) so you can enjoy the same benefits. Roam42 is a pre-requisite.

- ## Thinking Out Loud
    - ### SmartBlocks
        - SmartBlocks, for those not present during the Roam hangout on [[November 27th, 2020]], is the latest addition to Roam42 (currently in the testers build). It can be likened to the text expansion features of applications like TextExpander, Alfred and Text Blaze, the difference is that you can create these templates directly in Roam. BUT, they can be far more than just static templates. SmartBlocks provide commands, which means that you can build far more dynamic templates and complete workflows. It really is the start of Roam becoming the Excel equivalent for text.
            - > Last week, [RoamHacker](https://cwhitesullivan.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ0d2l0dGVyLmNvbSUyRnJvYW1oYWNrZXI=&a=66602312&account=cwhitesullivan%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=i%2BMM4awnuAf0TZt8s4ZNwk5Xw8IcJbZJCEP4X9vwpSQ%3D&s=ae8b3e9ead8f16073b34baf2606a7524&i=166A1021A1A862) showed us some features from the future with his unbelievable SmartBlocks extension. Our CEO [Conor](https://cwhitesullivan.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ0d2l0dGVyLmNvbSUyRkNvbmF3&a=66602312&account=cwhitesullivan%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=i%2BMM4awnuAf0TZt8s4ZNwk5Xw8IcJbZJCEP4X9vwpSQ%3D&s=ae8b3e9ead8f16073b34baf2606a7524&i=166A1021A1A863) even dropped by to see it with his own eyes. Here's [a short clip](https://cwhitesullivan.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20lMkZ3YXRjaCUzRnYlM0RtbENpTzJvSUYycyUyNnQlM0Qxcw==&a=66602312&account=cwhitesullivan%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=i%2BMM4awnuAf0TZt8s4ZNwk5Xw8IcJbZJCEP4X9vwpSQ%3D&s=ae8b3e9ead8f16073b34baf2606a7524&i=166A1021A1A864) from the session where Conor answers RoamHacker's one burning question about Roam.
        - [Brandon Toner tweeted a helpful thread](https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1334910004823003137) for getting started if your appetite has been whet and you can't wait for my longer form article to be published with my experiments and examples.
        - Speaking of Brandon, [one of the many ideas he's had](https://twitter.com/brandontoner/status/1334890269716733961?s=20) for SmartBlocks are smart templates. It is already possible to trigger different templates for the day of the week, but how far can we take this? Can we further customise and optimise them for our mood, working context and so on? As Brandon mentioned, [[The Discipline]] which I have been using for the last few months (see [[LFR/Letter IV]] for the article I wrote), seems a prime candidate for triggering a dynamic change. For example, if on Create days, imagine having Roam automatically configure itself with a minimalist, clean theme that encourages focus, and doesn't add my section for [[Resonance Calendar]] - since my focus is to create, not collect. In an even grander vision, I envisage my whole digital environment getting triggered. [This article series](http://evantravers.com/articles/2020/06/19/hammerspoon-headspace/) by Evan Travers hints at some possibilities using Hammerspoon on Mac OS X. Imagine if I could read or send out what I had programmed my attention with in Roam, e.g. it's a Create day, and not only configure my Roam environment, but also prevent my Mac from allowing me to open Twitter and automatically begin a Brain.FM focus session allowing me to get straight to work writing or thinking.
        - This leads us naturally on to [[Algorithms of Thought]].
    - ### Algorithms of Thought
        - One of the most exciting applications for SmartBlocks is in implementing [[Algorithms of Thought]]. [[Lukas Kawerau (@cortexfutura)]] has written [an excellent introduction](https://www.cortexfutura.com/getting-started-algorithms-of-thought/), in case you're not familiar with the term.
        - Plus he was also in the spotlight for the second Roam hangout last Friday on the topic. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend so I'm looking forward to watching the video replay to catch up fully on the discussion.
        - While it's nice to get carried away with the potential possibilities, we do also need to be mindful that [[Zettels/Simple, trusted systems which augment and compensate for our brains limitations are desirable over those which seek to automate our thinking]].
        - As I talked about previously in [[LFR/Letter IV]] when I discussed [[Augmentation over Automation]] we ought to aim at and straddle a fine line.
        - Our biggest challenge will be in ensuring that we do not accidentally create "thinking bubbles" for ourselves just as the algorithms of Google, Twitter, and Facebook can cause echo-chambers of agreement, feeding us only what we like instead of thinking more critically and clearly.
        - If we can strike the balance of mindful use of techniques which help to highlight unconscious biases or consider alternative approaches against  simply "outsourcing" our thinking by installing the latest "Better Thinking"™ plugin like something from The Matrix then, combined with other advances in collaborating with others, we could really accelerate our progress.
        - This is a large topic which I'll no doubt be digging into more over coming letters. As ever, if you have any thoughts or questions I'd love to hear from you. You can reply to this email, or reach out to me on Twitter. To learn more, here are three great articles I highly recommend reading.
        - First, is [another article](https://www.cortexfutura.com/algorithms-of-thought-have-arrived/) by [[Lukas Kawerau (@cortexfutura)]] which follows on from his previous one and walks through creating a simple Next Action algorithm with SmartBlocks.
        - Next is a fantastic article by Zsolt Vicián which looks to be the first in a series of articles on the subject. Zsolt walks us through SmartBlocks implementations of [6 thinking tools from Edward de Bono](https://www.zsolt.blog/2020/12/de-bonos-algorithms-of-thought-for.html).
            - https://twitter.com/zsviczian/status/1335368671796076545
        - And last, but by no means, least is Mark McElroy's "[A metaphysician looks at algorithms of thought](https://markmcelroy.com/a-metaphysican-looks-at-algorithms-of-thought/)" where he explores the boundary where templates end and algorithms of thought begin. Of particular timely interest to me, is his assertion that [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Zettelkasten]] method is itself an Algorithm of Thought. I completely agree, the process can be broken down into a series of steps and executed on. The beauty of the system is that it is simple to quickly master but can produce profound results.
