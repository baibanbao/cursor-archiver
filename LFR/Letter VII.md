- ## Around the Roaman Empire
    - Once again, there's a lot going on in the world of #RoamCult so this time around here's a quick roundup of the last couple of weeks which has caught my attention.
    - ### YouTube TimeStamp
        - Twitter user [@cococ_rr](https://twitter.com/cococ_rr) has created a nice [Roam/JS extension](https://gist.github.com/c3founder/0d47fe3f15f677a0a6f0e96b4868e46a) which not only enables a responsive YouTube player but also allows you to click on the timestamps you write in the child blocks of the embedded video to jump straight to that section.
    - ### Hill Charts in Roam
        - If you use Roam for project management, this one might be particularly exciting. If you're familiar with Basecamp, the project management tool you'll know they have a [feature they call Hill Charts](https://basecamp.com/features/hill-charts) which gives you a more visual indication of where you really stand on the project progress. [Austin Birch](https://twitter.com/austinbirch) is [building an extension to bring this to Roam](https://twitter.com/austinbirch/status/1329025821466570753). It looks like Austin has it working with native Roam elements like block references so hooking it up to your TODOs should be a cinch.
    - ### Tag Cycles
        - David Vargas continues to add to his impressive list of [roamjs.com](roamjs.com) extensions. [Tag Cycles](https://roamjs.com/docs/extensions/tag-cycle) extends the concept of Roam's native Ctrl-Enter/Command-Enter keyboard shortcut which toggles TODO and DONE states.
            - You can define a series of tags with a custom keyboard shortcut to set status tags for your workflows
    - ### Roam Improvement
        - As ever, Roam itself continues to improve day by day with the global graph filters and inline audio player amongst other improvements. However, I wanted to call more attention to a nice set of improvements to the hidden but powerful block search functionality aka `Control-Shift-9`.
        - You can now find and create blocks anywhere across your graph from this page, and then copy the block reference to reference right where you are.
        - Sometimes a quick gif paints a thousand words. Here's me searching my graph for where I know I've referenced the keyboard shortcut for this feature and grabbing its block reference to paste here as I collate this weeks letter.
            - `Control-Shift-9` to bring up search for blocks narrowed by pages
        - ![Quick Demo](http://share.foxsoft.co.uk/zl5Zle+)
            - Extra information on how I do that is included in the Roam JSON I include in each email.
                - On opening the window, I hit Left Arrow (or `Control-H`) to move the path "back" from my current page, do the search across the entire graph, arrow down to the one I'm looking for (You can also use `Control-J` and `Control-K` to move up and down), and then I hit `Enter` twice. The first time to select it, the second time to copy its block reference, which also closes the window and pastes it into the block I was on when I brought up the panel in the first place.
        - More information and a short video demo by [[Conor White-Sullivan]] is available on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1330129329603358723).
- ## Quick Roam Tip
    - Roam has plenty of fancy tricks up its sleeve but some of the simplest are the best. As I covered in [[LFR/Letter VI]], [[Roamhacker]]'s [[Roam42]] now offers a convenient converter, which is great for getting your formatted content out easier. However, if you just need the text, [[Ramses Oudt]] shared this little gem:
        - You can select just the text without selecting the blocks themselves if you have your cursor *outside* the main area.
            - ![A quick gif demo of how to move your cursor further right](http://share.foxsoft.co.uk/XQ8lBx+)
    - We're all always learning, and we can't know everything, but we can all learn from each other. One of the reasons I started publishing these letters was so that I can share nuggets that I've learnt which can sweeten your Roam experience. Please do send me any Roam tricks you've learned so I can share them with a wider audience. It's easy to forget that just because it's obvious to you, it's not also obvious to others.
- ## Thinking Out Loud
    - ### RoamCult(ure)
        - The [[RoamCult]] are an interesting and diverse set of people. [[David Crandall]] [shared a great idea last week](https://twitter.com/DavidCrandall_W/status/1328751322863185921?s=20). In his Roam database he has a [[Glossary & Talking Points]] page. It contains a cross-section of terms and topics from across his database, of the many things that interest him and would happily nerd out on with like-minded people.
        - I really like this; creating a common format for sharing your interests that emerge from your graph. If we could publish or share this page easily it would be an amazing way to find and connect with like-minded others - a new kind of social network. It's one of the reasons that I enjoy this community so much, it's filled with such varied interesting people, somehow bound together through this common tool.
        - About a month ago David and I had a Zoom chat where we did just that! We nerded out on topics as diverse as being a [[Fractional CTO]], [[Roam]] (of course), and [[The Discipline]]. I'm sure we'll be doing a follow-up soon with [[Stoicism]] high on our list.
        - I went ahead and registered the domain [roamcultu.re](http://roamcultu.re). I'm envisaging a site where you could upload a Roam JSON export of your own [[Glossary & Talking Points]] page and preferred method/s of contact. The site would let you browse the topics you're interested in and show you who else shares them with you so you can reach out and make new friends with ready conversation starters.
        - Before I spend time building something no-one wants, I'd love to gauge interest in this idea. Hit reply and tell me! Or [send me a DM or tweet on Twitter](twitter.com/elaptics).
    - ### Zettelkastens in Roam
        - As I write this, there's two weeks left in the [[Roam Book Club]] with two live sessions to go. This week, the aim is to create permanent notes (or Zettels) from the fleeting and literature notes from the previous weeks. It's been fascinating so far as everyone has been journeying together reading [[book/How to take smart notes]] and wrestling with the concepts of the [[Zettelkasten]] and implementing it within Roam.
        - While I'd read [[book/How to take smart notes]] for the first time back in March of this year I don't think I'd fully "got" it until this second reading. One of the biggest reasons for that is that as someone who's been in the "productivity" space for some time, I thought I knew it all. In reality, I'd made lots of assumptions.
        - Back in August, through the second cohort of [[fabricating serendipity]], I met [[Beau Haan]]. If you're a member of [[Roam Book Club]] you'll know he has been an instrumental part in it.
        - Since then, we've been meeting regularly as thinking and accountability partners. Beau revealed he'd developed a robust system for implementing a [[Zettelkasten]] in Roam and through several interventions he helped me to challenge all my assumptions of what a [[Zettelkasten]] is, such that I am completely breaking down and rebuilding my process from the ground up. **It has been eye-opening, and transformative.**
        - This coming Sunday ([[November 29th, 2020]]) during the book club call, Beau will be demonstrating live -- if you've joined the book club, it will be worth showing up for I promise!
        - In the past week or so, those of you who follow me on Twitter may have seen that I'm using the platform to hold myself publicly accountable to adding at least 80 new Zettels by December 31st to my Zettelkasten system in Roam, which is a direct byproduct of this process.
            - Beau is taking it to another level, committing to adding an additional 270 notes by the end of 2020.
        - This week Beau has cleared his calendar and is offering his time to help book club members implement their own Zettelkasten in Roam.

        - As many of you will know, since publishing my Roam course earlier this year I've been thinking about the next iteration as a more group-based collaborative approach. Over the last 6 months, I've received hundreds of emails from new Roam users with similar struggles and pains, and the "baggage" people bring from their previous note-taking systems. 
        - If your ultimate aim is to think better then stay tuned. In the spirit of openness and transparency, and with our desire to work and learn in public, Beau and I are working on something. Right now, we don't know exactly what it's going to look like, but we do know that it won't be just another Roam course. Our aim is to help you build a personal Zettelkasten in Roam that's not just an archive but a true conversation partner that you can have an ongoing dialogue with to help you solidify and refine your thinking.
