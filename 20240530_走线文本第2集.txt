 Previously on Walk the Line. As hundreds of Chinese citizens enter the U.S. illegally via its southern border every day, more are following in their footsteps. I fly to Ecuador to join their journey. Some guy just whistled at me from that shop. The smuggler might be thinking I'm one of his merchandise. And meet a family in Colombia as they prepare to cross the Darien Gap. I'm sorry. Amen. Mom, Dad and Lucy left China almost a month ago, taking detours through Thailand and Turkey before arriving in South America. How did you get on this road? We wanted to take our children out of here.你們是怎麼走上這條路的我們當時就是很想簡單的就是就想把孩子帶出去因為我們的女兒她是在教會學校上學就是所謂的教會學校就是在中國是屬於違法教學它屬於地下學校但是江陵教會被衝擊之後教會被取締學校也被衝擊沒有了曾經在我們家也上了两三个月后来就被无意中又被他们发现了发现了后来就也不能上了我们在成都那个租房那个房东就远回来跟我说我这个房租下面就不给你续了规划是谁做的?对,我是通过那个YouTube还有TikLum汇集资料就自己DIY嘛因为钱不多嘛没有多少钱多少钱一个一家人反正20万不到嘛哦 那是真的对 预算是很紧张的就只能是DIY嘛嗯就一步一步来嘛现在想起来郭雨林担心吗我担心他怕他那个他没怎么是那种运动的类型的孩子而且他是这样子他走几步会头疼啊所以我就怕他身体吃不消所以我就买了很多东西爸为什么不担心就像我们在船上一样虽然海里有风浪但是上帝他一直与我们同在,所以我就不为他心。就算船翻了,也是上帝与我们同在,我们进入祂的怀抱。現在沒有回到路可以走對因為我很渴望那種自由就是說你免於恐懼你說什麼做什麼只要是不侵犯他人,你都是自由的我就很想這種感覺,但是我從來沒有擁有過實話,我沒有他那麼大的理想、抱負我就想到我的孩子以後的出路是好的是清醒的不要像我這麼累其實我們很單純覺得美國別的環境我們過去一劫就可以了這種不好吃这个是啥猪腿肉三百块钱两方肉太贵了这这个三块九毛五换算成人民币的话三十块了三十块贵我靠 这个三十四块九毛九一包好贵多少钱多少钱三万我看一下二十块四毛三二十块四毛三我光买点零食二十块四毛三大哥,有没有啥活啊?有,有个仓库嘛就只有仓库?美国就是这个样子,美国就是这个环境反正最近好多人回去了十个人里面现在应该有一个以上回去了再过段时间就两个三个最后要四个五个生存艰难美国不是想象中的美国美国已经玩毒死了美国摔坏了但是还是很多人来外边还有很多人要来美国已经玩毒了美国摔坏了对了太衰美国了但是还是很多人来过年该有很多人要来说是要很多人对大哥有活干说一声 It's been 12 hours since Carlos left Nacocli to try and get us access to the Darien Gap from the drug cartel that controls the area. Take care guys, I'll see you in a bit. He had promised to be back by sunset, but so far he's nowhere to be seen. In recent months, the cartel has issued death threats against several reporters. I can no longer sit on my hands, so I call another local journalist who's dealt with the cartel before. Carlos went in today. He sort of didn't come back. Should I be worried? He didn't come back. He didn't come back today. He went, I think he took the 7.30, 8 o'clock boat. Okay. Okay. Is there anything else we could do? Honestly, no, because if you don't get that yes, I think it would be a really bad idea to go. A really bad idea in what sense? Thank you. I'm sorry. Without getting a go-ahead from Carlos, we cannot depart for the Darien Gap with the Chinese migrants. But I want to see them off, as they are about to embark on the most challenging part of the journey, a multi-day trek through a virgin jungle. Nicocli is a beach resort in Colombia, but his fortunes took a dive during the pandemic. Since then, migrants have taken over the town. On the beach, clusters of large families, mostly Venezuelan, camp out, sometimes for months until they find enough money to buy ferry tickets to move forward. The United Nations Refugee Agency provides them with clean drinking water, but that's about all the help they get. By contrast, the Chinese move through Nicocli quickly on the pier I begin to see familiar faces it seemed like they're in good shape carrying very little stuff I think they've gotten rid of most of their belongings it's gonna be a two and a half hour boat ride to copper canal where they'll have to wait on the night to go again on illegal roads at night into Panama. That's where they start the fraud. Colombia in the past year has come under increasing US pressure to stop the flow of migrants. But in the Coquely, you can hardly sense that. Carlos told me even though there are police on the streets in Nekakli, the town is under And that might explain why the police hardly bat an eye while hundreds of migrants move under their watch. The family and the other migrants we had gone shopping with are also set to depart today, but I don't see them on a pier. There have been reports of raping women, mistreatment of the young people, children and young women to be given to other gangs that are involved in the sexual trade and the prostitution chains and that sort of things.这种东西 Brother, that's great. What time can you leave? What time can you leave? You told me at 4 a.m. Turns out by showing up at the family's lodging the day before, we had alarmed the smuggler, so he moved the entire group out of Nikakli before dawn. So he moved the entire group out of Nekakli before dawn. Everything is happening faster than we anticipated. But unfortunately for us, another day goes by without any word from Carlos for us to enter the Darien Gap. I just don't believe them anymore. That's all right. Sit down, sit down. And you know that right? Suddenly, Carlos shows up. This is incredible because when I arrived on the boat like two days ago, the army was on the docks. In Capricorn? In Capricorn. Two days ago, the army was on the docks. Like, in Caprganá. In Caprganá. Fuller, dressed, machine guns, bullets, you know? Yeah. I'm like, what the? First time I seen them there like this. The army got in like two, three days ago, looking for smugglers, you know, because they've been two arrested already. Yeah. So this jungle commando is in the jungle, and these guys are like, look, man, I give you the permit, you go in the jungle, something happens, it's on us. Something happens, like a shootout, and someone, some of you get injured or anything, it's like, I can't do this. I can't. You know, and- How unusual is this for the Colombian army to go into the jungle? Incredible unusual. That's not their turf, right? They don't control that area. Incredible unusual. They never been there in 18 years. We have prepared for months of both physically and mentally for the Darien Gap. But the journey is not to be. Now we must come up with a different plan. We were waiting in the car for three days, but the drug cartel eventually told us we were not welcome. That's why we now have to leave. So we head to Panama, hoping to catch up with the Chinese migrants on their way out of the Darien Gap. In Panama, migrants aren't allowed to roam free. They're taken into government-run migrant reception centers as soon as they emerge from the Darien Gap and then bust onto the next country. So our chances of encountering them on a street is next to none. I'm just trying to enter one of the migrant reception centers. one of the migrant reception centers. It's controlled by the border police. So they......stepped into a puddle. I've lost touch with the family, so now I have no choice. That whole van of soldiers that just went past me. I'm pretty sure they saw me, but they didn't care. it just went past me. I'm pretty sure they saw me but they didn't care. We've made our way into one of the migrant reception centers. There were some people charging their phones there. One Chinese guy. Have you seen Chinas? It's a bit confounding, given Inukkale on the dog. Most people we see are Chinese. So let's see. How long have you been here? 17 days. Why do the Chinese people get to leave so quickly? Pasan la noche y al día siguiente ya se van en la mañana. 17 días ya. Porque ellos pagan el pasaje rápido. 60 dólares por persona. Hasta los niños pagan. Imagínate, nosotros somos 12. Tenemos como 100. Porque estamos ayudando haciendo labor social. We are 12. How much money do you have? We have about 100. What are you going to do? We are helping with social work. They don't give us money. They extort the money and send us to Costa Rica. Just as I'm giving up hope to catch the family in Panama... Hello? in Panama. The family has recorded their journey through the Darien Gap. A 55-kilometer track over mountains and rivers. Many of their fellow Chinese quickly tire out and pay porters to carry their bags and children. The trek takes two and a half days, and at each day's end they set out to camp with large swaths of the jungle and gap, they get fresh fruit and Coca-Cola. And pay for Wi-Fi in order to call me.哥们 你好我这边是坐二手车的坐这现在有中国驾照的话也可以开有中国驾照也可以开吗前面半年,六個月加我一年加我一年無車買車的需求的話可以聯繫我然後你們現在沒有身份的話也可以貸款買車沒錯包括你現在沒有銀行卡的話你買的車不是特別貴的話就買幾千塊錢車的話我們像我們車行業自己已經借給你假如你買個一萬塊錢左右的車你首付就三千塊錢假如你首付我们车行也自己你车是什么假如你买个一万块钱左右的车你首付就三千块钱假如你这种首付不够的话我们也可以给你垫着你到时候你后面每个月也按来给像这种月供的话一个月的月供也就两百多块钱那大哥我想问一下通过这个车去跑跑一亚跑游户啥的吗可以啊也可以假如你送快递送不是你也不可能天天去送你预划你挣五千块钱的话比你在国内挣三万块钱日子过得都舒服OK你买了特别买车你会发现比买个手机还简单这边画就是红车公园 丁胖子丁胖子广场这边华人第一站都是来这里我经常来这边,因为这边刚来的人多待在这边大部分人都是没有车的有些人虽然在这边挂�幣但那只是一小部分人掛幣的話他們就是在這邊天呆著大部分人想的是掙快錢像國內那種掙快錢的態度覺得眼前的家屬他覺得一個月在這邊掙兩三千塊錢的話他覺得這種工作做不做無所謂他覺得他不能給他一個很富裕的生活 If I can only get a few thousand yuan, I don't care if I can do this job. If I can't give him a rich life, I don't want to be a slave. In Panama, we get up bright and early for the only opportunity to see the Chinese migrants in this country. We've come to Puerto Lamon, a small Panamanian village at the exit of the Darien Gap. You could see walking around here how the migration trade has completely transformed this place. All these stalls are built up to cater to migrants. And it's also interesting how the Chinese have left a footprint. The signs, other than the ones in Spanish, which is their native language, the most visible ones are in Chinese. Take a look at there. Take a look at there. Just look at this sign here. It says China Bodega. Exchanging US dollar. Utilising WeChat Pay and Alipay. That's what usually the migrants, the Chinese migrants have on them. migrants have on them. This is basically all the stuff you can get from a grocery shop in China. Master Kong instant noodles with Spam on the side. Wang Lao Ji is a sweet herbal drink, very popular with the Chinese. Sunflower seeds, Latiao, sort of a spice mix, very popular again in China. You know, somebody must have been acquiring these things directly from China because I've never seen these things in South America. Look at the handwriting. This is much better than my handwriting, so there's no question a real Chinese person is behind this shop. And it's really mind-boggling how this ecosystem can so quickly form around the migration trade. The boats are is our family. This one? The fourth boat is our family. I'm beginning to see familiar faces. That's Antti, the one in pink. They look tired. I can tell Auntie looks very tired. Mama's a bit unsteady.谢谢你身体怎么样是不是有点虚弱没有我还好来 大家怎么样怎么样平安就好平安就好 朋友平安就好好太危险了好我们觉得是解了一条命管用蜚蜜换出来的平安就好平安就好来好 We thought it was a honey-bath. I hope you're safe. Come on. Let's go. We brought my sunglasses.

I've flown from Panama City to Tapachula, Mexico's southern border. The family and the other Chinese migrants should be arriving here in the next couple of days, having bussed their way through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. Up until this point, Chinese migrants are easy to spot on a migration trail. But in Mexico, that becomes much harder. That's because after Panama, thousands of Central Americans join the migration trail each day, fleeing violence and poverty at home. So by comparison, Chinese migrants are now a less prominent group. ¿Ustedes quieren quedarse en Tapachula? Todos. ¿Todos queremos irnos de Tapachula? Sí. Estamos aquí buscando un mejor futuro para nuestros hijos y para nosotros mismos. ¿De acuerdo? ¿De dónde vienen estas personas? ¿De dónde quieren ir? These people, where did they come from and where are they trying to go? Currently, this group here represents 24 nationalities. All of Central America, Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba, Africa, Asia, Ukrainians, Russians, the majority, 90% of the people here want to fulfill the American dream, to go to the United States. If they are trying to go to America, why are so many of them here? The National Institute of Immigration in Mexico has decided not to give any more procedures under pressure from the US government. Luis is now gathering signatures for a petition to the court, hoping the judiciary will force immigration authorities to give in. Otherwise he threatens to lead a caravan of migrants and walk on foot to reach the U.S. border. There are a lot of Chinese migrants coming to Tapachula, right? Why do I not see them here? Los migrantes pobres, que son estos que estamos viendo acá, son los que no pueden pagar para poder salir adelante. Where are you from? Honduras. Honduras. How long have you been in Tabachula? Four months. I've been fleeing Honduras. My family killed me. My mother, my father, my son, my sister. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. The countries the Chinese migrants have passed through so far are all challenging in their own rights. pass through so far are all challenging in their own rights. But now I'm beginning to sense that Mexico could be an entirely different game. The Chinese migrants are beginning to reach Guatemala, the last country they'll have to get through before entering Mexico. We'll be at the hotel tomorrow. Okay, if you cross the river tomorrow morning, tell us as soon as possible that we'll wait for you at the river. Okay, have a safe trip. I'm eager to see them as soon as possible, so we're taking a drive out of Tapachula to the Suchiate River, Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. It's a border unlike any I've seen before. I'm in Mexico. The other side of the river is Guatemala. This border crossing is super busy but super informal. I haven't seen anyone checking any papers. The people on the rafts going across is a mix of locals and migrants. It is hard for us to tell which one is which. And all the time we've been here, we haven't seen any Chinese migrants coming across. Our local fixer, Benjamin, tells us that we must stay on the north side of the river bridge because the south side is controlled by smuggling gangs who don't want their operations exposed. So we're relieved to hear that the family plans to cross the river on their own using one of the crossings we have access to. But hours go by and we still don't see them. These people have to ride a tricycle. The cyclists take them down there. They ride a tricycle up there. So they probably went to the other side. They're just right there.我看一下你的定位我看一下你的定位好吗他们就在那里他们就在那里杜葳杜葳我们全部抢光了我们全部抢光了那个爸爸人没事吧爸爸我们全部抢光了我们全部抢光了那个爸爸人没事吧没事啊吓到了是不是对 我们全部抢光了我们面前还瘦身了把衣服都脱光了全部都抢了什么人抢的起码是六批人在那里每一个人带一批人然后你举动的把包全部放掉放掉以后把衣服全部脱掉收女的一个都不放过对吧平安就好我现在在这里动不了真不暖心吃饭都没钱没事他们说我们现在钱都不敢取因为有一堆的飞车党在那边等着我们去取钱我们吃钱不敢取简单说那我们这里能打Uber吗?这里没有Uber这样我没有 because there are a bunch of caravans waiting for us to get the money. Can we take an Uber here? There's no Uber here. No, there's no Uber here. I can take an Uber. No, you have to pay for the taxi. That's a problem. Mexico makes assisting migrants in transit a crime, so there's nothing we can do. The Chinese migrants find a group of Venezuelans hoping they can tag along. Finally, a driver stops, agreeing to get paid after reaching Tapachula. OK, they're going now. We'll just follow that route. Got it. There are three immigration checkpoints on the way back to the city. I'm curious how they would navigate so we follow their van. They're all getting out of the vehicle because there's an immigration checkpoint ahead. So they have to go to the other side of the road, walk on foot, hoping they won't get stopped and then get picked up by the van on the other side. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, you're okay. Don't love me. Okay, I'll be with you guys. Okay. But only a few minutes later, we see the van stop by the roadside again, where there's no checkpoint. Keep going, keep going. Keep going. Sorry, sorry. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop. Why do you think they stopped there? What's there? The transport lowers them, deceiving them that there is a checkpoint, which was not there. So it lowers them, makes them walk, surround them, so that they can get ahead, and pay once again for public transport. The second is to assault or rob them. In the couple of hours that they've spent in Mexico, they've walked into a trap for a second time. Our fixer Benjamin says it would be incredibly dangerous for us to try to find them. He insists that we drive on.你们到了塔帕斯一定通知我好吗 I'm
