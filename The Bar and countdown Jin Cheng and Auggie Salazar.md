Unimportant roles

A bar singer

A bystander



\[music builds to a terrifying crescendo\]

\[“I Kissed a Girl” playing\]

♪ I kissed a girl, and I liked it ♪

♪ The taste of her cherry ChapStick I kissed… ♪

\[quietly\] Wow.

Confidence.

You know you’re carrying me home, right?

I’ve done it before.

\[both\] Salud.

\[mouthing\] Thank you.

\[out of tune\] ♪ I kissed a girl, and I liked it… ♪

It’s possible our bar has gone to shit.

Second law of thermodynamics. Eventually, everything turns to shit.

Physics is turning to shit. Bars can’t be far behind.

Explain to me what’s going on.

Okay…

So, you ladies are gonna sing a song?

No.

\[man\] No? What do you mean, no?

You’re not… not singers?

No.

\[man chuckles\] All right.

What do you do, then? Hmm?

Wait. Hold on. Don’t tell me. Let me guess. You probably…

I design self-assembling, synthetic polymer nanofibers.

I started a company that manufactures them

for a variety of potential medical, energy, and materials applications.

And you?

I’m a senior researcher in the Theoretical Physics group

at Imperial College.

I’m doing a metastudy analyzing the results

of particle accelerator experiments around the world.

Nice one. Yeah.

\[MC\] Rufus, you’re up!

\[Rufus\] Yeah, all right. That’s me!

Yeah, enjoy it. Bye.

Okay, why is everyone freaking out?

\[sighs\]

About a month ago,

all the major accelerators started generating results

that make no fucking sense.

♪ It’s nine o’clock on a Saturday ♪

\[crowd cheers\]

♪ And the regular crowd shuffles in ♪

♪ There’s an old man sitting next to me ♪

♪ Making love to his tonic and gin ♪

\[vocalizing\]

Go on, you know it!

Come have a smoke with me.

That shit’ll kill you.

Yeah. So will this.

\[Rufus\] ♪ Play me a memory? ♪

\[“Take on Me” playing\]

♪ I don’t know what I’m to say ♪

♪ I’ll say it anyway… ♪

Wow.

\[Jin\] Mm.

Saul sent that one just last week from Oxford.

It’s been a while since Particle Physics, but, I mean, this can’t…

Nope. It can’t.

Well, then, maybe it’s a hack.

\[scoffs\]

In every accelerator on the planet?

I went through the CERN code, line by line. Nothing.

The code for the centralized software? How many lines is that?

It’s a lot, Auggie. It’s a lot of fucking lines.

Okay, so it’s a hardware issue.

Dipole magnets, muon chambers, calorimeters,

every component checked four times over in every collider from here to Beijing.

Okay, so what does Saul say?

He says it’s impossible.

What about you?

\[sighs\] These experiments teach us how the universe works.

And that?

That’s fucking Alice in Wonderland. \[clicks tongue\]

\[cell phone ringing\]

Now he calls.

I texted him to come three times, and he wouldn’t even text me back.

\[scoffs\]

\[energy thrumming\]

See how you like it.

You guys are like 14-year-olds.

\[sighs\]

\[cell phone beeps\]

\[Auggie chuckles\]

Take it. He’s probably high as fuck.

It’s fine. Take it.

\[Jin\] Hey.

\[exhales deeply\]

\[tense music playing\]

\[lighter clicks\]

Hey.

Oh. Hey, hi.

\[softly\] Do you see that?

See what?

That.

Huh?

\[gasps softly\]

\[Rufus\] You all right, love?

\[inhales sharply\]

\[energy thrumming\]

\[breathing shakily\]

\[Jin\] Auggie?

\[gasps\]

Vera Ye just killed herself.
