# 九天九夜－－Susan Smith案


## 失踪

Union－南卡罗莱纳州的一座只有三万多人的小镇，在1994年10月25日这一天成为全美国关注的焦点。Susan Smith，一位23岁的母亲向警局报案说：一个黑人歹徒劫持她的汽车，车上还有她的两个儿子，3岁的Michael和14个月的Alex。

Susan说，她带着两个孩子开车，到一个路口遇到红灯。这时，车上窜上来一个黑人，强迫她把车开向高速公路。行驶了4-5英里后，歹徒命令她下车。任凭她苦苦哀求把孩子留下，歹徒都没有理会，开着这辆马自达逃窜而去。她绝望地扑到在公路上，找到最近一户人家，电话报警。

一次当地最大规模的搜索行动开始了，FBI也派来了警力增援。当地居民自发驾车，假如到搜索队伍中。美国的媒体云集到Union镇。这座平常一到晚上就家家关门闭户的小城，一下子变得热闹拥挤。而几乎每个赶到这里采访的记者，都会在路上被居民拦下来，问他们有没有见过两个失踪的孩子。受害者的照片，警方的协查通报，以及根据报案人描述的嫌犯画像，通过卫星在全美国广播。

几乎所有美国人都在焦急地关注两个男孩的命运。

这一宗奇案。两个孩子在母亲眼皮底下被掳并失踪，对很多美国家长来说，听上去都像一场恶梦。小镇的人们自发在树上、门口系上黄丝带，祈祷两个孩子平安归来。

在电视上，Susan和她的丈夫David，泪如雨下，乞求歹徒，不要伤害两个孩子。

这是案件发生后，美国报纸的部分报道标题。

## 突转

既然案情扑朔迷离，毫无进展，媒体开始把焦点转移到了Susan Smith身上。记者们调查发现，Susan是个问题缠身的女人。她跟丈夫感情已破裂，她很几个男人都有染。她最近一个男朋友，是她老板的大儿子。在孩子失踪前一天，她收到了这个男朋友的一封信。信上写到，他准备跟Susan断绝关系，因为他不想当别人孩子的爸爸。

> "But like I told you before, there are some things about you that aren't suited to me, and yes, I am speaking about your children."

这是一个重大线索。

11月3日，失踪案发生8天以后，媒体报道了这样两条消息。

> 警方搜索Smith的家(11/3/94)
> 
> 报警电话录音带曝光(11/3/94)

11月4日上午，媒体接到警方的通知，将在下午召开新闻发布会。在现场焦急地等待了一个多小时之后，主管此案的Wells警官，带着一脸疲惫和愁容出现了。他宣读了一个简单的通告。

> Susan Smith涉嫌杀人罪被逮捕。

举国震惊，但最惊骇的是当地的居民。他们不敢相信这是真的，一个母亲怎么会杀害自己的孩子。

一位当地居民说：“这种事怎么可能发生在我们的小镇，这种事只会发生在纽约这样的大都市！”他继续愤怒地说：“我们被这个女人的表演欺骗了！应该授给她奥斯卡奖！”

当地的黑人更是难以掩饰内心的愤怒，因为这9天以来，他们几乎是在白人的森森白眼中度过的。

事实的真相逐渐显露出来。

Susan Smith在被请到警局之后，接受了两次测谎，两次结果都不能证明她无辜。终于，Susan对审问她的警官Wells说：

> 能不能跟我一起做个祷告？

Wells答应了。祷告完毕，Susan招供了。她供述：接到男朋友的信的时候，她意识到男友不希望要这两个孩子。于是她把孩子绑到汽车座椅上，把车开到了湖里。然后，自己报警，编造出了黑人劫车的故事。

警方从湖水中打捞出那辆马自达，果然，两个男孩被绑到座位上。

## 审判

Smith案开庭。



Susan的律师辩护说，Susan从15岁开始，就受到过继父的性侵害。她一直承受着巨大的精神压力，在男人面前没有安全感。Susan是在绝望无助的情况下，才杀死了自己的孩子。陪审团用了2个半小时，达成一致。Susan Smith因谋杀罪，被判处30年监禁。

Susan入狱之后，有两名看守因为跟她发生性关系而被捕。

It was a crime that devastated a small South Carolina town and horrified a nation. Susan Smith had confessed to doing the unthinkable, killing her two young sons by strapping them in their car seats and rolling the car into the John D. Long Lake.

Smith appeared in a Union, South Carolina court in January, where her lawyer, David Bruck, said Smith would not enter a plea in the case. A plea of not guilty was then entered on her behalf.

The prosecution, led by 32-year old Tommy Pope, announced it would seek the death penalty for Smith. As her trial began in July, the facts of the crime were never in doubt, but the prosecution and defense presented vastly different images of Smith to the jury.

Prosecutors tried to present Smith as a cold-blooded killer. They described her as a woman who drowned her three-year-old son Michael and 14 month-old son Alex to win the affections of a man with whom she had been having an affair. That man, Tom Findlay, took the stand and read a letter he had written to Smith breaking off their relationship. Findlay wrote, "But like I told you before, there are some things about you that aren't suited to me, and yes, I am speaking about your children."

The defense, on the other hand, painted a picture of a deeply disturbed and depressed young woman who had suffered from sexual molestation at the hands of her stepfather.

After five days of testimony, and with Smith's confession virtually assuring a guilty verdict, the jury received the case. It took the nine man, three woman panel only two and a half hours to reach a verdict: guilty on two counts of murder.

Next came the sentencing phase of the trial, with the jury to decide whether Smith deserved the death penalty for her crime. As testimony began again, prosecutors called the boys' father, David Smith, to the stand. He had stood by his estranged wife for nine days in October 1994, pleading for the release of his two sons after she told the world they had been kidnapped.

But in emotional testimony, Smith called for his former wife to be put to death for her crimes. He tearfully told the jury all his hopes, dreams and everything he had planned on for the rest of his life had ended that day.

Prosecutors showed the jury a re-enactment of Susan Smith's Mazda sinking into John D. Long lake. A camera was mounted on the back seat so jurors could get a picture of what the boys saw for the last six minutes of their lives as the car went down in the water.

When the defense began its case in the sentencing phase of the trial, it again focused on Susan Smith's troubled past. Jurors heard of the divorce of her parents when she was six and her father's suicide a month later, as well as Smith's own suicide attempts and sexual molestation by her stepfather, Beverly Russell, that later turned into an affair.

Russell himself took the stand, saying he deserved some of the blame in the case. He read from a letter he sent to Smith in prison, saying "you don't have all the guilt in this tragedy," adding that he let her down as a father.

When jurors were given the case, they again took little time to reach a verdict. Susan Smith was sentenced to life in prison. Under South Carolina law, Smith will be eligible for parole in 30 years, although the notorious nature of her crime makes it unlikely she will ever be released.

Following the jury's decision, David Smith, expressed his disappointment with the sentence. Forgiving, Smith said, is "something I guess I'll have to deal with further down the road." Susan Smith's attorney, David Bruck, summed up the case as bad for all, calling it "an awful human tragedy."
