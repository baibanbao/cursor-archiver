Reflections on Bitcoin

The one thing I’ve done right in the financial realm is holding onto some Bitcoin. It saved me from crushing debt, preserved my reputation in the eyes of my parents and family, and, in some ways, it saved my life. Now, it’s time to continue holding rather than selling.

Selling Bitcoin isn’t easy. Buyers are picky; they want to purchase at a steep discount, far below the market price. The only way to avoid selling foolishly is not to sell at all. Holding on to Bitcoin is a decision that could make my child wealthy.

The true value of Bitcoin is far greater than most realize—it should be worth anywhere from $5 million to $23 million per coin. This could make my family as wealthy as Kathy’s. We could live in a luxurious apartment or even a villa, perhaps abroad in the USA, Canada, or New Zealand. With this wealth, my child could receive an excellent education, live the life he desires, and unleash his creativity and passion in the future.

If I sell unwisely, the story ends there. Everything becomes predictable, and there’s no hope for a family like ours. We’re not a civil-servant family; we don’t have many guarantees, and we can’t rely on state welfare. We must depend on ourselves, and in this context, Bitcoin is our only hope.

The future me—future Jonas—will be grateful for this decision. I’d rather endure a tough life than sell our Bitcoin. We are rich in every sense, as wealthy as millionaires like Kathy. We are proud, carefree, and free to do as we please—whether it’s writing, creating, or living life on our terms. No one can stop us, and we can transfer our Bitcoin across borders freely.

Although I understand this theoretically, I must act accordingly. I should see myself as a rich man, not a struggling writer. I am the one. I am the right man. I am the greatest man born in my clan, and I choose to remain low-profile. Someday, I hope my son will understand my decision.

We don’t vacation at the beach because we will own a house on the beach in five or ten years. We don’t buy luxuries because we invest in what truly matters—acquiring knowledge, building a personal brand, expanding our network. We will make a fortune. In fact, we are already rich and will maintain this status from now on.

Let me remember this.

Instead of selling Bitcoin, I will continue to buy more. At least one per year. I will work hard, write more.
