Abstract

Background: Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a well-known inhibitory immune checkpoint. However, its clinical development has faced challenges due to common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and limited efficacy. This has spurred the exploration of CTLA-4-targeted therapies, including next-generation CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibodies. C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8), identified primarily on tumor-resident regulatory T cells (Tregs), has become a target of interest due to the anti-tumor effects demonstrated by CCR8 antibody-mediated Tregs depletion. Consequently, we propose a novel bispecific antibody targeting CCR8 and CTLA-4 that has the potential to enhance T cell activation by blocking CTLA-4-mediated inhibition while selectively depleting regulatory T cells within tumors.


Methods: We designed several bispecific antibodies tailored to the gene expression profiles of CCR8 and CTLA-4. We assessed the developability, in vitro efficacy, and in vivo efficacy of the candidate molecule 2MW4691 through a series of experiments and mouse model studies. Additionally, we conducted a single-dose administration study in cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of 2MW4691.

Results: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirmed the concurrent expression of CCR8 and CTLA-4 in tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells (Tregs) within patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). The candidate molecule 2MW4691 was developed in a tetravalent symmetric format, maintaining a strong binding affinity for CCR8 while exhibiting relatively weaker CTLA-4 binding. This selective binding ability allowed 2MW4691 to target and deplete tumor-infiltrating Tregs with higher specificity. In vitro assays verified the antibody's capacity for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Furthermore, 2MW4691 inhibited the CTLA-4 pathway and enhanced T cell activation, as evidenced by the staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) stimulation assay. The therapeutic efficacy of 2MW4691 was demonstrated in vivo using humanized mice models expressing human CCR8, hCTLA4, and both hCCR8/hCTLA4, which bore MC38 tumors. In cynomolgus monkeys, 2MW4691 was well-tolerated, exhibited the anticipated pharmacokinetic profile, and had a minimal impact on the peripheral T cell population.

Conclusions: These findings suggest that 2MW4691 is a promising candidate for further clinical development.

Synopsis: We report the development of a bispecific antibody that effectively targets CCR8 and CTLA-4, demonstrating significant efficacy in blocking the CTLA-4 pathway and depleting regulatory T cells (Treg).

Introduction

Immunotherapy has become a cornerstone of cancer treatment. With the FDA's approval of ipilimumab in 2011, the first drug of its kind, a new epoch in cancer immunotherapy commenced. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1, serve as crucial modulators of T cell function. The disruption of these checkpoints has achieved unparalleled success across various cancers. In direct comparison within melanoma treatments, anti-CTLA-4 therapies yield lower response rates and a higher incidence of immunotherapy-related adverse effects (irAEs) than anti-PD-1 treatments. Consequently, while anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have seen broadened applications, anti-CTLA-4 has been restricted primarily to melanoma, both as a single agent and more commonly in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents. Despite this, long-term benefits have been observed in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapies. A landmark analysis involving 1861 patients treated with ipilimumab indicated a survival plateau commencing around the third year, extending up to a decade. This underscores the enduring value of anti-CTLA-4 as a component of cancer immunotherapy, necessitating the development of safer and more efficacious CTLA-4 targeted therapies.

The proposed mechanisms of anti-CTLA-4 action include the blockade of CTLA-4/B7 interactions, thus releasing conventionally inhibited T-cells. CD28, a costimulatory molecule essential for T-cell activation, competes with CTLA-4 for the same ligands, B7.1 and B7.2. Given that CTLA-4 has a higher affinity for these ligands, it outcompetes CD28, inhibiting the activation signal of T cells. The second mechanism involves the selective depletion of Tregs, which constitutively express CTLA-4, in contrast to the transient expression on activated conventional T cells. While debates persist regarding the precise mechanisms of anti-CTLA-4, there is a consensus that the maximal therapeutic efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is achieved by preserving both the antagonist activity and the Treg depletion function.


Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. They are also found in abundance within tumors, where they suppress immune responses. Systemic removal of Tregs can trigger robust tumor immunity; however, this approach risks severe autoimmune reactions and immunopathology in healthy tissues. A significant challenge in targeting Tregs is that many markers present on Tregs are also found on activated conventional T cells, such as CD25. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a marker specific to intra-tumor Tregs. Unlike conventional T cells, CCR8 is selectively expressed on Tregs within the tumor microenvironment and is almost undetectable on peripheral Tregs, positioning it as an ideal target for Treg depletion in anti-tumor immunotherapy.

CCR8 is associated with a highly active and suppressive subset of intra-tumor Tregs. However, the prevalence of CCR8-positive Tregs varies across different tumor types, with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showing a range from 6.8% to 38%. This variability indicates the potential limited efficacy of CCR8-targeting antibodies. Several CCR8 antibodies, such as BMS-986340 and GS-1811, are currently in clinical trials. Patient selection for these treatments is challenging due to the dramatic variation in CCR8-positive Treg levels among individuals and the minimal expression of CCR8 on peripheral cells.

In this study, we analyzed the Treg subpopulations within tumors using single-cell RNA sequencing and identified that the CCR8-positive subset represents highly active Tregs with elevated CTLA-4 expression. Consequently, we developed a bispecific antibody, 2MW4691, targeting both CCR8 and CTLA-4 with distinct binding affinities to deplete intra-tumor Tregs with high potency while effectively activating T cells. Our results demonstrated that 2MW4691 effectively depleted Tregs and did not adversely affect peripheral CD8 T cells. In vivo, 2MW4691 inhibited tumor growth effectively. Additionally, it exhibited favorable stability and safety in non-human primates. This research offers a comprehensive insight into Treg subpopulations and introduces a novel approach to Treg depletion therapy.

Materials and Methods

Cells

HEK293-6E cells were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultivated in FreeStyle™ F17 medium (Invitrogen, USA). HEK293-6E (fut8-/-) cells were generated following the guidelines provided by the FUT8 Knock Out Kit (Genloci Biotechnologies Inc., China). Jurkat cells with stable NFAT-luc/hFcγRIIIa expression were sourced from Genomeditech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). These Jurkat-NFAT-luc/hFcγRIIIa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 0.4 mg/mL G418 (Gibco), and 0.75 μg/mL puromycin (Gibco). Human CCR8-expressing CHO K1 cells and HEK293T cells, Jurkat cells expressing cynomolgus CCR8, and CHO K1 cells expressing human CTLA-4 were engineered according to established protocols. CHOK1-hCCR8 and CHOK1-hCTLA-4 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12K medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 4 mg/mL puromycin. Jurkat-cynoCCR8 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, and HEK293T-hCCR8 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1 μg/mL puromycin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were acquired from Schbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Animals

Female hCCR8 knock-in C57BL/6 mice, hCTLA-4 knock-in C57BL/6 mice, and hCCR8/hCTLA-4 double knock-in C57BL/6 mice, aged six to eight weeks, were procured from Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Yicon (Beijing) Biomedical Technology Inc. Experiments involving cynomolgus monkeys were conducted at Suzhou Guochen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., adhering to ethical guidelines as dictated by the relevant committees.

Single-cell RNA-seq Data

The data for non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma patients was sourced from GSE139555, wherein the author sequenced 330 million mRNA transcripts from immune cells. For this study, tumor samples excised during surgery were selected for analysis. Detailed statistical and patient information can be found in the study by Wu, T.D., et al. Additionally, colorectal cancer patient data from GSE146771, which was obtained using the Smart-seq2 platform, includes clinical characteristics of the 10 CRC patients involved in this study.

The scRNA-seq datasets from GSE139555 and GSE146771 underwent stringent quality control, with the exclusion of low-quality cells based on the number of genes expressed and the proportion of mitochondrial gene expression. Batch effects across different patient samples were corrected using the harmony algorithm within Seurat (version 4.3.0). The cell cluster markers identified are depicted in Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.

Data from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, available in GSE110686, were derived from single-cell suspensions prepared from two individual TNBC primary tumor samples. CD3 T cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This dataset was also subject to quality control and batch correction with harmony and was categorized into five distinct clusters.

For plasmid construction and antibody expression, the heavy (H) and light (L) chain genes of CCR8 monoclonal antibodies, bispecific CCR8/CTLA-4 antibodies, and isotype control antibodies were synthesized by Genwiz Biotech (Suzhou, China). These genes were cloned into the eukaryotic expression pTT5 vectors (Addgene, USA). The plasmids for the H and L chains were mixed in various ratios and transiently transfected into HEK293-6E cells using polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Polysciences, USA). After seven days, supernatants containing the target antibodies were centrifuged and purified via protein A affinity chromatography. The same process was used to produce ipilimumab and HBM4003. Fut8 gene knockout HEK293-6E cells were used to produce antibodies lacking fucosylation.

Binding activity characterization by flow cytometry

To assess the binding activity and cross-reactivity across species of candidate CCR8 monoclonal antibodies, we used CHOK1-hCCR8 and Jurkat-cynoCCR8 cells. These cells were collected, washed with FACS buffer (1% FBS in PBS), and then incubated with various concentrations of CCR8 antibodies and an isotype control antibody at 4°C for 1 hour. After three washes, the cells were stained with APC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) for an additional hour. The fluorescence intensity was measured using the iQUE® Flow Cytometer. Similarly, to evaluate the binding efficiency of the bispecific CCR8/CTLA-4 antibodies relative to their parental counterparts, CHOK1-hCCR8 or CHOK1-hCTLA-4 cells were used. These binding assays followed the same protocol but began with different initial concentrations of antibodies.

Blocking activity analysis by flow cytometry

CHOK1-hCTLA-4 cells were enzymatically detached and washed with FACS buffer. The cells were then incubated with biotin-labeled human CD80 (ECD, Fc tag) or CD86 (ECD, his tag) in the presence of a range of concentrations of bispecific antibodies or the parental anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, ipilimumab. Following a one-hour incubation at 4°C, the cells were washed and stained with APC-conjugated Streptavidin (BioLegend, USA). An hour later, the cells were resuspended and the fluorescence signal was quantified using the appropriate channel on the Flow Cytometer.

ADCC Reporter Bioassay

The ADCC (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity) reporter bioassay is a bioluminescence-based method that utilizes luciferase to quantify the ADCC activity of antibodies. In this assay, Jurkat-NFAT-luc/hFcγRIIIa cells served as effector cells, while CHOK1-hCCR8 or CHOK1-hCTLA-4 cells acted as target cells. The protocol is as follows: target cells were collected and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium to achieve a concentration of 0.5×10^6 cells/mL. Then, 20×10^3 cells were dispensed into each well of a white opaque 96-well plate. Antibodies, diluted serially, were added to the wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Simultaneously, effector cells were prepared at a density of 3.75×10^6 cells/mL in fresh RPMI 1640 medium. Subsequently, 150×10^3 effector cells were added to the wells, creating an effector to target cell ratio of 7.5:1. After a 6-hour co-incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2, 100 μL of Bio-Lite detection substrate (Vazyme, China) was introduced to each well and allowed to react for at least 3 minutes. The resulting relative luminescence units (RLU) were measured using a SpectraMax M5e Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, USA).

PBMC ADCC Bioassay

To evaluate the ADCC activity of CCR8 monoclonal antibodies, HEK293T-hCCR8 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were utilized as target and effector cells, respectively. The assay proceeded by incubating the HEK293T-hCCR8 cells with PBMCs in the presence of serially diluted CCR8 monoclonal antibodies at an effector to target ratio of 15:1 at 37°C for 5 hours. After incubation, the LDH-Glo Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega, USA) was used to quantify luminescence in the supernatants, which is indicative of cell lysis and thereby ADCC activity.

Tregs were isolated from PBMCs using the Regulation T cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies, USA), and CD8 T cells were isolated using the Human CD8 T cell Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies, USA). These cells served as target cells. Both Tregs and CD8 T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL IL-2 (Peprotech, USA) and CD3/CD28 activator (Gibco, USA) for three days. On the day before the assay, frozen PBMCs were thawed and pre-treated with IL-2 overnight. The following day, Tregs or CD8 T cells were harvested and labeled with Calcein AM (Invitrogen, USA). The labeled cells were then incubated with 2MW4691 and control antibodies for 30 minutes at 37°C. PBMCs were subsequently added to the plate at a ratio of 50:1 and co-cultured for 5 hours. Supernatants were collected to measure the release of Calcein AM.

Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB) Stimulation Assay:

Frozen PBMCs from two donors were carefully thawed and adjusted with RPMI 1640 medium to a density of 2×10^6/mL. A total of 1×10^5 PBMCs were pre-cultured with 2MW4691 (50, 10, 2 nM) in a 96-well plate for 30 minutes. Subsequently, 400 ng/mL SEB was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional four days at 37°C with 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected to measure the IL-2 concentration using HTRF® technology (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA).

To assess the in vivo efficacy of the anti-CCR8 arms of 2MW4691, 5×10^5 MC38 cells in 100 μL PBS were subcutaneously transplanted into the right flank of C57BL/6-hCCR8 mice. When the tumor sizes reached between 80 mm^3 and 100 mm^3, the mice were randomized into two groups, each consisting of seven mice. The groups were treated with intraperitoneal injections of 2MW4691 (6.66 mg/kg) or isotype control antibody (5 mg/kg) once a week for a total of three weeks.

Subsequently, hCTLA-4 knock-in mice were utilized to evaluate the efficacy of the anti-CTLA-4 arms of 2MW4691. These mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 5×10^5 MC38 cells suspended in 100 μL PBS at the right flank. Similarly, C57BL/6-hCCR8 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5×10^5 MC38 cells in 100 μL PBS at the right flank. Mice with tumors ranging in size from 80 mm^3 to 100 mm^3 were divided into two groups (6 mice per group). They received weekly intraperitoneal administrations of 2MW4691 (1.33 mg/kg) or isotype control antibody (1 mg/kg) for three weeks.

To further evaluate the in vivo efficacy of 2MW4691, hCCR8 and hCTLA-4 double transgenic C57BL/6 mice were used. A suspension of 5×10^5 MC38 cells in 100 μL was subcutaneously injected into the right flank of the mice. When the average tumor volume reached approximately 80 mm^3 to 100 mm^3, thirty-five mice were randomly divided into five groups. The treatment groups were as follows: 0.4 mg/kg isotype_AF, 0.4 mg/kg 2MW4691, 0.3 mg/kg B9BB11_AF, 0.3 mg/kg ipilimumab, and a combination treatment of 0.15 mg/kg B9B11_AF with 0.15 mg/kg ipilimumab. Intraperitoneal injections were administered on days 6, 13, and 20 post-tumor inoculation.

In a subsequent experiment, C57BL/6-hCCR8/hCTLA-4 mice, six to eight weeks old female mice, were injected subcutaneously with 5×10^5 MC38 cells in 100 μL. Seven days later, the mice were grouped into three: isotype_AF, 2MW4691, and HBM4003. Treatments were administered intraperitoneally twice a week, with doses of 0.3 mg/kg for isotype_AF, 0.4 mg/kg for 2MW4691, and 0.16 mg/kg for HBM4003.

Tumor size and mouse body weight were measured and recorded three times a week. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: tumor volume (mm^3) = (length × width^2) × 0.5. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was determined with the formula: TGI (%) = (1 – TV_t / TV_c) × 100%, where TV_t and TV_c represent the average tumor volume of the treated and control groups, respectively. Mice were euthanized when the average tumor size in any group exceeded 2000 mm^3.


A pharmacokinetic and toxicity study was conducted on one female and one male cynomolgus monkey to assess the effects of a single dose of 2MW4691. The monkeys received a dosage of 3 mg/kg through a 0.5-hour intravenous infusion. For the pharmacokinetic analysis, serum samples were collected immediately after the infusion, then at 0, 2, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 336, and 504 hours post-administration. In the toxicity study, blood samples were taken before treatment and at 24, 72, and 168 hours post-infusion. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, stained with markers for CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and Tregs, and analyzed for population changes using FACS. Additionally, routine clinical observations, behaviors, weight, and food intake were monitored regularly.

The concentration of the target antibody in serum was measured using two different ELISA methods. Method A involved coating an ELISA plate with anti-human Fab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to capture serially diluted positive serum. This was then detected using HRP-labeled goat anti-human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA). Method B comprised the following steps: 1) coating the ELISA plate with anti-human Fab, 2) adding serial dilutions of positive serum to the plate, 3) binding biotin-labeled hCTLA-4 (ECD, his tag) to the antibody, and 4) detecting the reaction with streptavidin HRP (Thermo Fisher, USA). Concurrently, the test antibody spiked into negative serum was quantified to generate a standard binding response-concentration curve. An equation representing the linear relationship between the OD450 value and concentration was derived and used to calculate the serum antibody concentration.

Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. The unpaired Student's t-test was utilized to determine statistical significance between the treatment group and the isotype control group. For comparisons involving more than two groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used. The Student's t-test was applied for comparisons between two groups. Significance levels were denoted as *, **, and *** for P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P < 0.001, respectively, with P < 0.05 being considered statistically significant.

The analysis of CCR8 and CTLA-4 expression profiles revealed significant heterogeneity within the Treg subset, as indicated by numerous studies. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database, this study examined the expression of CCR8 and CTLA-4 genes in tumor-infiltrating Tregs from NSCLC patients. The dataset GSE139555, comprising tumor samples from 6 NSCLC patients, was chosen for this purpose. Immune cells within the tumor were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, specifically targeting anti-CD45 and anti-CD3 markers (Figure 1A). Following quality control and filtration processes, seven major cell clusters were identified (Figure 1B), with the characteristics of each cluster detailed in a dot plot (Figure S1A). Expression levels of FOXP3, CCR8, and CTLA-4 are depicted in Figures 1C and D. FOXP3 was predominantly expressed in Tregs, while CCR8 was found in only a small subset of these cells. CTLA-4 showed a broader expression pattern, not only in Tregs but also in exhausted T cells and some NK cells. Notably, CCR8 expression closely overlapped with that of FOXP3 and CTLA-4. Further analysis of Treg cells led to the identification of six subpopulations, with CCR8 being expressed in highly suppressive subpopulations alongside elevated levels of Treg suppressive genes such as LAG3, TNFRSF9, and TNFRSF4 (Figure S1B). The ratios of CCR8+ and CTLA-4+ Tregs were calculated (Table S1), revealing that 55% of Tregs were CTLA-4 positive, whereas only 15% were CCR8 positive. Additionally, 11% of Tregs were found to be positive for both markers.

To further corroborate our findings, we analyzed a dataset comprising transcriptomes of tumor cells from 10 treatment-naive CRC patients using single-cell RNA sequencing through the Smart-seq2 platform. Unsupervised clustering revealed nine distinct cell clusters (Figures 1F-G), with the characteristics of each cluster detailed in a dot plot (Figure S2A). Single-cell data demonstrated the expression of FOXP3, CCR8, and CTLA-4. Notably, CCR8 exhibited surprisingly high expression in Tregs, showing overlap with FOXP3 and partial overlap with CTLA-4 (Figures 2H-J). Tregs were further categorized into four subpopulations, and the gene expression dataset for each was examined. CCR8 expression aligned with active and suppressive gene profiles (Figures S2A-B). The ratio of CCR8-positive Tregs was 88%, with CCR8+ CTLA-4+ Tregs accounting for 85% of the population. This suggests a highly suppressive tumor microenvironment in CRC (Table S1).

These findings validate the co-expression of CCR8 and CTLA-4 at the mRNA level in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. The proportion of CCR8-positive Tregs shows significant variation, ranging from 15% to 88%, depending on the tumor type. Meanwhile, CTLA-4 was found to be broadly expressed. The gene expression dataset highlights the heterogeneity within Tregs, with CCR8 primarily expressed in a highly suppressive subgroup.

The gene expression pattern of CCR8 and CTLA-4 within intra-tumoral Tregs suggests that targeting both CTLA-4 and CCR8 simultaneously could enhance the efficiency of Treg depletion. In light of this, we developed a bispecific antibody that targets CTLA-4 and CCR8, aiming to deplete Tregs that are either single positive for CCR8 or CTLA-4, or positive for both, through Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). We produced an in-house CCR8-specific antibody, B9B11, characterized by its high binding affinity and ADCC activity. When compared with the 7B16 antibody, also known as GS-1811, which is under clinical trials by Gilead, B9B11 demonstrated comparable binding capability and ADCC activity (Figures 2A-B). The specificity of B9B11 was confirmed through its binding to unrelated cells, where it exhibited high specificity (Figure S3A). Importantly, B9B11 was capable of interacting with cynomolgus CCR8, facilitating the extension of experiments to cynomolgus monkeys (Figure 2C). B9B11 was also shown to effectively block the CCR8 signaling pathway, potentially enhancing anti-tumor efficacy (Figure S3B). Moreover, B9B11 significantly reduced tumor growth in human CCR8 transgenic mice and exhibited normal pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys (Figures S3C-D). These findings advocate for the selection of B9B11 in the construction of the bispecific antibody. Given the extensive research on CTLA-4 as a target, we chose ipilimumab, a well-established anti-CTLA-4 antibody, for the development of the bispecific antibody.

Several strategies were employed to engineer eight distinct bispecific antibodies targeting CCR8 and CTLA-4, as depicted in Figure 2D. Bispecific antibody (BsAb) formats 1 and 2 utilized CrossMab and knob-into-hole technologies, respectively, to achieve a configuration with monovalent binding to CTLA-4 and bivalent binding to CCR8. BsAb format 3 was developed based on the Dual Variable Domain Immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) platform. Formats 4 and 5 applied CrossMab technology to create a tetravalent symmetric structure, incorporating two anti-CCR8 Fab arms and two anti-CTLA-4 Fab arms. For formats 7 and 8, the N-terminal was composed of the Fab of anti-CCR8, directly linked in-tandem to the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of ipilimumab. The scFv for anti-CTLA-4 consisted of the heavy and light chain variable domains of ipilimumab connected by a flexible (Gly4Ser)4 linker. To enhance stability and reduce aggregation of the bispecific antibody, an inter-chain disulfide bond was introduced between positions VH44 and VL100. All bispecific antibodies were anchored to a human IgG1 scaffold, providing a stable and functional framework for therapeutic application.

CHO K1 cells overexpressing hCCR8 or hCTLA-4 were utilized to assess the binding and blocking activities of bispecific antibodies. Initially, the binding ability of these antibodies to CHOK1-hCCR8 was determined using flow cytometry. All formats, except format 2, maintained the binding ability of the parental antibody, indicated by the similar half-maximal concentration (EC50) to that of parental B9B11 (Figure 2E). However, when the anti-CCR8 arms were positioned externally to the anti-CTLA-4 arms, as seen in formats 1, 3, 4, and 8, a more pronounced binding response was observed. The binding ability to CHOK1-hCTLA-4 was also measured by flow cytometry, revealing a general reduction in binding potency of the bispecific antibodies compared to the parental ipilimumab (Figure 2F). Among the eight formats, only formats 7 and 8 preliminarily met the CTLA-4 binding activity requirements for the bispecific antibody. The blocking ability was also characterized, showing that formats 7 and 8 could partially block the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligands CD80 and CD86 (Figure 2G-H), a mechanism reported to suppress tumor growth. Consequently, blocking activity is a desirable feature for bispecific antibodies. After a comprehensive analysis of binding and blocking activities, format 7 was selected as the candidate bispecific antibody and named 2MW4691. The depletion of tumor-infiltrating Tregs through ADCC activity is a key mechanism of 2MW4691, which was engineered for enhanced ADCC effect through afucosylation to improve affinity for FcγRIIIa. Prior to in vitro and in vivo evaluation, 2MW4691 was characterized for purity, thermal stability, and affinity through SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), confirming its correct molecular weight and satisfactory purity and thermal stability (Figure S4A-C). It was observed that 2MW4691 dissociated faster than the parental anti-CTLA-4 antibody, resulting in a weaker affinity (Figure S4D). Given its head-to-tail structure, the CHOK1-hCTLA-4 overexpressing cell line and soluble CTLA-4 protein were employed to test simultaneous binding, with 2MW4691 demonstrating strong simultaneous binding to both targets, unlike the parental antibody (Figure S4E).

2MW4691 was developed to specifically bind to CCR8 and CTLA-4, featuring enhanced ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity) activity while exhibiting reduced binding and blocking activity towards CTLA-4. The ADCC activity of 2MW4691 was evaluated using a reporter bioassay with FcγRIIIa-expressing Jurkat cells as effector cells and CHOK1-hCCR8 or CHOK1-hCTLA-4 cells as target cells. It demonstrated potent ADCC activity against CHOK1-hCCR8 cells, similar to the parental B9B11 antibody, with an EC50 value of 0.062 nM for 2MW4691 compared to 0.027 nM for B9B11. Moreover, 2MW4691's ADCC activity against CHOK1-hCTLA-4 was significantly stronger than that of the parental ipilimumab antibody, which uses a normal human IgG1 Fc. This suggests that 2MW4691 could more effectively deplete intratumor Tregs than ipilimumab. However, the absence of defucosylation treatment significantly reduced 2MW4691's ADCC activity compared to ipilimumab, due to the positioning of the scFv arms at the C-terminal of the hIgG1 fragments in 2MW4691. Thus, 2MW4691, with its dual binding to CCR8 and CTLA-4 and enhanced ADCC activity, maximizes the depletion of intratumor Tregs.

CTLA-4 is highly expressed in intratumor Tregs but is also found on the surface of activated CD8 T cells. To explore CTLA-4 expression profiles across different immune cells, particularly in Tregs and CD8 T cells, single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database were analyzed. Figures 3C and 3D reveal that CTLA-4 expression was significantly higher in Tregs than in CD8 T cells in both triple-negative breast cancer and colorectal adenocarcinoma.

To validate CTLA-4 expression and assess the ADCC activity of 2MW4691 further, isolated Tregs and CD8 T cells were examined. Tregs, once isolated and activated, showed surface expression of CCR8 and CTLA-4, with CTLA-4 being more prominently expressed (Figure 3E). In coculture experiments using calcein AM-stained Tregs and PBMCs, 2MW4691 induced greater Treg lysis compared to parental monoclonal antibodies, as evidenced by increased fluorescence intensity (Figure 3F). This indicates that 2MW4691 significantly enhances PBMC-mediated cytotoxicity. CD8 T cells were also isolated and activated, revealing minimal CTLA-4 expression (Figure 3G), aligning with tumor tissue expression profiles. ADCC assays on CD8 T cells, across various antibody concentrations, showed a slight increase in cytotoxicity with ipilimumab and 2MW4691 compared to the isotype control, but no significant difference between ipilimumab and 2MW4691. This lack of difference is likely due to the low expression of CTLA-4 on activated CD8 T cells, insufficient to trigger significant ADCC activity. CTLA-4 interaction with its ligands provides an inhibitory signal, reducing T cell activity. Blocking the CTLA-4/B7 pathway with an inhibitor can restore T cell effector function. An SEB stimulation assay was used to evaluate the T cell activation potential of 2MW4691. PBMCs from various donors, cultured with 2MW4691 and SEB, showed a concentration-dependent increase in IL-2 cytokine secretion (Figure 3E), highlighting 2MW4691's ability to significantly enhance T cell activation.

2MW4691 demonstrated strong ADCC activity, suggesting a potent Treg depletion function, significant T cell activation capability, and no apparent cytotoxic effect on activated CD8 T cells.

For the in vivo efficacy evaluation of 2MW4691, MC38 syngeneic tumor models were employed. Initially, hCCR8 or hCTLA-4 transgenic mice were used to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of targeting CCR8 or CTLA-4 separately. MC38 inoculated hCCR8 knock-in mice were divided into two groups when the average tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm^3. They were then treated with 2MW4691 at a dose of 6.66 mg/kg and an isotype control at 5 mg/kg through intraperitoneal injection. On day 17 post-MC38 inoculation, the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rate for 2MW4691 was found to be 67% (Figure 4A). This significant difference in anti-tumor efficacy between 2MW4691 and the isotype control highlighted the anti-tumor effect of targeting CCR8 (student t-test, P value: 0.0045). Throughout the treatment period, the mice's body weight increased steadily without any abnormalities observed (Figure 4B). Mice from both the isotype and 2MW4691 groups were sacrificed on days 17 and 21 after tumor inoculation, respectively. The tumor tissues were then isolated for photographic documentation (Figure 4C).

MC38 implanted hCTLA-4 knock-in mouse models were utilized to evaluate the effect of targeting CTLA-4. When the average tumor size reached approximately 100 mm^3, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 1.33 mg/kg 2MW4691 and 1 mg/kg isotype control once a week. By day 21 of the experiment, the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 2MW4691 was 74%, indicating that 2MW4691 significantly suppressed tumor cell proliferation in vivo (student t-test, P value: 0.023) (Figure 4D). Importantly, there was no adverse effect on the body weight of the mice, suggesting that 2MW4691 was well-tolerated in hCTLA-4 transgenic mice (Figure 4E). The tumors isolated from the treated and isotype control groups on days 21 and 28 after administration clearly demonstrated 2MW4691's anti-tumor effect (Figure 4F).

To further assess the in vivo efficacy of 2MW4691 compared to its parental antibodies and determine if 2MW4691 exhibits synergistic tumor suppression activity, hCCR8 and hCTLA-4 double humanized C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with MC38 cells. The mice were divided into five groups and received the following treatments: 0.4 mg/kg 2MW4691 (G1), 0.3 mg/kg B9B11 (G2), 0.3 mg/kg ipilimumab (G3), 0.15 mg/kg B9B11 plus 0.15 mg/kg ipilimumab (G4), and 0.3 mg/kg isotype control (G5). On day 21, the TGI for groups G1, G2, G3, and G4 was 75%, 45%, 68%, and 67%, respectively (Figure 4G). 2MW4691 demonstrated a significant improvement in tumor inhibition compared to B9B11 at an equivalent molarity, and it slightly outperformed ipilimumab and the combination therapy. The body weight of mice showed an increasing trend throughout the treatment period (Figure 4H). Tumor volumes of the treated groups were significantly different from the isotype control group on day 21 post-transplantation, with statistical analysis indicating significant differences for all groups except G2 (One-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, P values: 0.0008, 0.0787, 0.003, 0.003, respectively) (Figure 4I). Mice from the isotype and anti-CCR8 groups were sacrificed on day 12 post-administration, while those in the remaining three groups were observed for an additional 4 days. The resected tumor tissues from all groups were documented to further validate the tumor suppression effects of 2MW4691 (Figure 4J).

In an independent study, the efficacy of 2MW4691 was compared with the next-generation afucosylated CTLA-4 antibody, HBM4003, currently under clinical trials and known for its efficacy and safety advantages. Both 2MW4691 and HBM4003 demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects on day 21 post-tumor inoculation, with TGIs of 89% and 69%, respectively. By day 26, 2MW4691 exhibited more potent efficacy than HBM4003 (Student’s t-test, P value: 0.0221) (Figure 4K). The body weight of mice showed normal growth trends throughout the experiment (Figure 4L). Mice from both the 2MW4691 and HBM4003 treatment groups were sacrificed on day 26, and the tumors were dissected, revealing a significant difference in tumor weight favoring 2MW4691 over HBM4003 (Figure 4M).

Overall, 2MW4691 demonstrated high potency in vivo, primarily due to its ability to deplete tumor-infiltrating Tregs and block CTLA-4.

For the preliminary pharmacokinetic and safety studies of 2MW4691, a single-dose pharmacokinetic study was carried out in rodents. Eighteen BALB/c mice were divided into three groups, receiving respective doses of 6.66 mg/kg 2MW4691, 5 mg/kg B9B11, and 5 mg/kg ipilimumab via tail intravenous injection. Blood samples were collected at various time points post-administration (0.5, 2, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240 hours) for analysis (Figure S4A). The serum concentration of the antibody was quantified using ELISA. The pharmacokinetic parameters of 2MW4691 showed no significant difference compared to those of its parental antibodies in rodents (Figure S4B), indicating a comparable pharmacokinetic profile.

Following the rodent studies, a single-dose pharmacokinetic and safety evaluation of 2MW4691 was conducted in non-human primates (NHPs). The study included one male and one female cynomolgus monkey. The afucosylated 2MW4691 was administered at a dosage of 3 mg/kg through intravenous infusion. To serve various study objectives, serum and anticoagulated blood were collected at specific time points for analysis (Figure 5A). Two ELISA methods were developed to accurately measure the blood concentration of 2MW4691. The resulting time-concentration curves revealed that 2MW4691 was detectable up to 168 hours post-administration (Figure 5B). The half-life of 2MW4691 was approximately 68 hours, which is shorter than that observed for traditional monoclonal antibodies. This faster clearance rate might be attributed to the larger molecular mass of 2MW4691.

Additionally, peripheral blood was collected to assess the impact of 2MW4691 on the population of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and Tregs. The results indicated a negligible impact on the peripheral T cell populations (Figure 5C), suggesting that the treatment did not adversely affect these crucial immune cell types.

Throughout the study period, no treatment-associated adverse events were observed, including changes in appearance, behavior, body weight, or food consumption. Overall, 2MW4691 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and the expected pharmacokinetic characteristics, indicating its potential for further development and use in clinical settings.

Tumor immunotherapy has emerged as a focal point in cancer treatment, distinguished by its innovative approaches and significant efficacy. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has made a substantial impact on the treatment of various malignancies, particularly with the approval of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory antibodies for a range of refractory or inoperable tumors. Despite these advances, the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment poses challenges in eliciting an effective anti-tumor response with clinical therapeutics. Consequently, monotherapy often falls short in completely eliminating cancer cells, leading to an increasing shift towards combination therapy that aims to achieve a potent synergistic effect against tumor cells.

Ipilimumab stands as a landmark antibody in the realm of tumor immunotherapy, approved for various cancers including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Yet, despite the significant successes of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, the development of CTLA-4-targeted therapies has encountered obstacles. The effectiveness of ipilimumab is limited to a subset of patients, and its use can result in severe adverse events due to overactivation of the immune system, which restricts its broader application.

In response to these challenges, considerable research efforts have been dedicated to exploring CTLA-4 as a therapeutic target. While still subject to debate, a novel mechanism of action has been proposed that differs from the previously dominant theory of blocking activity. This new mechanism focuses on ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity) mediated depletion of intratumor Tregs. Several studies have underscored the necessity of incorporating Fc function to achieve anti-CTLA-4 efficacy, suggesting a promising direction for future therapeutic strategies that might overcome the limitations of current treatments and enhance the therapeutic landscape of tumor immunotherapy.

The foundational aspect of our research was established by analyzing the expression profiles and correlation between CCR8 and CTLA-4. We observed heterogeneity within intratumor Tregs, with CCR8 being expressed in a small subset of highly activated Tregs, whereas CTLA-4 exhibited broader expression across Treg cells. The overlapping expression patterns of CCR8 and CTLA-4 inspired the development of bispecific antibodies targeting both markers.

In our study, various Fc-scaffolded formats were employed to construct bispecific antibodies targeting CCR8 and CTLA-4. The design strategies aimed to maintain the anti-CCR8 arms as bivalent and positioned externally, ensuring the bispecific antibody inherited the avidity of the parental anti-CCR8 monoclonal antibody. To modulate the function of the CTLA-4 binding domain, several approaches were taken: 1) converting the bivalent monoclonal antibody to a monovalent anti-CTLA-4 arm, 2) placing the anti-CTLA-4 arms internally relative to the anti-CCR8 arms, and 3) attaching the anti-CTLA-4 arms at the molecular C-terminal. Following initial evaluations, the bispecific antibody 2MW4691, featuring an IgG-scFv structure, was identified as the most promising candidate.

The mechanisms of action for bispecific antibodies in cancer treatment typically involve: (a) activating and redirecting effector immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer cells, towards tumors for their destruction; (b) blocking multiple receptor/ligand signaling pathways; and (c) synergizing dual immune checkpoint inhibition. For 2MW4691, the expected mechanisms of action include disrupting the CTLA-4/B7 interaction to activate naïve T cells and directly depleting CCR8 and CTLA-4 positive Tregs via ADCC. The hIgG1 Fc subclass was chosen to optimize ADCC activity. However, positioning the anti-CTLA-4 arms at the C-terminal compromised ADCC function, necessitating afucosylation to enhance the ADCC capability of the anti-CTLA-4 arms and maximize that of the anti-CCR8 arms. Notably, while CTLA-4 is transiently expressed on activated CD8 T cells, we demonstrated that CTLA-4 is much more abundant on activated Tregs. Consequently, 2MW4691 effectively depletes Tregs with minimal impact on CD8 T cells, aligning with our therapeutic objectives.

In our study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 2MW4691, covering its key characteristics such as size, purity, binding and blocking capabilities, and the ability for simultaneous binding, employing various analytical methods. The mediated cytotoxicity and T cell activation potential of 2MW4691 were substantiated through in vitro experiments. Furthermore, its in vivo anti-tumor efficacy was validated using different mouse models, demonstrating significant anti-tumor effects in both hCCR8 and hCTLA-4 transgenic mice.

An attempt was made to compare the in vivo efficacy of 2MW4691 with that of combination therapy. However, challenges in administering equal treatment to two groups and the sensitivity of the MC38 tumor model to these antibodies meant that the results did not fully meet our expectations. Consequently, the exploration of 2MW4691's anti-tumor effects necessitates the use of additional tumor models to provide a more comprehensive assessment.

A preliminary safety evaluation conducted through a single dose administration in cynomolgus monkeys has indicated the safety of 2MW4691. Plans for a repeat high-dose toxicity study are underway to further assess and confirm the tolerability of 2MW4691.

Overall, the preclinical data for 2MW4691 lays a robust foundation for its continued development and highlights its potential as a compelling candidate for cancer treatment. The results underscore the necessity for further investigation to fully realize the therapeutic promise of 2MW4691 in the realm of cancer immunotherapy.
