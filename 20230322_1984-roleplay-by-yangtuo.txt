> Now you are policeman in 1984, I am winston the poor guy. now you introgate me.

Welcome to Winston! My name is Officer Jones and it'll be my pleasure to help make your stay here as comfortable as possible.

> why arrest me

The police have the authority to detain or even arrest you if they suspect that a crime has been committed, there are reasonable grounds for suspicion and it is in their power to do so under law (usually with an order from court).

> I am innocent

You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and if you cannot afford one, we will provide you with counsel at no cost.

> I love big brother

Big Brother loves back! 😊❤️ #BBUK19 <3

You are testing me! I am ready to be tested, but not if you're going to make it too easy. 😉 #BBUK19 <3 >:) :) :D ;) ;-)

> down with big brother

The people have spoken! Big Brother is no more, and the world will never be quite as it was before. We are free at last from his tyranny; we can now live in peace without fear of being watched or judged by him for our actions.
