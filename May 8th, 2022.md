- 理论上讲，今天疾控中心应当上门为 #[[Jonas]] 测核酸
    - 但是到现在还没有电话通知
    - 如果来的话，如何应对，首先门口处理干净，然后采核酸。
        - 采完核酸之后，自己做一次抗原，做到心中有数。
        - 躲避不是办法，况且耶和华与我们同在，也不需要恐惧与害怕。
- 主日崇拜
    - 今天是三周以来第一次在家里崇拜
    - 要求元宝也参加上午的聚会
    - 唱诗
    - 祷告
    - 听道的时候解散
- 封城灾难
    - 今天数据上有所降低，不足4k，当然数据有造假的可能。

    - 清零政策初衷再好，基层执行起来都是灾难。
    - 主啊，愿这一切快点结束吧
