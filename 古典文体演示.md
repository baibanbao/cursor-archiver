                - Headnote:Thucydides has views - of human nature, religion, the unreliability of the mob, and the inevitable degeneration of democracy - that he means his reader to come to share, but he takes the stand that, far from arguing, he is simply presenting things as they are to a reader who, like him, has a classic mind. He is the original master of the classic feat of presenting his interpretations, evaluations, and judgments as if they are specific, hard, visible facts no different from the many facts that surround them.

                - In this way the public funeral was conducted in the winter that came at the end of the first year of the war. At the beginning of the following summer the Peloponnesians and their allies, with two-thirds of their total forces as before, invaded Attica, again under the command of the Spartan King Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamas. Taking up their positions, they set about the devastation of the country.
                - They had not been many days in Attica before the plague first broke out among the Athenians. Previously attacks of the plague had been reported from many other places in the neighbourhood of Lemnos and elsewhere, but there was no record of the disease being so virulent anywhere else or causing so many deaths as it did in Athens. At the beginning the doctors were quite incapable of treating the disease because of their ignorance of the right methods. In fact mortality among the doctors was the highest of all, since they came more frequently in contact with the sick. Nor was any other human art or science of any help at all. Equally useless were prayers made in the temples, consultation of oracles, and so forth; indeed, in the end people were so overcome by their sufferings that they paid no further attention to such things.
                - The plague originated, so they say, in Ethiopia in upper Egypt, and spread from there into Egypt itself and Libya and much of the territory of King of Persia. In the city of Athens it appeared suddenly, and the first cases were among the population of Piraeus, where there were no wells at that time, so that it was supposed by them that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the reservoirs. Later, however, it appeared also in the upper city, and by this time the deaths were greatly increasing in number. As to the question of how it could first have come about or what causes can be found adequate to explain its powerful effect on nature, I must leave that to be considered by other writers, with or without medical experience. I myself shall merely describe what it was like, and set down the symptoms, knowledge of which will enable it to be recognized, if it should ever break out again. I had the disease myself and saw others suffering from it.
                - That year, as is generally admitted, was particularly free from all other kinds of illness, though those who did have any illness previously all caught the plague in the end. In other cases, however, there seemed to be no reason for the attacks. People in perfect health suddenly began to have burning feelings in the head; their eyes became red and inflamed; inside their mouths there was bleeding from the throat and tongue, and the breath became unnatural and unpleasant. The next symptoms were sneezing and hoarseness of voice, and before long the pain settled on the chest and was accompanied by coughing. Next the stomach was affected with stomach-aches and with vomitings of every kind of bile that has been given a name by the medical profession, all this being accompanied by great pain and difficulty. In most cases there were attacks of ineffectual retching, producing violent spasms; this sometimes ended with this stage of the disease, but sometimes continued long afterwards. Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor was there any pallor: the skin was rather reddish and livid, breaking out into small pustules and ulcers. But inside there was a feeling of burning, so that people could not bear the touch even of the lightest linen clothing, but wanted to be completely naked, and indeed most of all would have liked to plunge into cold water. Many of the sick who were uncared for actually did so, plunging into the water-tanks in an effort to relieve a thirst which was unquenchable; for it was just the same with them whether they drank much or little. Then all the time they were afflicted with insomnia and the desperate felling of not being able to keep still.
                - In the period when the disease was at its height, the body, so far from wasting away, showed surprising powers of resistance to all the agony, so that there was still some strength left on the seventh or eighth day, which was the time when, in most cases, death came from the internal fever. But if people survived this critical period, then the disease descended to the bowels, producing violent ulceration and uncontrollable diarrhoea, so that most of them died later as a result of the weakness caused by this. For the disease, first settling in head, went on to affect every part of the body in turn, and even when people escaped its worst effects, it still left its traces on them by fastening upon the extremities of the body. It affected the genitals, the fingers, and the toes, and many of those who recovered lost the use of these members; some, too, went blind. There were some also who, when they first began to get better, suffered from a total loss of memory, not knowing who they were themselves and being unable to recognize their friends.
                - Words indeed fail one when one tries to give a general picture of this disease; and as for the sufferings of individuals, they seemed almost beyond the capacity of human nature to endure. Here in particular is a point where this plague showed itself to be something quite different from ordinary diseases: though there were many dead bodies lying about unburied, the birds and animals that eat human flesh either did not come near them or, if they did taste the flesh, died of it afterwards. Evidence for this may be found in the fact that there was a complete disappearance of all birds of prey: they were not to be seen either round the bodies or anywhere else. But dogs, being domestic animals, provided the best opportunity of observing this effect of the plague.
                - These, then, were the general features of the disease, though I have omitted all kinds of peculiarities which occurred in various individual cases. Meanwhile, during all this time there was no serious outbreak of any of the usual kinds of illness; if any such cases did occur, they ended in the plague. Some died in neglect, some in spite of every possible care being taken of them. As for a recognized method of treatment, it would be true to say that no such thing existed: what did good in some cases did harm in others. Those with naturally strong constitutions were no better able than the weak to resist the disease, which carried away all alike, even those who were treated and dieted with the greatest care. The most terrible thing of all was the despair into which people fell when they realized that they had caught the plague; for they would immediately adopt an attitude of utter hopelessness, and, by giving in this way, would lose their powers of resistance. Terrible, too, was the sight of people dying like sheep through having caught the disease as a result of nursing others. This indeed caused more deaths than anything else. For when people were afraid to visit the sick, then they died with no one to look after them; indeed, there were many houses in which all the inhabitants perished through lack of any attention. When, on the other hand, they did visit the sick, they lost their own lives, and this was particularly true of those who made it a point of honour to act properly. Such people felt ashamed to think of their own safety and went into their friends' houses at times when even the members of the household were so overwhelmed by the weight of their calamities that they had actually given up the usual practice of making laments for the dead. Yet still the ones who felt most pity for the sick and the dying were those who had had the plague themselves and had recovered from it. They knew what it was like and at the same time felt themselves to be safe, for no one caught the disease twice, or, if he did, the second attack was never fatal. Such people were congratulated on all sides, and they themselves were so elated at the time of their recovery that they fondly imagined that they could never die of any other disease in the future.
                - A factor which made matters much worse than they were already was the removal of people from the country into the city, and this particularly affected the incomers. There were no houses for them, and, living as they did during the hot season in badly ventilated huts, they died like flies. The bodies of the dying were heaped one on top of the other, and half-dead creatures could be seen staggering about in the streets or flocking around the fountains in their desire for water. The temples in which they took up their quarters were full of the dead bodies of people who had died inside them. For the catastrophe was so overwhelming that men, not knowing what would happen next to them, became indifferent to every rule of religion or of law. All the funeral ceremonies which used to be observed were now disorganized, and they buried the dead as best they could. Many people, lacking the necessary means of burial because so many deaths had already occurred in their households, adopted the most shameless methods. They would arrive first at a funeral pyre that had been made by others, put their own dead upon it and set it alight; or, finding another pyre burning, they would throw the corpse that they were carrying on top of the other one and go away.
                - In other respects also Athens owed to the plague the beginnings of a state of unprecedented lawlessness. Seeing how quick and abrupt were the changes of fortune which came to the rich who suddenly died and to those who had previously been penniless but now inherited their wealth, people now began openly to venture on acts of self-indulgence which before then they used to keep dark. Thus they resolved to spend their money quickly and to spend it on pleasure, since money and life alike seemed equally ephemeral. As for what is called honour, no one showed himself willing to abide by its laws, so doubtful was it whether one would survive to enjoy the name for it. It was generally agreed that what was both honourable and valuable was the pleasure of the moment and everything that might conceivably contribute to that pleasure. No fear of god or law of man had a restraining influence. As for the gods, it seemed to be the same thing whether one worshipped them or not, when one saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately. As for offenses against human law, no one expected to live long enough to be brought to trial and punished: instead everyone felt that already a far heavier sentence had been passed on him and was hanging over him, and that before the time for its execution arrived it was only natural to get some pleasure out of life.
                - This, then, was the calamity which fell upon Athens, and the times were hard indeed, with men dying inside the city and the land outside being laid waste. At this time of distress people naturally recalled old oracles, and among them was a verse which the old men claimed had been delivered in the past and which said:
                - War with the Dorians comes, and a death will come at the same time.
                - There had been a controversy as to whether the word in this ancient verse was "dearth" rather than "death"; but in the present state of affairs the view that the word was "death" naturally prevailed; it was a case of people adapting their memories to suit their sufferings. Certainly I think that if there is ever another war with the Dorians after this one, and if a dearth results from it, then in all probability people will quote the other version.
                - Then also the oracle that was given to the Spartans was remembered by those who knew of it: that when they inquired from the god whether they should go to war, they received the reply that, if they fought with all their might, victory would be theirs and that the god himself would be on their side. What was actually happening seemed to fit in well with the words of this oracle; certainly the plague broke out directly after the Peloponnesian invasion, and never affected the Peloponnese at all, or not seriously; its full force was felt at Athens, and, after Athens, in the most densely populated of the other towns.
                - Such were the events connected with the plague. Meanwhile the Peloponnesians, after laying waste the Attic plain, moved on into the Paralian district as far as Laurium, where the Athenian silver-mines are. First they laid waste the side that looks towards the Peloponnese, and then the other side facing Euboea and Andros.

                - 第七章 战争的第二年。雅典的瘟疫。伯里克利的立场和政策。波提狄亚的陷落。
                    - [47] 以上就是在这一年的冬季里举行的公葬典礼，它是在战争的第一年岁末举行的。在第二年的夏季之初，拉栖代梦人和他们的同盟者，像从前一样，用他们全部军队的 三分之二侵入阿提卡，宙西达姆斯之子，拉栖代梦之王，阿奇达姆斯担任全军指挥官。他们安营扎寨后，便开始蹂躏那个地区。在他们军抵阿提卡之后不久，瘟疫就 首先在雅典人中间发生了。据说，这种瘟疫过去曾在毗邻的列姆诺斯许多地区和其他地方流行过，但是在人们的记忆中从来没有哪个地方的瘟疫像雅典的瘟疫这样严 重，或者伤害过这么多人命。起初，医生们完全不能医治这种疾病，因为他们不知道正确的治疗方法。而医生们自己死亡最多，因为他们和病人接触最频繁。任何人 工技术都没有什么效果。在神庙中祈祷，询问神谶，诸如此类的办法，都无用处，直到最后他们完全为病痛的威力所征服，他们也不再求神占卜了。
                    - [48] 据说，这种瘟疫起源于埃及上方的埃塞俄比亚的一些地方，由那儿传布到埃及和利比亚，以及波斯国王的大部分领土内。瘟疫突然在雅典出现，首先得这种病的是比 雷埃夫斯的居民。他们以为是伯罗奔尼撒人在蓄水池中施放了毒药，那时比雷埃夫斯还没有水井。随后这种病在上城也出现了。这时，死亡人数激增。至于这种病是 如何起源的，其发病原因是什么，造成如此巨大的精神痛苦的种种原因，我将留给其他的作家去考虑，不管他们是业余的还是职业的作家。就我本人而言，我将扼要 地记载这种现象，描述它的症状，如果 可能是公元前431年年底，或是前430年之初。
                    - 在雅典发生的瘟疫是现在已知的病症中的哪一种，目前尚难以确定。学者们曾经提出种种推测，认为是天花、麻疹、斑疹、伤寒，甚至是突发性中毒综合征等。
                    - 埃及上方应指埃及以南的地区，不是"上埃及"。指雅典城。雅典人习惯把与雅典城连为一体的比雷埃夫斯称为下城。
                    - 以后再发生这种病，学者们也许会对它有所认识。这一点我会做得较好，因为我自己患过这种病，也见过别人患过这种病。
                    - [49] 一般人都承认，那一年没有其他特别的病症；极少数患过其他疾病的人，最终也都得了这种病。但是，通常看不出有什么显著的发病原因。健康状况良好的人都是突 然地头部发高烧；眼睛变红，发炎；口腔内喉咙或舌头往外渗血；呼吸不自然，不舒服。在这些症状出现后，便是打喷嚏，嗓子嘶哑；接着就是胸部疼痛，剧烈地咳 嗽；之后，腹部疼痛，呕吐出医生都有定名的各种胆汁，整个发病过程都是很痛苦的。大多数的患者接下去便是干呕，产生强烈地痉挛；有些人抽搐很快就停止了， 有些人则持续很久。皮肤表面的热度不是很高，从外表上看，也没有出现苍白色，皮肤呈红色，青黑色，突然出现小浓包和溃疡。但是身体内部高热难耐，以致患者 连身着最薄的亚麻布衣都难以忍受，所以他们就脱掉全部衣服。他们最喜欢纵身跳人冷水中。事实上，一些没人照顾的病人就是这样做的，他们跳进雨水池中，以消 除他们不可抑制的干渴。但无论他们喝多少水，症状都是一样的。另外，长时间的失眠和焦躁不安也一直困扰着他们。当这种疾病达到最严重的程度时，病人的身体 非但没有衰弱，反而有惊人的力量，能够抵御一切痛苦；因此，大多数病人都是在第7天或第8天由于内部的高热而死亡，这时他们尚有些气力。但是如果患者度过 这个时期，病痛便进入肠道，出现严重的溃烂，并且伴有严重的腹泻，由此使病人气力衰竭，通常都是这样死去了。因为这种疾病从头部发起，进而传遍身体各部 位，一个人纵或幸免于死，其四肢也都留有它的痕迹。这种疾病蔓延至生殖器、手指和脚趾，许多人丧失了这些器官的功能，有些人还丧失了视力。还有一些人，在 他们开始康复的时候，完全丧失了记忆力，他们不知道自己是谁，也不认识自己的朋友了。
                    - [50]这种疾病的实况是难以用语言文字来描述的，它 对人类侵害之沉重，几乎不是人所能忍受的。下面的情况可以最清楚地表明这场瘟疫与所有普通的疾病有所不同。所有攫食人类尸体的鸟兽，或者远离尸体(尽管有 许多尸体横陈着没有被埋葬)，或者由于品尝尸体的肉而死亡。关于这一点，下面的事实可以证明：这类鸟实际上已经绝迹了；在尸体附近或其他地方，已经看不到 这种昭译本为"第7天或第9天"。
                    - 但是，如果要观察瘟疫的影响力，最好是研究一下像狗这一类家养动物，这一点我已提及。
                    - [51] 如果我们省略每个患者的许许多多的特殊现象，那么这些就是这种疾病的一般情况。同时，雅典城里没有流行任何常见疾病；如果有常见疾病发生的话，其结果也将 成为瘟疫。有些人因无人照料而死亡，有些人尽管得到悉心照料，但还是死去了。人们还未能找到一种特效药，因为一种药物对一个患者是有益的，对另一个患者却 是有害的。那些身体强壮的人不见得比身体柔弱的人更能抵抗这种疾病，所有病人都同样地死亡，就是那些在饮食上特别注意提防的人也是一样的。最可怕的是，当 人们知道自己身染这种病时，即陷于绝望之中。他们马上就会丧失一切抵御疾病的力量，使自己成为瘟疫的牺牲品。另外，由于相互看护而染上瘟疫的人，像羊群一 样地死去，这种情景是可怕的。因此而造成的死亡数量最多。一方面，如果他们害怕相互照料，病人便因无人照料而死亡；事实上，由于无人照料，许多人全家都死 光了。另一方面，如果他们冒险去照看病人，其结果也是染疫身亡。对于那些自认为照看病人是一种高尚行为的人们，尤其是这样的。这样的人在荣誉的驱使下不顾 自己的安危，到他们的朋友家里去，朋友的家人终于被垂死者的呻吟搞得精疲力竭，他们已经屈从于瘟疫的力量，不再举行哀悼活动。然而，最同情病人和垂死者的 是那些自己得了瘟疫后来痊愈的人。这些人从亲身经历中知道病痛的情况，并且不再为他们自己担心了，因为从来没有人第二次得这种病的--即使第二次染上这种 病，也不会致死的。这样的人不仅会得到其他人的祝贺，那时候他们自己也得意扬扬，甚至于幻想他们以后无论得了什么疾病，都会转危为安的。
                    - [52] 使雅典人的灾难更加恶化的一个因素是乡村居民涌入城市，新来者对此感受尤为深刻。他们没有房屋住，不得不在一年之中的盛夏季节，住在空气不流通的茅舍中， 大量的人无法遏制地死去了。垂死者的身体互相堆积在一起，半死的人在街道上到处打滚，并且群集于泉水的周围，因为他们想喝水。在他们所居住的神圣场所中， 也充满了死者的尸体，这些人正像他们一样。因为这个灾祸具有压倒一切的力量，致使人们不知道今后会怎么样，使人们对世间 指因相互照料而染疫身亡的。
                    - 英译者用"inmate"一词指家里的居民，除自由民家庭成员以外，事实上还包括奴隶。
                    - 万 事都漠不关心，不管它们是神圣之事还是世俗之事。所有此前所沿用的丧葬仪式，统统被放弃了。他们尽他们能力所及，埋葬死者。许多人缺乏埋葬时所必需的东 西，由于他们的朋友已经死得很多，就采用最伤风败俗的方式来埋葬。有时候，他们来到别人已经做好的火化堆旁，把他们的死者的遗体抛到素不相识的人的柴堆 上，然后点起火来；有时候，他们发现另一个火化柴堆正在燃烧着，他们把自己抬来的尸体放在别人的尸体上，就跑开了。
                    - [53]不仅如此，在其 他方面，由于瘟疫，也开始有了违法乱纪的情况。现在，他们明目张胆地冒险做一些事，这些行为在此前是不敢公开的，而且恰恰是他们不愿意做的。因为他们看 到，命运变化是如此迅速，有些富人突然死亡，那些此前一无所有的人却继承了他们的财产。因此，他们决定迅速花掉他们的金钱，以追求享乐。他们觉得自己的生 命和财富都如同过眼烟云。至于所谓荣誉，没有人愿意遵守它的规则，因为一个人能不能活到享受光荣的名号的时候是很成问题的。但是一般人都承认，既光荣又有 用的东西就是那些现时的享乐，以及所有使人能够得到这种享乐的东西。对诸神的敬畏和人为的法律都不能约束他们了。就前一点而言，他们断定敬神和不敬神是一 样的，因为他们看到所有的人毫无区别地死去；就后一点而言，没有人能够预料他能活到因违法而被推上被告席的时候，相反，他们都觉得，对于他们每个人都宣布 了重要的判决，这项判决正悬在人们的头顶上，他们想在这个判断执行之前，再享受一点人生的乐趣，这也是合乎情理的。
                    - [54]这就是这场灾难的情景，它重重地压在雅典人的身上，雅典城里，死神肆虐，城外田地，惨遭蹂躏。在遭遇灾难的时候，很自然地，他们回忆起过去的神谶。据老年人说，很久以前神谶中有这样一句诗：
                    - 和多利亚人的战争一旦发生，死亡与之俱来。
                    - 关于这句古诗曾经有过争辩。有人说，诗中所用字眼是饥馑(dearth)，而不是死亡(death)。但在目前的情况下，自然是后一种主张占上风了。因为人们要设法 昭译本为"瘟疫与之俱来"。
                    - 使 他们的回忆与目前所遭遇灾难相吻合。但是如果我们以后再与多利亚人发生一次战争，而那次战争又恰好引起饥馑的话，我想人们也许会因此而采取这句诗的另一种 解释了。现在那些知情的人还记得另一个给予拉栖代梦人的神谶。当他们问神，他们是否应当作战的时候，神是这样回答的：如果他们全力以赴作战的话，胜利是属 于他们的，而且神自己也要保佑他们。不难想像，现在所发生的事件与这个神谶的词句是完全相符的。因为伯罗奔尼撒人刚刚入侵阿提卡，瘟疫就爆发了，而且，疫 情从未侵入伯罗奔尼撒(至少是程度有限，不值得关注)，瘟疫流行最严重的是雅典；继雅典之后，就在人口最密集的其他城市中流行。以上就是与瘟疫有关的事 实。
                    - [55]伯罗奔尼撒人在蹂躏了平原地区之后，就向帕拉里亚地区推进，直达劳里昂，即雅典的银矿所在地。他们首先蹂躏了面向伯罗奔尼撒的 一边，接着又蹂躏了面向优波亚和安德罗斯的一切。然而，现在仍居于将军之位的伯里克利和前一次伯罗奔尼撒人来犯时的观点一样，认为雅典人不应该出来和他们 交战。
                    - [56]但是，当入侵者还在阿提卡平原地带没有进入帕拉里亚地区的时候，伯里克利就组织了一支由100艘战船组成的舰队，准备出征伯 罗奔尼撒，这时候已经开赴海上。在船上，他率4000名雅典重装步兵和300名骑士。300名骑士在骑兵运输船上，这是雅典人首次把旧船改造为运输船。开 俄斯和列斯堡派来50艘船也参加了这次远征。当这支雅典军队起航之时，伯罗奔尼撒人还在阿提卡的帕拉里亚地区。他们在伯罗奔尼撒的爱皮道鲁斯登陆后，蹂躏 了它的大部分领土，甚至想突击攻下此城，但未获成功。他们离开爱皮道鲁斯，蹂躏特洛伊曾、哈雷斯和赫尔米奥涅的领土，蹂躏伯罗奔尼撒沿海地区的所有城镇。 然后，他们航行前往拉哥尼亚的滨海城市普拉西埃，他们蹂躏了它的一部分领土，攻陷了这个城市，并且大肆劫掠。之后，他们就回国了。但这时伯罗奔尼撒人已经 撤走，不在阿提卡了。
                    - [57]就在伯罗奔尼撒人在阿提卡和雅典人从事海上远征的整个时期内，在雅典军队中和雅典城内，都不断地有人罹疫身亡。的确，实际上可以肯定地说，伯罗奔尼撒人是因为害怕瘟疫的传染而匆匆撤离的；因为他们从来自雅典城的参阅：T．118。
                    - 逃难者口中得知有关情况，并且也看到雅典人不断地在埋葬死者。但是这次入侵停留在阿提卡的时间比任何一次都要长些，他们在这儿滞留约40天，蹂躏了整个阿提卡地区。

            - The Rats on the Waterfront
            - From Joseph Mitchell, Up in the Old Hotel. New York: Vintage, 1993.
            - The brown rat is an omnivorous scavenger, and it doesn't seem to care at all whether its food is fresh or spoiled. It will eat soap, oil paints, shoe leather, the bone of a bone-handled knife, the glue in a book binding, and the rubber in the insulation of telephone and electric wires. It can go for days without food, and it can obtain sufficient water by licking condensed moisture off metallic surfaces. All rats are vandals, but the brown rat is the most ruthless . . . Instead of completely eating a few potatoes, it takes a bite or two out of dozens. It will methodically ruin all the apples and pears in a grocery in a night. To get a small quantity of nesting material it will cut great quantities of garments, rugs, upholstery, and books to tatters. In warehouses, it sometimes goes berserk . . . One night, in the poultry part of the old Gansevoort Market, alongside the Hudson, a burrow of them bit the throats of over three hundred broilers and ate less than a dozen.

            - Presentation of Place: The Balkans as Strategic Terrain
            - From
            - John Keegan
            - The Second World War. New York: Penguin, 1990, page 142.
            - Headnote: John Keegan is a widely respected British military historian. He is a former Senior Lecturer at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He ordinarily takes a classic stand. In his military histories, he often engages in analysis by presentation, as he does in this passage on the Balkans. His treatment of the Second World War is strongly presentational; it unfolds like a guided tour. All the hard choices involving management of detail and arrangement of material are made silently, so that what is obviously one presentation of a very complex cluster of events seems like an inevitable view of a single thing: the Second World War seen from the obviously correct perspective.
            - "Crossroads of Europe" is a catchphrase designation for the Balkans, conveying little more than unfamiliarity with the region by those who use it. The Balkans, spined and herringboned by some of the highest mountains on the continent, offer few highways, and none deserving to be called a path of conquest. No single power, not even the Roman Empire at its height, has dominated the whole region: cautious generals have consistently declined to campaign there if they could. It has been a graveyard of military operations ever since the Emperor Valerns succumbed to the Goths at Adrianople in 378.

        - The C. Burr Artz Library
        - copyright © Kate O'Leary, 1998. Used with permission.
        - The C. Burr Artz Library in downtown Frederick hides behind a deceptively small facade. Past the circulation desk and magazine racks, straight back, adult fiction is to the right and left, with non-fiction shelves to the far left, then the reference desk on the left, and the card catalog, now a collection of computers, to the right. The mystery section used to be held right before the card catalog but it gets moved around a lot. The non-fiction shelves are interrupted by the microfilm room, and resume with biographies. Young adult fiction is next, opposite study tables and carrels to the right. The children's section continues with books for increasingly younger ages all the way to the back doors of the library. In the back left corner is a large open space for storytellers and puppet shows.
        - My father read to me the day I came home from the hospital, and I spent a considerable part of my childhood reading library books. My mom took my sister and brother and me to the library every few weeks and we would check out ten books each, because that was an easy number to keep track of. I remember getting my own library card, a small upright rectangle of stiff white plastic. My last name had a comma instead of an apostrophe. A few years ago my card was replaced with a credit card sized card made of flimsy plastic and without my name stamped on it. The bar code fell off once and I had to have it replaced.
        - A friend of mine grew up going to a library where children under a certain age couldn't check out certain books, but the only censor I had was my father. I think I might have gotten more upset when certain books disappeared, but with so many left to read it really didn't make a difference. I never read Beverly Cleary or Judy Blume, but I read Little Women three times, The Little Princess, Kidnapped, and all the original Nancy Drew's. I read a collection of E. B. White's novels with my mom, loving The Trumpet of the Swan, and a little puzzled by The Mouse and the Motorcycle. I didn't read Roald Dahl until my sister started reading his books, but if he were still writing I would still be reading him.
        - I hope that my children will feel lucky for being spoiled with books, and I hope they will enjoy reading them for the first time as much as I will enjoy reading them again. There are too many books worth reading to buy them all, so we will be familiar with the local public library. I hope they will love reading enough to pass over whatever incarnation of RL Stine happens to be popular. I don't know whether or not my love of reading was inherited, but it was certainly nurtured. It is more than the difference between illiteracy and literacy. It is the difference between literacy and love.

            - David Bellos, Georges Perec: A Life in Words(London: Harvill, 1993), pages 348-349.
            - Headnote: Ouvroir de Littéature Potentielle (OuLiPo), a private initiative of the French writer and editor Raymond Queneau and a few mathematicians, sounds as if it is a parody of the French Academy. Its sense of fun is a surface feature of an intensely serious effort to "generate" literature by using mathematical concepts. Its crowning success to date is its signal contribution to Georges Perec’s La vie mode d’emploi (1978), which David Bellos translated as Life: A User’s Manual. The passage on OuLiPo from Bellos’s biography of Georges Perec shows a confident and knowing selection from a much larger array of facts. Bellos deftly avoids going down at least a dozen side-paths in his three paragraphs (Surrealism, Pataphysics, Bourbaki, Queneau’s interest in vernacular French, what kind of mathematical concepts can "structure" literature and how, and so on). The passage has some of the virtues of an entry in an ideal reference work, one whose editors pick the best person they can find to write an article and then get out of the way. Because it is not an article generated by an editorial template, it projects a personal authority and a certain informality, as if it were the ideal spontaneous answer of a well-informed friend to whom you addressed a question. "David, what on earth is OuLiPo?"
            - The name OuLiPo stands for Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle, or "Workshop for Potential Literature". The idea arose in 1960 at a ten-day conference at Cérisy-la-Salle, a country estate in the Cotentin, not far from the Normandy beaches, used, like Royaumont, as a cultural center. The conference itself, entitled "Une Nouvelle Défense et Illustration de la Langue Française, " in imitation of Du Bellay’s 1549 manifesto for the enrichment of the French language, was held to honor [Raymond] Queneau for his long efforts on behalf of néo-français–"French as she is spoke"–a campaign crowned by the popular success of Zazie in the Metro (1959). What emerged from Cérisy-la-Salle was a group intent on the further study of a different aspect of Queneau’s achievement: the overlap between, or intersection of, mathematics and poetry. The first meeting of the group was held in Paris in November 1960; soon after, members began convening for an irreverent monthly lunch party, with huge ambitions.
            - The founding group consisted mostly of writers and mathematicians. Not all the writers could do mathematics, and not all of the mathematicians (Claude Berge, François Le Lionnais, for example) were writers. Some early members (Ross Chambers and Albert-Marie Schmidt) were literary historians, and some (notably Latis, but also Queneau and Le Lionnais) were Pataphysicians. There were fewer than a dozen of them to begin with. Under Queneau’s guidance they undertook a vast programme of investigation into the formal devices used by writers over the centuries ("analytic OuLiPo") and into the literary potential of patterns that could be cannibalised from formal languages such as mathematics, logic, computer science, and–why not?–chess ("synthetic OuLiPo"). OuLiPo was not a sect, or a chapel, or a campaign for an "ism"; indeed it was not really a writers’ group at all. It was a research team that aimed to fashion new tools for writing and to refurbish old and forgotten ones. Its operational model was Bourbaki, the group of anonymous French mathematicians who had reinvented their entire discipline by starting afresh from first principles.
            - Membership in OuLiPo was not secret, as was that of Bourbaki, but it was meant to be confidential. Queneau wished to create something quite different from the surrealist movement, which with its infighting and public disputes, had hurt him deeply thirty years before. OuLiPo’s constitution stipulates that a member is a member once and for all time. No one can be expelled; deceased members are excused from attendance at meetings but are not allowed to withdraw. (Only by committing hara-kiri at a properly constituted meeting, specifically, explicitly, and exclusively in order to resign, can a member win the right to claim ex-membership. No one has yet taken advantage of this provision of the group’s constitution.)

                - The Role of the Bishop
                - From
                - Jacob Aagard
                - "The Classical Endgame" in Easy Guide to the Panov-Botvinnik Attack. London: Cadogan Books, 1998, page 26.
                - Headnote: The classic writer has no hesitation in using a word or term that does not belong to the diminished vocabulary of Basic English, provided it is the right phrase to use to present what the writer wants to present. The classic writer takes the stand that the reader is competent and the language is sufficent; the reader will already know this perfectly accurate and normal phrase, or, if not, look it up. In the classic stand, the writer is using the phrase not because it is rare or decorative or learned and not to draw attention to either the writer or the prose, but simply because it is the right phrase. A classic writer can present a nuanced technical matter to a highly specialized audience by assuming the classic stand and taking its technical vocabulary for granted as a branch of the language. In this scene, the technical terms do not count as jargon - they are not substitutions for straightforward terms already in the language and their purpose is not to exclude possible audiences while demonstrating the writer's membership in a private tribe. Instead, they are simply the right words, and the reader is competent to know them or learn them.
                - In "The role of the bishop," Aagard takes a thoroughly classic stand to present an extremely narrow technical subject in the game of chess - the role of the bishop in the bishop ending to the classical endgame of the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, which is a strategy for White against the Caro-Kann opening. He is using as his illustration a game in 1995 between Onishchuk and Summerscale, who is the "young Englishman" Aagard mentions.
                - The role of the bishop naturally differs from White to Black. For White there are two important ways of using the bishop. The first one is the natural development square e3, from where it threatens a7 and has the following latent manoeuvre:
                - 26 bishop-b6! rook-d6 27 bishop a5!
                - White takes the d8-square from the queen's rook, and thereby makes the defence of d5 very hard.
                - 27 . . . rook-e8 28 rook-c5 bishop f4!
                - A good decision by the young Englishman (an international master at the time). Defending the pawn would tie down his pieces and almost surely lead to defeat. Instead he gives up the d-pawn, and in return gets his rook to White's second rank.
                - 29 rook-cxd5+ rook-xd5 30 rook-xd5+ rook-e5!
                - After 31 rook-xe5+ bishop-xe5 the black king is ready for the dish of the day.
                - 31 . . . rook-e2 32 bishop-b6 bishop-e5 33 rook-d3
                - Onishchuk believes he is better here, and although he may be right, Black was still able to make a draw by at the right time sacrificing a pawn on the kingside to push the h-pawn.
                - The second role the bishop can play is closely connected to the black d-pawn. Alone or together with the king, it can block the pawn, and at the same time keep an eye on the key squares b4 and a5 on the queenside . . .

                    - Pope Francis as a Classic Stylist
                    - Classic style is modeled on conversation; it is informal, unrehearsed—one person speaking to another no matter what the actual scene and the actual cast may be.
                    - On the evening of 13 March 2013, Jorge Bergoglio stepped out onto a balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square in the Vatican to present himself as the newly elected bishop of Rome, the first pope from the Western Hemisphere, the first Jesuit ever elected to the office, the first pope to adopt the regnal name "Francis."
                    - The new pope was addressing thousands of cheering people he had never seen before in a minutely planned set-piece in front of television cameras and the world press.
                    - The literal scene was about as far from the classic scene as it could be, and yet his speech was classic in every major respect. Pope Francis addressing this large, anonymous and heterogeneous crowd—knowing too that he was being overheard by an audience of indefinite size all over the world— showed himself to be a master of the art of treating the audience, stylistically, as an individual and the scene stylistically, as informal—and a scene of reciprocity as well. The "conversation" was actually a monologue since no one was in a position to respond to his words, but he treated the monologue as conversation, "before your bishop blesses you, I want to ask you for a favor: pray for me."
                    - The core of the speech was a masterpiece of apparent informality, although it was certainly not spontaneous; there wasn't a hesitation, a false start, a syntactic bobble, or an awkward phrase. It was the performance of an accomplished actor playing the role of someone just saying the first thing that came to his mind: "As you know, the cardinals were charged with finding a new bishop for Rome, and it seems as if my brother cardinals went to the ends of the earth to find him, but here I am."
                    - This is talking to a crowd of strangers in a formal, practically a ritual, setting as if you are addressing a casual observation to a friend standing beside you. Only the most accomplished actors can do such a thing with unforced conviction. It is too soon to tell what sort of a pope Francis will turn out to be, but it is already apparent that he is an outstanding master of classic style.

                    - The following is the Vatican's official English translation of Pope Francis' speech `'Urbi et Orbi" delivered in Italian from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica Wednesday night.
                    - Brothers and sisters, good evening!
                    - You know that it was the duty of the Conclave to give Rome a Bishop. It seems that my brother Cardinals have gone to the ends of the earth to get one... but here we are... I thank you for your welcome. The diocesan community of Rome now has its Bishop. Thank you! And first of all, I would like to offer a prayer for our Bishop Emeritus, Benedict XVI. Let us pray together for him, that the Lord may bless him and that Our Lady may keep him.
                    - (Our Father... Hail Mary... Glory Be... )
                    - And now, we take up this journey: Bishop and People. This journey of the Church of Rome which presides in charity over all the Churches. A journey of fraternity, of love, of trust among us. Let us always pray for one another. Let us pray for the whole world, that there may be a great spirit of fraternity. It is my hope for you that this journey of the Church, which we start today, and in which my Cardinal Vicar, here present, will assist me, will be fruitful for the evangelization of this most beautiful city.
                    - And now I would like to give the blessing, but first – first I ask a favor of you: before the Bishop blesses his people, I ask you to pray to the Lord that he will bless me: the prayer of the people asking the blessing for their Bishop. Let us make, in silence, this prayer: your prayer over me.
                    - (...)
                    - Now I will give the Blessing to you and to the whole world, to all men and women of good will. (Blessing)
                    - Brothers and sisters, I leave you now. Thank you for your welcome. Pray for me and until we meet again. We will see each other soon. Tomorrow I wish to go and pray to Our Lady, that she may watch over all of Rome. Good night and sleep well!

            - David Bellos, Georges Perec: A Life in Words(London: Harvill, 1993), pages 11- 12.
            - Headnote: The writer Georges Perec was born in Paris to a family of Polish Jews. His father was killed in action during the German invasion of France in the spring of 1940, when the writer was just a few months past his fourth birthday. His mother was deported and killed at Auschwitz, and his paternal grandfather never made it out of the Jewish neighborhood in eastern Paris where his intrepid wife–who survived the war in an Alpine village with her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson–ran a small grocery store. In gathering information about his family, Georges Perec consulted his aunt Esther who, with her husband, David Bienenfeld, raised him. The following selection from David Bellos’s biography offers a presentation of the writer’s paternal grandparents by considering their relationship to Jewish faith and practice.
            - David Peretz was a traditional Jew and a pious man, an unworldly observer of the Talmud and Torah, of the kind gently mocked in many of I. L. Peretz’s stories of life in the shtetl. It is quite possible that he was a Hasid, or close to the Hasidic movement . . . since his daughter, Esther, when explaining the family background to her nephew in 1967, spoke at some length about what Hasidism was: a cult of joy through prayer and song, a fervently religious branch of orthodox Judaism, intent on achieving spiritual elevation through strict observance of the law. Long after the family had left Poland, when David Peretz was a kindly old man behind the counter of a Paris grocery store, his wife was not keen to leave him in sole charge. He might give away the whole stock of sweets to children who came in and asked for them.
            - [He] . . . was married in 1895. His bride Rojza Walersztejn, was short, dark-haired, energetic, and just sixteen. She became a mother within a year. She held different views from her husband and soon became the family provider, setting up a business to supply timber to local builders. David spent much of his time in prayer rooms but was not allowed to bring his piety into the home: Jewish rites were not observed by Rojza, according to Esther’s later account of her home life in Poland. In fact, if we are to believe a scribbled line opposite Rojza’s name in Perec’s notes, his grandmother refused even to give alms to the poor. Giving alms is the very basis of traditional Jewish social life; you cannot refuse to give alms without making quite a stir in the world in which David and Rojza lived. In the eyes of a Hasid, or an orthodox Jew, refusing to give alms is tantamount to refusing to be Jewish.

                - 《一个数学家的辩白》（英语：A Mathematician's Apology）是一篇由英国数学家G·H·哈代在1940年写成的文章，在当年11月首次出版。这篇文章可以说是哈代本人的自传。哈代从自己的角度，谈论了数学中的美学，给了门外汉一个机会以洞察工作中的数学家的内心。话虽如此，哈代在本书中阐述的观点却只是个人的，他的观点也许不被所有的数学家认同。
                - 这本书1967年的版本由哈代的好友，科学家与文学家C·P·斯诺作序。值得一提的是，斯诺的序几乎比哈代的正文还要长，而且斯诺作序时，哈代已经逝世。[1]
                - 在本书题首，哈代将这本书献给约翰·洛马斯（John Lomas），因为是他要哈代写这本书的。[1]

                - 概述[编辑]
                - 本文用词优美，甚至有几处引用了威廉·莎士比亚的诗文，这与普通的数学家平时所作的论文在语言方面有着大大的不同。不仅如此，从字里行间还可以体会到哈代的一种淡淡的忧伤。
                - 《一个数学家的辩白》尽管有着较强的文学性质，行文却较为杂乱，读者经常会遇到中途转移话题的情况。但总体上说，本文主要围绕这三个主题展开：数学的美，数学的持久性和数学的重要性。
                - 题目[编辑]
                - 在本书的题目中，哈代所使用的“辩白”一词表达的意思是一种正式的辩护或抗辩（就如同柏拉图的《苏格拉底的申辩》），而不是一种对宽恕的恳求，或对获得清白的希冀。
                - 哈代觉得有必要为他一生在数学上的事业作辩解的原因有两个：
                - 第一，62岁的哈代觉得他已经接近衰老（他在1939年曾幸免于一次突发的心脏病），同时，他的数学创造力也在衰退。花时间写这本辩白，意味着哈代认为自己作为一个开创性的数学家的时期已经结束。在C·P·斯诺为该书1967年版所作的序中，他这样描述哈代的这本辩白，“（它）是对曾经所拥有的而现在已经一去不返的创造力的深情挽歌”。用哈代本人的话来说，“解释、评论、鉴赏，是次等工作。作为一个专业的数学家却来写关于数学的东西是悲哀的。数学家的使命在于做些实事，证明新的定理，使数学有所发展，而不是谈论自己或其他数学家做了些什么。
                - 哈代认为自己已经没有能力去积极发展新的数学思想了，他这样写到，“我之所以写关于数学的书是因为，如同其他年过花甲的数学家一样，我已经没有新思维，精力，或者说耐心，去继续有效地做自己的工作。”于是，他觉得自己唯一还能为数学做点贡献的便是写一本探讨数学的书，借以表达自己对这门学科的个人看法。
                - 第二，在第二次世界大战之初，哈代作为一个积极的反战主义者，想为他的信仰——追求、探索数学的目的应当是出于数学的本身价值，而不是出于应用价值——做出辩护。探索数学是为了数学的单纯，为了它内部的完善，为了明晰尚不清楚的概念。他想写本书，向后辈的数学家阐述自己对数学的哲学认识；从数学自身的重要性出发为数学做辩护，详细说明纯数学本身的价值——并不要依赖于应用数学的成果去证明数学的重要性;同时能够激励正在成长中的一代纯数学家。鉴于哈代是一个无神论者，他做出他的辩护是为了勉励他的后继者而不是为了献给上帝。
                - 数学的美[编辑]
                - 本书中一个重要的主题是数学之美。
                - 对于哈代来说，最美的数学应当没有一点在现实世界的应用，也即是他所说的纯数学，尤其是他所钟情的数论。他在为追求纯数学辩解的同时，透露出了他关于纯数学的“无用性”（uselessness）的观点。所谓数学的无用性即是说纯数学不会被滥用而导致伤害。而另一方面，哈代贬低应用数学，甚至将其描述成“丑陋”、“琐碎”和“乏味”的。
                - 值得一提的是，并不是应用数学中概念与定理的实用性使得哈代认为应用数学比纯数学更低一等，而是因为通常来说，这样的数学会有更为普遍的应用。哈代说，是内容的简单与平凡迫使他如此描述应用数学的。根据哈代的定义，这些描述是否被赋予数学中的某一分支是由构成这一分支基础的潜在概念的创造性、深度以及美所决定的。[2]
                - 卡尔·弗雷德里希·高斯曾说过，“数学是科学中的皇后，而数论是数学中的皇后。”哈代教授对高斯这句话的评论则更加强调了这一点。有些人认为是由于数论极端的无应用性才使得高斯做出上述的陈述；然而，哈代指出这并不是主要缘由。就算数论的应用被找到了，也不会有人会因此罢黜这一数学的皇后。哈代认为高斯所想表达的意思是：构成数论的潜在的概念比其它数学分支的更加深刻更加优雅。
                - 在本书中，哈代将数学与绘画和诗歌作类比。他说道，数学家与画家和诗人一样，是模式的创造者。[1] 这一观点与很多人一致，如科学作家艾萨克·阿西莫夫在第三部自传《人生舞台》中也提到这一点。[3]
                - 数学的持久性[编辑]
                - 在第八节中，哈代谈到数学的持久性。他提到，在所有的学科中，数学是最能使人好奇的，因为在其他学科中，真理都没有占据如此重要的位置。后面他总结道，正如历史所证实的，数学成就是最为持久的。接着他举例，巴比伦和亚述文化都衰亡了，汉谟拉比，萨尔贡和尼布甲尼撒都成为了空洞的名字，然而巴比伦的数学仍然是精彩的——巴比伦所创造的60进制仍然在天文学中使用。[1]
                - 数学的重要性[编辑]
                - 在第十一节中，哈代通过数学与国际象棋的比较，说明了数学的重要性（importance）。哈代谈到，一个国际象棋问题的确是数学问题，但却是“琐碎的”（trivial）数学。不管每一步是如何的精巧，都不重要。哈代甚至因为这一言论而受到批评。[4] 在此处，哈代所指的“重要”并不是说某一数学所带来的直接实际作用，而是数学思想所联系的更多更有意义的内容。一个重要的数学发现，会带来一些十分有意义的想法，联系起很多个数学分支中各不相干的内容，还可能会给数学甚至其他的科学带来重大的进步。而象棋，即使是最重要的棋局，也从来都没有带来任何的科学进展。[1]
                - 他同时举了罗尔定理作例子，这个定理虽然在在微积分中具有一定的重要性，但是却不能与莱昂哈德·欧拉与埃瓦里斯特·伽罗瓦等纯数学家工作的优雅和卓越相比。
                - 正如他在他的书中写道的：“就算在数学界，历史也常常玩奇怪的把戏：罗尔在初等微积分中如此地经常出现，就好像他是和牛顿齐名的一个数学家。”[1]
                - “年轻人的游戏”[编辑]
                - 另一个重要的主题是“数学是一个‘年轻人的游戏’”，即是说任何有着数学天赋的人应当趁他们还年轻的时候发展并利用这些天赋，不至于等到中年，数学的创造力开始衰退的时候。
                - 在本书一开始，哈代就写到，“当一个职业数学家发现他自己在写有关数学的东西的时候，他会很悲伤的。”（It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics.）哈代继续解释道，数学家的作用应该是去做一些事情，证明一些新的定理，为数学做些贡献，而不是去谈论他或者其他的数学家已经做过的事情。[1] 在年轻的时候，因为拥有丰富的灵感，数学家都忙于进行数学研究。而当灵感逐渐衰竭之时，数学家才会有时间写一些关于数学的文章而非论文。
                - 哈代还举到艾萨克·牛顿的例子：牛顿在24岁时，即产生了流数与万有引力的想法。而当他50岁时，对数学有了更为深刻的理解，可能是因为一些能力已经消退，却放弃了数学。[5]
                - 这一观点反映出了哈代对他数学能力衰退与日俱增的沮丧。对于哈代，真正的数学本质上应是一种创造的能力，而并非像哈代本人写这本书一样，对数学的阐述或是解释。
                - 正专心致志的写《辩白》之时，哈代承认他作为一个有创造性的数学家的时期已经结束了。正如在本书1967年版的的前言中，斯诺将这本“辩白”称为“对以前属于他的创造力再也不会回来所作的深切的痛惜”。[1]
                - 批评[编辑]
                - 精英主义[编辑]
                - 哈代的思想曾被一战和二战间剑桥大学和牛津大学的学术文化深深地影响。他的猜测——只有每个领域的极好的原创性工作才会有深远持久的价值——在现在听起来是带有精英主义思想的。
                - 哈代在剑桥大学时，曾经加入一个精英协会——剑桥使徒会[6]，这也在一定程度上解释了哈代精英主义思想的来源。
                - 在本书末尾的注解中，哈代教授提起他和洛马斯先生经过特拉法加广场的纳尔逊纪念碑的经历。哈代自己认为，如果自己能够在伦敦有一个纪念碑，会希望这个纪念碑如同纳尔逊纪念碑一样高耸如云，以至于在低端根本看不见；而他猜测，斯诺博士则会希望纪念碑的细节都能够被辨认。这一段话从某种角度上说，正是哈代精英主义的写照。[1]
                - 过时内容[编辑]
                - 现在回顾起来，哈代的一些例子已经过时。譬如说，他写道，“到目前为止，还尚未有人能够发现数论和相对论用于任何与战争有关的目的，而且在今后许多年，也不太可能会有人能够做到这一点。”[1]而在这之后，相对论用以解释核武器为何威力如此巨大，与此同时，数论在公钥加密中起到显著的作用。[7]但是不管怎样，哈代的更加明显的关于美丽的数学发现（关于质数无穷多以及2的平方根的无理性的证明）是无用的的例子仍然是成立的。

                    - Yak编程教育 2017-09-18 18:03:37
                - 引言：哈代主义可以用哈代自己的话如此解释：“我从来没有做过“有用”的工作，我的工作，没有一样对人类的生活，直接或间接，好或坏，有过或将有丝毫的影响。”话的背后，我看见的是一个近乎趾高气昂的哈代，对高奏凯歌的功利主义，发出堂堂的挑衅。这是一颗最热爱真理的心灵，才敢于发出的呐喊，就像希尔伯特说的：“我们必须知道，我们必将知道。”我们为什么要知道？为了知道而知道！
                - 这本书首次出版于1940年，比我们现在看到的这个版本的书籍要早很多。由于看了电影《知者无涯》，我再次阅读此书，真的很值得再阅。现今有关数学的畅销书籍可谓是丰富多彩，琳琅满目。而作者哈代( G.H. Hardy)以其简洁易懂的文章风格脱颖而出。所以我将此书特别推荐给以下读者：想要窥探纯碎数学家的神秘思维并想知道他们对某门学科的真知灼见的人们。
                - G. H. Hardy 哈代（1877 - 1947）因与印度知名数学家Srinivasa Ramanujan的合作而著名（主要因上述电影而被知晓）。在数学界，他因数论和数学分析法的贡献而闻名，其中很多发现是和John Littlewood先生共同提出。
                - （Srinivasa Ramanujan年寿仅33岁，死后在甚至和甘地、尼赫鲁、泰戈尔齐名，被称作“印度之子”，但是无可否认，拉马努金的数学研究，是以神意、真理和自我实现为导向的，从来就不曾想过，为自己的家人或者自己的国家带来什么益处。）
                - 《一位数学家的致歉》是试图证明并解释纯粹数学。在维基百科上，它被描述为一篇关于数学美学的文章，这部分是正确的。这篇文章中最著名的引用是关于哈代的数学观，即数学是一门创造性的艺术，我想许多数学家的观点也是如此：
                - “一个数学家，像一个画家或诗人，是一个图画和模型的创造者。如果他的图案比其他人的更持久，那是因为他们有想法。数学家的图画，就像画家或诗人的，一定要漂亮；观念如同颜色或文字，要有结合在一起的和谐。美是第一位的，丑陋的数学在这个世界是不能长久立住脚的。
                - 但美只是画面的一部分。哈代的文章中最精彩的部分是他定义什么是一个真正伟大的数学结果。以他提出并证明了两个定理为例，一些非数学家也很熟悉的定理：一是有无穷多个质数；二是2 的平方根是无理数（二者都是源于古希腊人）。他指出了这两个定理的不可动摇性和永恒性，在数学史上有着极其深远的意义。第一个定理是算数算法的基础；第二个定理是超出所有数字算法以外的。这两个定理使数学区别于其他领域。他们也不同于数学中其他的定理。
                - 更大意义上说，哈代定义了什么使一个数学结果重要。哈代指出了是普遍性和深度的结合。因在这个数学定理中的想法应在许多不同的数学定理中有用，而且与其他的数学想法都是有关联的。他很精彩的描述数学好像是由不同的“阶层”组成，底层是基本的想法（比如所有的数字），上层是更多相关元素（比如无理数）。一个定理只有和底层相关联，才是有深度的。
                - 数学结果的美和其重要性紧密联系。例如，8712是其逆转数字2178的倍数(8712= 4 x 2178)，这很有趣，但是不会有人说这个结果很重要或很美。但是却有着数学的美学角度。
                - 除了数学的美学的分析，哈代的文章因如何看待数学的实用性而著名，哈代认为数学作为工程师和其他应用科学家使用的工具，实际上是很单调的。真正的“数学”，是“几乎全都没用”，他做了一些大胆惊人的判断。例如，“数学比物理学与现实更直接相关，”而且“纯粹数学明显比应用数学更加有用。”文章中都有详细地阐述。
                - 哈代有关数学用途的观点，什么样的数学是有用的，什么样的数学是没有用的，仍然吸引着我们去探索它的真实性。量子力学和广义相对论的无用论应该是最显著的两个例子。哈代认为理论物理的这些方面几乎和数论一样没有多大用处。他们的发明者是真正的数学家。因为哈代认为真正的数学是没用的。但是只是在当时的那个时代是这样的。然而在当今社会新技术使用了量子力学（例如互联网）和相对论（例如GPS）。 甚至数论的实用性也有很多的争论。相当程度上，在密码学上的应用是得到大家认可的。但哈代自己也承认，随着时间的推移，他的断言可能会改变。然而毫无疑问的是，纯数学家，甚至是理论物理学家，在当时研究和发现这些定理时是没有受实际应用的驱动的。
                - 阅读时是愉快的，但在阅读哈代的文章时也会有时候感觉被冒犯，暗含了性别歧视和剑桥中心—这是时代的产物。文中有点愤世嫉俗（例如：“大多数人什么也做不了”）和傲慢的味道（比如：“不是普通的应用数学家，有点悲哀吗？”）。说是道歉，大多数时候是非常不道歉的。但是，就像哈代自己指出的，他的文章真的是属于半自传式的致歉，试图去辨明他一生的工作，这样也不由的有些主观。然而，这样主观的表达数学也许表达了纯粹数学家好的一面，也使文章变得有趣，让我们清楚的看见纯粹的数学家的方方面面。无论你是否对这个主题感兴趣，作为数学系的学生也好，或者你本人是数学家也罢，都值得一读。
                - 关于作者哈代对他的作品的看法，当他认为自己的人生作为一名数学家活的很值，听到这话你不会惊讶的。但不是没有谦卑：
                - “我从没有做过任何‘有用’的事”... 按照所有的实际标准来判断，我的数学人生的价值简直是零。而且数学之外的世界是琐碎的，我只有一个机会逃避这完全的琐碎与平凡，也许我会被认为创造了一些值得创造的东西。”
                - “Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
                - 世人行动实系幻影。他们忙乱，真是枉然。积蓄财宝，不知将来有谁收取。”—— Psalms 39：6

                - A Mathematician's Apology. [1940] With a foreword by C. P. Snow. Cambridge: University Press, 1967, pages 88-92.
                - Headnote: Given that Hardy begins with a claim, you would think that he is going to offer an argument. Instead, he offers a demonstration that depends upon an appealing grammar of understanding. To present the superiority of serious mathematics over trivial mathematics, he assumes our familiarity with something he takes to be trivial—chess, in this case—and guides us through a piece of serious mathematics. His position is that if he can just show us an example of the best mathematics, it will of course be obvious to us that it is serious in contrast to chess, which, however intricate it may be, is always trivial. He takes the stand that any reader can see the truth of his claim. He is a guide who selects the appropriate proof and walks us through it. The claim is open to many objections and qualifications, but Hardy relies upon a basic premise of classic style: truth does not require argument, just an unobstructed view. The reader may lack that unobstructed view by lacking mathematical training, but this is merely an accidental lack which Hardy will remove by lending us his training.
                - A chess problem is genuine mathematics, but it is in some way "trivial" mathematics. However ingenious and intricate, however original and surprising the moves, there is something essential lacking. Chess problems are unimportant. The best mathematics is serious as well as beautiful—"important" if you like, but the word is very ambiguous, and "serious" expresses what I mean much better.
                - I am not thinking of the "practical" consequences of mathematics. I have to return to that point later: at present I will say only that if a chess problem is, in the crude sense, "useless," then that is equally true of most of the best mathematics; that very little of mathematics is useful practically, and that that little is comparatively dull. The "seriousness" of a mathematical theorem lies, not in its practical consequences, which are usually negligible, but in the significance of the mathematical ideas which it connects. We may say, roughly, that a mathematical idea is "significant" if it can be connected, in a natural and illuminating way, with a large complex of other mathematical ideas. Thus a serious mathematical theorem, a theorem which connects significant ideas, is likely to lead to important advances in mathematics itself and even in other sciences. No chess problem has ever affected the general development of scientific thought; Pythagoras, Newton, Einstein have in their times changed its whole direction.
                - The seriousness of a theorem, of course, does not lie in its consequences, which are merely the evidence for its seriousness. Shakespeare had an enormous influence on the development of the English language, Otway next to none, but that is not why Shakespeare was the better poet. He was the better poet because he wrote much better poetry. The inferiority of the chess problem, like that of Otway's poetry, lies not in its consequences but in its content. . . .
                - It will be clear by now that, if we are to have any chance of making progress, I must produce examples of "real" mathematical theorems, theorems which every mathematician will admit to be first-rate. . . .
                - I can hardly do better than go back to the Greeks. I will state and prove two of the famous theorems of Greek mathematics. They are "simple" theorems, simple both in idea and in execution, but there is no doubt at all about their being theorems of the highest class. Each is as fresh and significant as when it was discovered—two thousand years have not written a wrinkle on either of them. Finally, both the statements and the proofs can be mastered in an hour by any intelligent reader, however slender his mathematical equipment.
                - I. The first is Euclid's proof of the existence of an infinity of prime numbers.
                - The prime numbers or primes are the numbers
                - (A) 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...
                - which cannot be resolved into smaller factors. Thus 37 and 317 are prime. The primes are the material out of which all numbers are built up by multiplication: thus 666 = 2 . 3 . 3 . 37. Every number which is not prime itself is divisible by at least one prime (usually, of course, by several). We have to prove that there are infinitely many primes, i.e. that the series (A) never comes to an end.
                - Let us suppose that it does, and that
                - 2, 3, 5, . . . , P
                - is the complete series (so that P is the largest prime); and let us, on this hypothesis, consider the number
                - Q = (2 . 3 . 5 . . . . .P) + 1
                - It is plain that Q is not divisible by any of 2, 3, 5, ..., P; for it leaves the remainder 1 when divided by any one of these numbers. But, if not itself prime, it is divisible by some prime, and therefore there is a prime (which may be Q itself) greater than any of them. This contradicts our hypothesis, that there is no prime greater than P; and therefore this hypothesis is false.
                - The proof is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absurdum, which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician's finest weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.

            - From
            - John Keegan
            - The Second World War. New York: Penguin, 1990, page 540-541.
            - Headnote: This presentation of Franklin Roosevelt as a war leader concentrates on style and does this partly by contrast: Churchill did this, Hitler did that, but Roosevelt did the other. This is an interpretation, of course, but it advances almost wholly by the deployment of fact. He started work at ten, lunched off a tray, took few calls at night, and so on. The language does not call attention to itself - Keegan is intent on his presentation of Roosevelt - but it is carefully chosen, and the passage ends with a virtuoso dismount. When the reader gets there, he is ready to accept Keegan's interpretation of how Roosevelt directed American strategy - and the New Deal - as if it too is a fact on the same order as what time he started work in the morning and how he had his lunch served.
            - . . . Roosevelt was able to hold aloof from the business of directing war, an activity alien to his temperament. Such an aloofness was not granted to any of the other leaders. Churchill, of course, revelled in high command, dedicated his days (and nights) to war- making, had rooms, suites, even whole houses adapted to his needs as a wartime Prime Minister, preferring his "siren suit" to any other garb (though he also kept handy his uniforms of an honorary colonel of the Cinque Ports Battalion), demanded a constant diet of Ultra intelligence intercepts and lived in hour-to-hour intimacy with his military advisers. Hitler turned himself into a military hermit after the opening of Barbarossa, seeing few but his generals, even though he found their company grating. Stalin's wartime routine conformed strangely in pattern to Hitler's - secretive, nocturnal, troglodyte. Roosevelt scarcely altered the pattern of his life at all after Pearl Harbor. Unthreatened by air attack, he continued to live at the White House, occasionally vacationing at Hyde Park, and there pursued a timetable that drove the methodical and purposeful almost to distraction. [General George C.] Marshall's day was measured to the minute: his only relaxation was to visit his wife in his official quarters for lunch, which was served as he stepped on to the veranda from his staff car. Roosevelt lunched off a tray brought into the Oval Office, did not begin work until ten in the morning and took few telephone calls at night. . . .
            - . . . Unlike Churchill, who was constantly on the move - to Paris (before the fall of France), to Cairo, to Moscow, to Athens (where he spent Christmas Day 1944 while the sound of gunfire between British troops and ELAS rebels rocked the city), to Rome, Naples, Normandy, the Rhine - Roosevelt travelled little. His mobility was, of course, limited by his physical disability, which was the result of poliomyelitis and which a discreet press disguised from its readership almost completely. Nevertheless he travelled when he chose, but during the war his travels took him only to Casablanca in January 1943, Quebec twice (August 1943 and September 1944), Cairo and Tehran at the end of 1944 and Yalta in the Russian Crimea, in February 1945. He saw nothing of the war at first hand, no bombed cities, no troops at the front, no prisoners, no after-effects of battle, and probably did not choose to; he directed American strategy as he had directed the New Deal - by lofty rhetoric and by rare but decisive strikes at the conjunctions of power.

            - From
            - David Bellos, Georges Perec: A Life in Words(London: Harvill, 1993), pages 11- 12.
            - Headnote: The writer Georges Perec was born in Paris to a family of Polish Jews. His father was killed in action during the German invasion of France in the spring of 1940, when the writer was just a few months past his fourth birthday. His mother was deported and killed at Auschwitz, and his paternal grandfather never made it out of the Jewish neighborhood in eastern Paris where his intrepid wife–who survived the war in an Alpine village with her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson–ran a small grocery store. In gathering information about his family, Georges Perec consulted his aunt Esther who, with her husband, David Bienenfeld, raised him. The following selection from David Bellos’s biography offers a presentation of the writer’s paternal grandparents by considering their relationship to Jewish faith and practice.
            - David Peretz was a traditional Jew and a pious man, an unworldly observer of the Talmud and Torah, of the kind gently mocked in many of I. L. Peretz’s stories of life in the shtetl. It is quite possible that he was a Hasid, or close to the Hasidic movement . . . since his daughter, Esther, when explaining the family background to her nephew in 1967, spoke at some length about what Hasidism was: a cult of joy through prayer and song, a fervently religious branch of orthodox Judaism, intent on achieving spiritual elevation through strict observance of the law. Long after the family had left Poland, when David Peretz was a kindly old man behind the counter of a Paris grocery store, his wife was not keen to leave him in sole charge. He might give away the whole stock of sweets to children who came in and asked for them.
            - [He] . . . was married in 1895. His bride Rojza Walersztejn, was short, dark-haired, energetic, and just sixteen. She became a mother within a year. She held different views from her husband and soon became the family provider, setting up a business to supply timber to local builders. David spent much of his time in prayer rooms but was not allowed to bring his piety into the home: Jewish rites were not observed by Rojza, according to Esther’s later account of her home life in Poland. In fact, if we are to believe a scribbled line opposite Rojza’s name in Perec’s notes, his grandmother refused even to give alms to the poor. Giving alms is the very basis of traditional Jewish social life; you cannot refuse to give alms without making quite a stir in the world in which David and Rojza lived. In the eyes of a Hasid, or an orthodox Jew, refusing to give alms is tantamount to refusing to be Jewish.

                    - Headnote: The narrative presentation of Madame Moreau, from the beginning of chapter 23 of La vie mode d’emploi, concentrates heavily on things one can see, making adroit use of lists (of jobs, of tools, of her activities during her active years), while narrating a radical and mysterious movement of the invisible will that transforms a woman who was half of a mom-and-pop enterprise into the formidable head of a major business–a transformation she neither liked nor understood.

It was a very small family business which he had inherited after the 1914-18 war and which he’d run in relaxed prosperity with three cheerful woodworkers at his side whilst she kept the books in big, black-cloth-bound registers with ruled paper and pages she had numbered in violet ink. The rest of the time she led an almost peasant-like existence, busy with the backyard chickens and the kitchen garden, making jams and pâtés.
                    - She’d have done better to sell up and go back to the farm where she’d been born. Rabbits and chickens, some tomato plants, and a couple of beds for lettuces and cabbages–what more did she need? She would have sat by her fireside amongst her placid cats, listening to the clock ticking, to the rain falling on the zinc drainpipes, and the seven-o’clock bus passing by in the far distance; she’d have carried on warming her bed with a warming pan before getting into it, warming her face in the sun on her stone bench, cutting recipes out of La Nouvelle République and sticking them into her big kitchen book.
                    - Instead of that, she had developed, transmogrified, metamorphosed her little business. She didn’t understand why she’d done so. She had told herself it was out of fidelity to her husband’s memory, but he would not have recognized what had become of his old workroom with its smells and shavings: two thousand people, millers, turners, fitters, mechanics, installers, electricians, testers, draftsmen, roughers-out, model- makers, painters, warehousemen, treatment specialists, packers, drivers, delivery men, foremen, engineers, secretaries, publicity writers, commercial agents, and sales reps, making and marketing every year more than forty million tools of all kinds and calibres.
                    - She was tenacious and tough. She rose at five, went to bed at eleven, dealt with all her business in exemplary fashion, punctually, precisely, firmly. She was authoritarian and paternalistic, trusted nothing and nobody save her own intuitions and her own mind; she wiped out all her competitors and took a share of the market larger than anyone had predicted, as if she were mistress of both supply and demand, as if she knew instinctively, on launching each new product, where the real opportunities lay.
                    - Up until the last few years, until age and illness virtually confined her to her bed, she had divided herself tirelessly between her factories in Paris and Romainville, her offices in Avenue de la Grande Armée, and this luxury flat which was so unlike her. She inspected the shopfloors at a gallop, terrorised accountants and typists, insulted suppliers who didn’t keep delivery dates, and chaired Board Meetings energetically and inflexibly, making all heads bow when she opened her mouth.
                    - She hated it all. Whenever she could tear herself away, even for only a few hours, she went to Saint-Mouezy. But her parents’ old farm had gone to ruin. Weeds grew wild in the orchard and vegetable garden; the fruit trees no longer produced. Damp was eating the walls, unsticking the wallpaper, warping the doorframes.
                    - Madame Trévins would help her to light a fire in the fireplace, open the windows, and air the mattresses. She who had four gardeners at Pantin to tend the lawns, flowerbeds, bushes, and hedges surrounding the works couldn’t even manage to find a local man to keep an eye on the garden. Saint-Mouezy, which used to be a sizable little market town, was now a mere juxtaposition of houses restored as second homes, empty all week and chock-full on Saturdays and Sundays with townsfolk who, as they brandished their Moreau hand-drills, their Moreau circular saws, their Moreau portable work-benches, their Moreau all-purpose ladders, laid bare old beams and old stone, hung coachlamps, and rallied to the attack on barns and cartstalls.
                    - Then she would come back to Paris, don her Chanel two-pieces, and for her wealthy foreign customers would give lavish dinners served in crockery designed especially for her by the greatest of Italian designers.
                    - She was neither a miser nor a spendthrift, but simply indifferent to money. In order to become the businesswoman she’d decided to be, she accepted without any apparent effort a radical transformation of her habits, of her wardrobe, of her style of life.]

            - Obituaries
            - obituaries often follow a template closely and exclude classic pre-sentation. Such obituaries are conventional descriptions of mainly surface information—date and place of birth, education, professional accomplishment, cause of death. in these routine perfor-mances, there is often no indication that the writer is responsible for selecting details or exercising independent judgment. There are, however, exceptions. Jeremy Pearce’s obituary for John L. Bull, one of the authors of The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Eastern Region, from which we quote in the first entry of the Museum, appeared in The New York Times for 15 August 2006. He includes the obligatory descriptive information but takes the classic stance in presenting what he has judged to be worth presenting. Here is how he ends the obituary:
            - Mr. Bull was often accompanied by his wife, an educator at the [American Museum of Natural History], on birding journeys. in 1989, the couple collaborated on a book, “Birds of North America: Western region: A Quick identification Guide for All Bird-Watchers.” remarking on the mourning doves that he spotted in central Park, Mr. Bull observed: “They are the most mo-
