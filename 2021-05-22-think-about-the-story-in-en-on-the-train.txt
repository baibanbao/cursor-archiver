Thinking about outline

The main character Hanjin

Her character must be developed in the second half of the story. Create a dynamic character instead of a stale one. 

She got married. 

She had a son whose name is Pan Huaibin.

Pan has an rebellious spirit. He is selfish. He just thinks about himself. When the family business is in danger, he doesn't care except his own well-being. Why he becomes so cold-hearted? Anyone can give a clue?

In a story, no one is absolutely good or bad. They need a good reason to do so.

When you concentrate the story, you will find the flaws. You have to make it right. Nothing can be corrected until you do so. 

> I am on a CRH train, I don't want any peeping Toms to find what I am writing. So I write it in En. That's not a complicated language, but advanced enough to keep most of the eyes over your shoulder.

Let's come back to our story.

Zhuo Tingting and Hanjin must have conflicts. They all have strong will power. They want to control the family, more specifically, Mr. Pan Jianlong. But they don't want to do it explicitly, they just do it unconsciously. It makes the story more complicated and darker, if one may say. So, don't underestimate your characters, they will take action by themselves.
