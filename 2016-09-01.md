- title: 'A new semster begins'
- --
- The first day of the new semster of the Kindergarten, I saw Jonas melted himself to the whole coholt of children at the safely-guarded gate. Now he is in the middle class instead of the jonior one. His mother and I worry a lot about him.
- Can he use chopsticks? Can he fall into sleep? Can he play harmously with other children?
- We don't know. But we are sure he will grow in the kindergarten. He has the power of growth which can enable him to deal with all the difficulties himself.
- This is a new day. So let's cherish it.
