还是乔治·奥威尔说得好：

> I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. But I could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article, if it were not also an aesthetic experience. 

我写作是因为有谎言要揭穿，有一些事实要引起人们的注意，我最初的动机是吸引大家来听。但我无论写书，还是写一篇杂志用的长文章的时候，都不能不追求美的体验。
