        - {{[[TODO]]}} 10:18 51 This was neat: I asked Code Interpreter: "Design a cool hard science fiction spaceship for me. work out details using code and math, of how it works." On the first try, got a neat lesson in ship design & physics

But I spotted a text (not math) error. Humans still needed, for now
这很棒：我问了代码解释器：“为我设计一艘酷炫的硬科幻飞船。使用代码和数学来详细解释它的工作原理。”第一次尝试，我得到了一堂关于飞船设计和物理学的精彩课程。

但我发现了一个（非数学）文本错误。目前仍需要人类。

Some are even calling it GPT4.5. I think they're right. Here are the best examples and resources I've found:" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanLands/status/1681257509296955397)
