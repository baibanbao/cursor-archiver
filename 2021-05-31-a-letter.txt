A Letter

Dear friends:

This is the last day of our 100 Days of Daily Writing Project. I have a few words to say.

You have been waiting for something for many years. But you were disappointed every time when you opened your door. It was the postman. It was the wind. It was nothing at all.

We are living in a changing era. Traditional values lose its favor; other values takes its position. Peace and simplicity is on the way out; sound and fury is on the way in. Many books has been written, few are worth of reading. In a time of entertainment, everything can be entertained.

As far as I perceive, You have never departed the time of innocence, the time of simplicities, when good is good, truth is truth, and most questions always have definite answers.

But now, everything is different.

That's why you were here. You just wanted to come up for air. Otherwise, you couldn't breathe freely.

Thank you for your coming. You contribution to this project shall be remembered. 

Writing is not always a happy memory. Sometimes it brings bitterness.

About four years ago, the Royal Shakespeare Company was going to recruit some Chinese translators to re-translate the works of Shakespeare. I submitted my translation, but the specialists in charge picked other translators.

I was crushed, but kept writing — and as you know, I now have two writing classes which attract more and more potential writers and playwrights. So persistence pays!

I have collected all the articles of this project and made it a zip file for your convenience. You can download it according to the instruction in the Wechat group.

Please read the README.txt carefully before you read or use any articles.

Guys, time to say goodbye. I wish you have an eventful journey in your odysseys of writing.

Wang Pei
