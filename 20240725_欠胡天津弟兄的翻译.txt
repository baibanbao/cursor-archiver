Let Kevin DeYoung Reintroduce You to the 10 Commandments

Over half of American children and young adults report wanting to become a social media influencer. As a society, we’ve succeeded in making a career out of “being famous for being famous,” a dream many consider to be vapid beyond belief and yet one others hope and strive for.

How on earth did we get here?

In Self-Made: Creating Our Identities from Da Vinci to the Kardashians, Tara Isabella Burton provides a compelling explanation. Her goal in Self-Made is to explain the influence and history of this contemporary impulse: “We not only can but should customize and curate every facet of our lives to reflect our inner truth” (2).

Self-Made

TARA ISABELLA BURTON

In a technologically-saturated era where nearly everything can be effortlessly and digitally reproduced, we’re all hungry to carve out our own unique personalities, our own bespoke personae, to stand out and be seen. As the forces of social media and capitalism collide, and individualism becomes more important than ever across a wide array of industries, “branding ourselves” or actively defining our selves for others has become the norm. Yet, this phenomenon is not new. In Self-Made, Tara Isabella Burton shows us how we arrived at this moment of fervent personal-branding.

PUBLICAFFAIRS. 288 PP.

Competing Stories of the West

Burton’s explanation of our cultural moment enters a crowded field; both popular and scholarly books are regularly appearing to tell us the Big Story of the West. These Big Stories can be understood as broad histories of ideas in Western culture—each in its own way trying to explain why we are the way we are—as opposed to class history books on a single topic like the American Civil War. Think of Andrew Wilson’s Remaking the World, Charles Taylor’s Sources of Self and A Secular Age, or Carl Trueman’s The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self.

These are Big Stories of the West, and they don’t all tell the same tale. Burton, a visiting fellow at George Mason University, is aware of this field. As she notes in her introduction, her book is in active conversation and at various levels of agreement with other works. Burton shows no fear as she jumps in. For example, she agrees with Taylor and says that “expressive individualism dominates how we think about ourselves in modern life” (5). Yet she has the confidence to reject his thesis that this shift is a move from a fundamentally religious worldview to a secular one.

Self-Made is, in part, a follow-up to Burton’s excellent book Strange Rites [read TGC’s review], which showed that Westerners are as fervently religious as ever. As a Christian, she’s alert to the religious and spiritual energy that illuminates every part of Western culture. By the time she makes sense of Kim Kardashian at the end of the book, it’s much easier to understand why Kardashian’s “famous for being famous” is a spiritual condition and not merely a vapid distraction from real life.

Balanced Approach

For those drawn to Big Stories of the West, Burton’s entry is a must-read because she intentionally seeks to fill in the gaps in the literature. Burton offers open-minded consideration of cultural trends without belittling. She seeks to understand before critiquing. It’s something any evangelical who wants to engage his neighbors should emulate.

Burton seeks to understand before critiquing. It’s something any evangelical who wants to engage his neighbors should emulate.

Burton’s engagement doesn’t keep her from expressing her evaluation that “our history of self-creation is not an inspiring tale of unremitting progress” (8). And yet she immediately adds, “I do not think it is a tragic narrative about cultural decline and the dangers of modernity, such as we have seen in the accounts of recent cultural critics from Philip Rieff to Carl Trueman” (8).

Her history travels through the Big Story via a series of little stories. Each chapter features at least one exemplar of the ideas of self-expression and self-creation as those ideas developed and deepened in the modern period.

While no history can be fully expressed by individuals, Burton’s lively storytelling and choice of exemplars keep the book engaging as she traces multiple threads in her cultural analysis.

Dangers on All Sides

Most crucially, Self-Made demonstrates that the popular bogeymen of both the left and the right deserve equal attention. They feed each other.

Some social critics want to isolate how destructive expressive individualism is, especially in its sexual manifestations. Others want to isolate the evils of racism, sexism, and classism. Burton agrees that both are problematic and uses a wide-angle lens to examine together the many varieties of evil at play. She points out their similarities and the damage they do to individuals and society.

For example, Burton argues that, ironically, the supposed equity of expressive individualism creates a new caste system. If you feed this philosophy to a society, declaring you have a moral duty to become a true and authentic self, you cannot help but create an underclass out of the humans who couldn’t or didn’t achieve this self and thus are despised.

Ironically, the supposed equity of expressive individualism creates a new caste system.

This shows up in the horrific sexual vision of Marquis de Sade, who saw other humans as objects to be used and discarded. It appears in the vision of the Western distinction between Europeans and “savages.” It’s revealed in the degradation of women. And it bubbles up in the disdain for normal people who, as a class, “began to be described in two distinct ways: as a single, shapeless mass and as mere inanimate machines” (117). Individualist self-creation became the pattern for authentic personhood.

To varying degrees, we’ve witnessed some of these attitudes within orthodox, evangelical circles. Burton’s treatment of the problem with our self-expressive culture is important for evangelical Christians to read because it demonstrates that, tragically but truly, there isn’t an us versus them but an all of us, caught up a tide.

Diagnosis Without Prescription

“Who am I, really?” When Western society tries to answer this question, Burton reports, the answer is whoever I want to be (235). She chastises this Western understanding of “self-expression [as] not just a moral requirement but a teleological one” for three main reasons (233).

First, as discussed above, expressive individualism has created two classes within society based on success at self-expression. Second, it’s impossible to be truly independent. Even our desires, now deemed the most authentic parts of our beings, are often significantly shaped by others (234–35). Third, the Western story obscures how social we are as a species; we truly need each other.

Burton masterfully exposes the cracks in the system, but she doesn’t fill them. Though she’s a professing Christian with a background in theology, she fails to provide a prescription for what ails us. Seeing both the promise and the perils of self, she shrugs and basically says, “We’re only human.”

Her three complaints only have their true solutions in the gospel: the good news of a God who insists all are created in his image. These solutions arise from the truth that his Word is more freeing than our deceitful hearts. And, ultimately, we’re made not only for each other but for God as the Father of this human family.

Self-Made is an important and urgent though incomplete tale. Burton writes that we’re “caught between facticity and freedom, trying imperfectly to work out how to relate ourselves to both” (236). It’s this condition of modernity that, rightly illuminated, could lead us straight to the gospel, because we already ache for it.

Think of Andrew Wilson’s Remaking the World, Charles Taylor’s Sources of Self and A Secular Age, or Carl Trueman’s The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self.

西方的竞争性故事

伯顿对我们文化时刻的解释进入了一个拥挤的领域；流行和学术书籍都定期出现，告诉我们西方的大故事。这些大故事可以理解为西方文化中关于思想的广泛历史——每一种以其方式试图解释我们为什么是现在这个样子——与聚焦单一主题如美国内战的传统历史书籍相对。想想安德鲁·威尔逊的《重塑世界》，查尔斯·泰勒的《自我之源与世俗时代》，或者卡尔·特鲁曼的《现代自我的崛起与胜利》。

These are Big Stories of the West, and they don’t all tell the same tale. Burton, a visiting fellow at George Mason University, is aware of this field. As she notes in her introduction, her book is in active conversation and at various levels of agreement with other works. Burton shows no fear as she jumps in. For example, she agrees with Taylor and says that “expressive individualism dominates how we think about ourselves in modern life” (5). Yet she has the confidence to reject his thesis that this shift is a move from a fundamentally religious worldview to a secular one.

这些是西方的大故事，并不是所有故事都讲述同样的情节。作为乔治梅森大学的访问学者，伯顿对这个领域很了解。正如她在引言中所述，她的书与其他作品进行了积极的对话，并在不同程度上达成了共识。伯顿在参与中毫无畏惧。例如，她同意泰勒的观点，认为“表现性个体主义主宰了我们在现代生活中对自我思考的方式”（5）。然而，她有信心拒绝他的论点，即这种转变是从一个基本的宗教世界观向一个世俗世界观的转移。

Self-Made is, in part, a follow-up to Burton’s excellent book Strange Rites [read TGC’s review], which showed that Westerners are as fervently religious as ever. As a Christian, she’s alert to the religious and spiritual energy that illuminates every part of Western culture. By the time she makes sense of Kim Kardashian at the end of the book, it’s much easier to understand why Kardashian’s “famous for being famous” is a spiritual condition and not merely a vapid distraction from real life.

《自我打造》部分是对伯顿精彩的书《奇异仪式》[阅读TGC的评论]的后续，该书显示了西方人仍然如此热衷宗教。作为一名基督徒，她对照亮西方文化每一个部分的宗教和精神能量保持警觉。到了书的最后她理解金·卡戴珊的时候，就更容易理解卡戴珊“因著名而著名”的原因是一种精神状态，而不仅仅是现实生活中的空洞干扰。

平衡的方法

对于那些被西方的大故事吸引的人来说，伯顿的作品是必读之物，因为她有意识地试图填补文学中的空白。伯顿以开放的心态考虑文化趋势，而不是轻视它们。她在批评之前寻求理解。这是任何希望与邻居交流的福音派应该效仿的。

伯顿的参与并没有阻止她表达她的评价，“我们自我创造的历史并不是一个不间断进步的鼓舞人心的故事”(8)。然而，她立即补充道，“我不认为这是一个关于文化衰退和现代性危险的悲惨叙事，正如我们在最近从菲利普·里夫到卡尔·特鲁曼的文化批评家们的描述中所看到的”(8)。

虽然没有哪个历史可以被个人完全表达，但伯顿生动的叙事和选择的典型使得这本书在她进行文化分析时跟踪多个线索，保持了引人入胜。

四面楚歌的危险

最关键的是，《自我打造》表明，左右两派的流行妖魔都值得同等关注。它们相互滋养。

Some social critics want to isolate how destructive expressive individualism is, especially in its sexual manifestations. Others want to isolate the evils of racism, sexism, and classism. Burton agrees that both are problematic and uses a wide-angle lens to examine together the many varieties of evil at play. She points out their similarities and the damage they do to individuals and society.

一些社会评论家想要孤立表现出来的破坏性个人主义，特别是其在性方面的表现。其他人则想要孤立种族主义、性别歧视和阶级歧视的罪恶。伯顿认同这两者都有问题，并使用广角镜头一起审视在游戏中的多种邪恶。她指出了它们的相似之处以及它们对个人和社会造成的损害。

For example, Burton argues that, ironically, the supposed equity of expressive individualism creates a new caste system. If you feed this philosophy to a society, declaring you have a moral duty to become a true and authentic self, you cannot help but create an underclass out of the humans who couldn’t or didn’t achieve this self and thus are despised.

例如，伯顿讽刺地指出，表现性个体主义所谓的公平实际上创造了一个新的种姓制度。如果你将这种哲学灌输给一个社会，宣称你有道德责任成为一个真实和真正的自我，你不可避免地会从那些未能或没有实现这一自我的人中创造出一个下层阶级，因此被鄙视。

这在马尔基斯·德·萨德的恐怖性愿景中表现出来，他将其他人视为可以使用和抛弃的对象。这在西方区分欧洲人和“野蛮人”的视角中出现。这在对女性的贬低中显现出来。并且在对普通人的蔑视中涌现出来，作为一个阶级，“开始以两种截然不同的方式被描述：作为一个单一的、无形的群体和作为单纯的无生命机器”（117）。个体主义自我创造成为真实人格的模式。

To varying degrees, we’ve witnessed some of these attitudes within orthodox, evangelical circles. Burton’s treatment of the problem with our self-expressive culture is important for evangelical Christians to read because it demonstrates that, tragically but truly, there isn’t an us versus them but an all of us, caught up in a tide.

在不同程度上，我们在正统的福音派圈子中也见证了一些这样的态度。伯顿对我们自我表达文化的问题处理对福音派基督徒来说是重要的阅读，因为它表明，悲剧性地但确实地，这不是我们对他们的对抗，而是我们所有人都被卷入了这一潮流中。

Diagnosis Without Prescription

“Who am I, really?” When Western society tries to answer this question, Burton reports, the answer is whoever I want to be (235). She chastises this Western understanding of “self-expression [as] not just a moral requirement but a teleological one” for three main reasons (233).

没有处方的诊断

“我究竟是谁？”当西方社会试图回答这个问题时，伯顿报告说，答案是我想成为的任何人（235）。她因三个主要原因（233）指责这种西方对“自我表达不仅是道德要求，而且是目的论要求”的理解。

First, as discussed above, expressive individualism has created two classes within society based on success at self-expression. Second, it’s impossible to be truly independent. Even our desires, now deemed the most authentic parts of our beings, are often significantly shaped by others (234–35). Third, the Western story obscures how social we are as a species; we truly need each other.

首先，如上所述，表现性个体主义在社会中基于自我表达的成功创造了两个阶级。其次，真正的独立是不可能的。即使是我们的欲望，现在被认为是我们存在最真实的部分，往往也受到他人的显著影响（234-35）。第三，西方的叙事模糊了我们作为一个物种的社会性；我们真正需要彼此。

Burton masterfully exposes the cracks in the system, but she doesn’t fill them. Though she’s a professing Christian with a background in theology, she fails to provide a prescription for what ails us. Seeing both the promise and the perils of self, she shrugs and basically says, “We’re only human.”

伯顿巧妙地揭示了系统中的裂痕，但她没有填补它们。尽管她是一位自称的基督徒，拥有神学背景，但她未能提供治愈我们病痛的处方。看到自我的承诺和危险，她耸了耸肩，基本上说：“我们只是人类。”

Her three complaints only have their true solutions in the gospel: the good news of a God who insists all are created in his image. These solutions arise from the truth that his Word is more freeing than our deceitful hearts. And, ultimately, we’re made not only for each other but for God as the Father of this human family.

她的三个抱怨只有在福音中找到真正的解决办法：一位坚持所有人都按照他的形象创造的上帝的好消息。这些解决方案源于他的话比我们欺骗性的心更能释放人的真理。最终，我们不仅是为彼此而存在，也是为了上帝，作为这个人类大家庭的父亲。

Self-Made is an important and urgent though incomplete tale. Burton writes that we’re “caught between facticity and freedom, trying imperfectly to work out how to relate ourselves to both” (236). It’s this condition of modernity that, rightly illuminated, could lead us straight to the gospel, because we already ache for it.

《自我打造》是一个重要且紧迫但不完整的故事。伯顿写道，我们“被困在事实性和自由之间，试图不完美地解决如何将自己与两者联系起来”（236）。这是现代性的状况，如果得到正确的阐明，可以直接引导我们走向福音，因为我们已经为此感到痛苦。
