ChatGPT编辑作文，转化为分镜头脚本。 用Midjourney根据分镜脚本作图。用Leiapix让画面有一些动感。剪映专业版中输入文本全自动断句，剪辑，配音，配乐。然后我用ai作的视频替换掉剪映专业版中的视频素材，稍作些微调。最后在剪映里加上片头片尾

作文原文：

这一天，森林里刮起了台风。台风连续刮了三天。

小动物们全躲了起来。连小黄鹂都藏到山洞里避难。往哪里走都看不见动物们的踪影。

突然，台风停下了。小黄鹂蹦蹦跳跳地飞了出来。可是刚飞出来它就惊呆了！因为它看见树都倒了，有好多树被连根拔起。

“哎呀！”小黄鹂大叫到，“这是怎么回事呀？没地方做窝啦！”

于是它跟小动物们开了一个会。小动物们决定再种一些树。

于是它们采集了很多树种子，然后开始种树。

小黄鹂种得很努力。它左边撒撒种子，右边撒撒种子。

小动物们努力地干活，因为它们知道马上会有新的森林长出来。

————CHATGPT编辑的（我只把“众动物”改为了“动物们”，“深知”改为了“深信”，让语句显得更简单。“齐心协力”一行里出现了两次，我删掉了一次。）：

这天，森林里刮起了狂风暴雨，台风肆虐了整整三昼夜。

小动物们纷纷躲避不见，就连小黄鹂也紧闭翅膀躲进山洞，寻求庇护。风暴过后，四野间再无它们的身影。

终于，台风息了。小黄鹂欢快地飞出洞口，却被眼前的景象惊呆了！众树倾覆凋零，连同根顷刻被拔起，一片狼藉。

“天哪！”小黄鹂惊叫道，“这是怎么回事？我的家……我的窝哪儿去了？”

于是，它与动物们商议着，决定重建森林。

动物们采集了满满一篮篮树种，齐心协力开始播种。

小黄鹂卖力地撒播，左一点儿，右一点儿，从容不迫。

动物们尽心尽力，深信新的森林即将蓬勃生长。
