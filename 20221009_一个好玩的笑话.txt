Reminds me of Y2K. Back at New year's in 1999, we were celebrating with our neighbor who was a scientist at ESA (European Space Agency, he worked on the James Webb Space Telescope even back then and wrote several articles about it, really smart guy).

Midnight nears and we start counting down. 3.. 2.. 1.. poof power is suddenly gone and our neighbor yells "Those idiots! It actually happened?! How could this happen?!"

Then we can hear my mom laughing in the background, she had snuck off and flipped the main circuit breaker for the house. Absolutely best practical joke she, or anyone, has ever made that I've experienced.

We still laugh about this 2 decades later.
