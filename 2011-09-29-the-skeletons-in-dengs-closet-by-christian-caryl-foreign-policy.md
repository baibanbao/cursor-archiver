- [The Skeletons in Deng's Closet - By Christian Caryl | Foreign Policy](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/09/13/the_skeletons_in_dengs_closet?page=full)
- My favorite quote comes from Deng's youngest son: "My father thinks Gorbachev is an idiot."
- Oddly enough, whenever Vogel brings up the subject, it's the party that gets to decide what constitutes Chinese values. The critics somehow never do.
- He tells us that some of the critical texts put up to public view on Beijing's Democracy Wall, the place where a remarkable spirit of pluralism was allowed to flourish for a few months starting in late 1978, "were posted by other young people who were inspired by their newfound freedom but, having lived in a closed society, lacked the experience and wisdom to inform or temper their judgments." People's Daily couldn't have put it better.
