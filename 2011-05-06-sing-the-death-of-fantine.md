- 今天是老婆的生日，我们一起录制了音乐剧《悲惨世界》中芳汀和冉阿让的一段唱：Come to me.
- 芳汀贫病交加，在弥留之际，仿佛看到了女儿珂塞特，她把女儿托付给冉阿让。
- 由于老婆微感风寒，没有唱出在女王剧院演出时的水平。

- 歌词：
- Fantine 
- Cosette, it's turned so cold 
- Cosette, it's past your bedtime 
- You've played the day away 
- And soon it will be night. 
- Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading 
- Don't you see the evening star appearing? 
- Come to me, and rest against my shoulder 
- How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder. 
- Hurry near, another day is dying 
- Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying? 
- There's a darkness which comes without a warning 
- But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning. 
- [Valjean enters.] 
- Valjean 
- Oh, Fantine, our time is running out 
- But Fantine, I swear this on my life 
- Fantine 
- Look, M'sieur, where all the children play 
- Valjean 
- Be at peace, be at peace evermore. 
- Fantine 
- My Cosette... 
- Valjean 
- Shall live in my protection 
- Fantine 
- Take her now 
- Valjean 
- Your child will want for nothing 
- Fantine 
- Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven. 
- Valjean 
- And none will ever harm Cosette 
- As long as I am living. 
- Fantine 
- Take my hand, 
- The night grows ever colder. 
- Valjean 
- Then I will keep you warm. 
- Fantine 
- Take my child, I give her to your keeping. 
- Valjean 
- Take shelter from the storm 
- Fantine 
- For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping 
- And tell Cosette I love her 
- And I'll see her when I wake...
