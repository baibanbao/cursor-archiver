    - SHOW DON’T TELL ALERT - Pixar shows the entire life of Carl and Ellie in the opening 10 minutes of the movie with nary a word of dialogue.  Study this sequence religiously to see how good writers substitute images and actions for words.

    - What would the Coens do? - If you have a scene or section of your script that feels boring, I’m going to give you a great tip.  Ask yourself, “What would the Coens do?”  The Coens rarely make an obvious choice.

    - When you bombard your character from all sides, you create LOTS OF DRAMA. And when you have lots of drama, scenes write themselves. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ADZRJ7Y&location=1973))
    - The easiest way to make a scene interesting is to have two people want different things out of the scene. ([Location 1976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ADZRJ7Y&location=1976))
