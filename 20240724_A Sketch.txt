A Sketch

In a party center, I met a man, a middle-aged man, who wears a white shirt, blue pants, and leather shoes. He looks very contented with his appearance, and rightly so—that's the uniform of the core party. I know he's just a small figure, even a useless one, in this system. These centers are just places filled with fools, useless fools. But he doesn't care. He thinks he's important. His step, his arrogance—they all tell the same story. I saw the irony as I walked behind him. He's a person, maybe in his forties, who's just found a nice job for life, and he's very admired by many people. Let's be real. In this system, a lot of people don't even have salaries. They're busy with life and worrying about tomorrow and this guy. His wife has nothing to worry about. They worry about his promotion, his connections, or even his wife's death. They might even worry about her daughter. They must have something to arouse their passion, something that will excite them in their sexual lives. I don't know. He might have other interests, like golf or badminton. I don't know. There are many possibilities. What I do know is that he works at this center and he's eager to share his identity and job responsibilities. He's content with his role and status. It's clear that he's at the top of his game. I'm not sure if this is true, but I'd say it's 80% accurate.
