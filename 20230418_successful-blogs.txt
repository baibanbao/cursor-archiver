Set up a website analytics tool like Google Analytics to track your blog's performance metrics. This will help you to understand how many visitors are coming to your blog, how long they are staying, and what actions they are taking on your site.

Use social media analytics tools like Hootsuite or Sprout Social to track engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments on your social media posts. This will help you to understand how your audience is interacting with your content on social media.

Use conversion tracking tools like Google Ads or Facebook Ads to track the number of leads or sales generated from your blog. This will help you to understand how your blog is contributing to your overall business goals.
