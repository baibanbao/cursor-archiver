Dear OpenAI employees:

Today I received an email from OpenAI to notice me that one of my payment method is judged as invalid.

Hi haozhongwen,

We were unable to process your last payment for $5.51 using your visa ending in 3921. Your card was declined.

Please review your payment method, and update it if necessary to continue using the API uninterrupted.

Review Payment Method

We'll try to process your payment again in a few days. If we aren't able to complete your payment by Jul 2, 2023 12:00 AM UTC, your organization's API access will be suspended.

If you have any questions, please contact us through our help center, and we'll be happy to assist.

It's a great irony that the account associated with haozhongwen (and email redredpei@gmail.com) has been deleted or disactivated by you.

How could I change or complete the payment without my account existing. What's this? Catch-22?

I am a loyal user of OpenAI and willing to pay high price to use ChatGPT, but am I treated as an customer? I don't think so.

The payment failure problem is not my intention nor expectation. I have to pay you with flexible methods which may conflict with your policy. I admit it. But please give me the chance to try again. I paid the same honest money to you via some institutions. Just please give me some understanding and tolerance.

Please notice that I can't complete the payment without my account restored, which seems impossible right now.

I just want you know that what a common user feels. Nothing more, nothing less.

Best wishes for a giant like OpenAI.

Wish you prosper and treat your users kindly someday.
