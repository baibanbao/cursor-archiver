- ### Highlights first synced by #Readwise [[July 10th, 2022]]
    - Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=239))
    - Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn’t possess, acts but doesn’t expect. When her work is done, she forgets it. That is why it lasts forever. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=250))
    - Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=267))
    - The Tao is like a well: used but never used up. It is like the eternal void: filled with infinite possibilities. It is hidden but always present. I don’t know who gave birth to it. It is older than God. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=270))
    - The Tao doesn’t take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil. The Master doesn’t take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=277))
    - Hold on to the center. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=284))
    - It is always present within you. You can use it any way you want. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=289))
    - The Tao is infinite, eternal. Why is it eternal? It was never born; thus it can never die. Why is it infinite? It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings. The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead. She is detached from all things; that is why she is one with them. Because she has let go of herself, she is perfectly fulfilled. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=292))
    - In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don’t try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=307))
    - When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete, everybody will respect you. ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=311))
    - Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench. Care about people’s approval and you will be their prisoner. Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=316))
    - Can you love people and lead them without imposing your will? Can you deal with the most vital matters by letting events take their course? Can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things? ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=330))
    - We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=340))
    - Colors blind the eye. Sounds deafen the ear. Flavors numb the taste. Thoughts weaken the mind. Desires wither the heart. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=351))
    - Success is as dangerous as failure. Hope is as hollow as fear. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=359))
    - Look, and it can’t be seen. Listen, and it can’t be heard. Reach, and it can’t be grasped. Above, it isn’t bright. Below, it isn’t dark. Seamless, unnamable, it returns to the realm of nothing. Form that includes all forms, image without an image, subtle, beyond all conception. Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end. You can’t know it, but you can be it, at ease in your own life. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=374))
    - Just realize where you come from: this is the essence of wisdom. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=385))
    - They were careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream. Alert as a warrior in enemy territory. Courteous as a guest. Fluid as melting ice. Shapable as a block of wood. Receptive as a valley. Clear as a glass of water. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=392))
    - Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear? ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=398))
    - Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself? The Master doesn’t seek fulfillment. Not seeking, not expecting, she is present, and can welcome all things. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=400))
    - If you don’t realize the source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow. When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=411))
    - Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=417))
    - When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. Next best is a leader who is loved. Next, one who is feared. The worst is one who is despised. If you don’t trust the people, you make them untrustworthy. The Master doesn’t talk, he acts. When his work is done, the people say, “Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves! ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=421))
    - When the country falls into chaos, patriotism is born. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=436))
    - Throw away holiness and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times happier. Throw away morality and justice, and people will do the right thing. Throw away industry and profit, and there won’t be any thieves. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=440))
    - like an infant before it can smile. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=456))
    - Other people are bright; I alone am dark. Other people are sharp; I alone am dull. Other people have a purpose; I alone don’t know. I drift like a wave on the ocean, I blow as aimless as the wind. ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=461))
    - Other people are bright; I alone am dark. Other people are sharp; I alone am dull. Other people have a purpose; I alone don’t know. I drift like a wave on the ocean, ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=461))
    - I am different from ordinary people. I drink from the Great Mother’s breasts. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=467))
    - I am different from ordinary people. I drink from the Great Mother’s breasts. ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=467))
    - Since before time and space were, the Tao is. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=478))
    - If you want to be reborn, let yourself die. If you want to be given everything, give everything up. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=488))
        - **Note**: Nonesense translation. 

少 则 得 ， 多 则 惑 。
    - Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao. The Tao follows only itself. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=545))
    - If you let yourself be blown to and fro, you lose touch with your root. If you let restlessness move you, you lose touch with who you are. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=556))
    - A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants. A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=561))
    - Know the male, yet keep to the female: receive the world in your arms. If you receive the world, the Tao will never leave you and you will be like a little child. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=576))
    - Do you want to improve the world? I don’t think it can be done. The world is sacred. It can’t be improved. If you tamper with it, you’ll ruin it. If you treat it like an object, you’ll lose it. ([Location 596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=596))
    - There is a time for being ahead, a time for being behind; a time for being in motion, a time for being at rest; a time for being vigorous, a time for being exhausted; a time for being safe, a time for being in danger. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=601))
    - For every force there is a counterforce. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=614))
    - Weapons are the tools of violence; all decent men detest them. Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them except in the direst necessity and, if compelled, will use them only with the utmost restraint. Peace is his highest value. If the peace has been shattered, how can he be content? His enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself. He doesn’t wish them personal harm. Nor does he rejoice in victory. How could he rejoice in victory and delight in the slaughter of men? ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=627))
    - He enters a battle gravely, with sorrow and with great compassion, as if he were attending a funeral. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=640))
    - The Tao can’t be perceived, Smaller than an electron, it contains uncountable galaxies. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=644))
        - **Note**: Great translation
    - All things end in the Tao as rivers flow into the sea. ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=656))
    - Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=659))
    - Music or the smell of good cooking may make people stop and enjoy. But words that point to the Tao seem monotonous and without flavor. When you look for it, there is nothing to see. When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear. When you use it, it is inexhaustible. ([Location 685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=685))
    - If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given. ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=694))
    - The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast. Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results. ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=699))
    - The Master does nothing, yet he leaves nothing undone. The ordinary man is always doing things, yet many more are left to be done. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=718))
    - When the Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is morality. When morality is lost, there is ritual. Ritual is the husk of true faith, the beginning of chaos. ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=726))
    - Therefore the Master concerns himself with the depths and not the surface, with the fruit and not the flower. He has no will of his own. He dwells in reality, and lets all illusions go. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=730))
    - All things are born of being. Being is born of non-being. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=754))
    - When a superior man hears of the Tao, he immediately begins to embody it. When an average man hears of the Tao, he half believes it, half doubts it. When a foolish man hears of the Tao, he laughs out loud. If he didn’t laugh, it wouldn’t be the Tao. ([Location 758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=758))
    - Thus it is said: The path into the light seems dark, the path forward seems to go back, the direct path seems long, true power seems weak, true purity seems tarnished, true steadfastness seems changeable, true clarity seems obscure, ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=764))
    - the greatest art seems unsophisticated, the greatest love seems indifferent, the greatest wisdom seems childish. ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=770))
    - The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things. ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=776))
    - All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male. When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=779))
    - The gentlest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world. That which has no substance enters where there is no space. This shows the value of non-action. Teaching without words, performing without actions: that is the Master’s way. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=787))
    - Fame or integrity: which is more important? Money or happiness: which is more valuable? Success or failure: which is more destructive? ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=795))
    - If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=798))
    - When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors. When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=817))
        - **Note**: 天 下 有 道 ， 却 走 马 以 粪 。
天 下 无 道 ， 戎 马 生 于 郊 。
GREAT TRANSLATION.
    - Without opening your door, you can open your heart to the world. Without looking out your window, you can see the essence of the Tao. The more you know, the less you understand. The Master arrives without leaving, sees the light without looking, achieves without doing a thing. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=827))
    - When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. ([Location 840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=840))
        - **Note**: 无 为 而 无 不 为 。
    - The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and he has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body. He doesn’t think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being. He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day’s work. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=858))
        - **Note**: Every sentence is wrong!
    - Seeing into darkness is clarity. Knowing how to yield is strength. Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=895))
    - Whoever is planted in the Tao will not be rooted up. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=912))
    - Let the Tao be present in your life and you will become genuine. Let it be present in your family and your family will flourish. Let it be present in your country and your country will be an example to all countries in the world. Let it be present in the universe and the universe will sing. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=916))
    - It doesn’t know about the union of male and female, yet its penis can stand erect, so intense is its vital power. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=929))
        - **Note**: 未 知 牝 牡 之 合 而 峻 作 ， 精 之 至 也 。
    - The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be. The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be. The more subsidies you have, the less self-reliant people will be. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=959))
    - Therefore the Master says: I let go of the law, and people become honest. ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=964))
    - I let go of economics, and people become prosperous. I let go of religion, and people become serene. I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes common as grass. ([Location 966](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=966))
    - Nothing is impossible for him. Because he has let go, ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=995))
    - Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1000))
    - Prevent trouble before it arises. Put things in order before they exist. The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout. The journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath your feet. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1057))
        - **Note**: 为 之 于 未 有 ， 治 之 于 未 乱 。
　 　合 抱 之 木 ， 生 于 毫 末 ﹔
九 层 之 台 ， 起 于 累 土 ﹔
千 里 之 行 ， 始 于 足 下。
    - Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1098))
    - I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and in thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1106))
        - **Note**: You can call it anything but Tao De Ching!
    - When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield. ([Location 1138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1138))
        - **Note**: Nonsense translation.
    - Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick; then you can move toward health. ([Location 1151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1151))
    - If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you aren’t afraid of dying, there is nothing you can’t achieve. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1175))
    - When taxes are too high, people go hungry. When the government is too intrusive, people lose their spirit. Act for the people’s benefit. Trust them; leave them alone. ([Location 1184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1184))
    - They take from those who don’t have enough and give to those who have far too much. ([Location 1209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1209))
    - People enjoy their food, take pleasure in being with their families, spend weekends working in their gardens, delight in the doings of the neighborhood. And even though the next country is so close that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking, they are content to die of old age without ever having gone to see it. ([Location 1246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003SHDM8O&location=1246))
