shortly after she gave birth to a stillborn child. This event was a great shock
to Luther and his friends; see also WA, Br 4, 276 (dated November 4). Ap-
parently there would have been a slight possibility of saving the child's life by
a caesarian; WA, Br 4, 275, 276. According to WA, Br 4, 275, n. 13, it was
a custom to perform a caesarian on a dead woman; caesarian operations on a
living woman, however, were not performed prior to the sixteenth century.

suffering from the plague or was teething; see WA, Br 4, 275, 276. In view of
the length of the boy's illness the former seems to be more probable; at least

Luthers Briefe, Sendschreiben und Bedenken [Berlin, 18271 3, 220) suggests
that the letter which Luther says he sent "yesterday" might be the one of

Luther could very well have written to Jonas on November 4, but-in view of
the plague situation-could not send off the letter until "yesterday," i.e., ca.
November 9. Another possibility would be to assume that Luther's memory
tricked him-a good possibility--and that "yesterday" is not to be taken literally.
In the opinion of this editor, the letter to Jonas mentioned by Luther at the
beginning of this letter of ca. November 10 is the one of November 4 (WA.
Br 4. No. 1165). A comparison of the content of the letters of November 4
and that of ca. November 10 could substantiate this assumption in more detail

married to Augustine Schurf in approximately 1522. Augustine Schurf (the
brother of Jerome Schurf; see LW 48, 219, n. 2) had been teaching medicine
in Wittenberg since 1521, and performed the first dissection of a human head
at Wittenberg University. On Augustine Schurf, see ARG 7 (1909/10), 360 f.

the Luthers took in people during this plague epidemic, even if they were
sick, so that Luther said his home was beginning to be a hospital; WA, Br 4,

in after November 2, having been greatly shocked by the dramatic passing of
George Rörer's wife, who had died in the Bugenhagen home; WA, Br 4, 276.

lectured (see p. 181) to a small group of students who for unknown reasons
had not left town; and he wrote his beautiful long pastoral letter addressed to
John Hess in Breslau (see LW 48, 143, n. 5), which is entitled: Whether One
May Flee From a Deadly Plague; WA 23, 338 ff.; LW 43, 113 f. Luther's
actions during these months of danger and distress, together with this treatise,
give some of the strongest testimony of Luther's understanding of the respon-
sibilities a pastor has toward his flock, and a Christian toward his brother.

closer examination of both letters could substantiate the argument that in the

report on those events which he had mentioned for the first time on No-

MARTIN LUTHER, dirt for Christ's sake10
177
To John Brenz
Torgau,' November 28, 1527
With this letter Luther begins his correspondence with John Brenz.
He extends greetings and expresses his pleasure that Brenz is walk-
ing so steadfastly in the way of truth and maintaining the true
teaching concerning the Lord's Supper.
John Brenz (1499-1570) met Luther for the first time at the
Heidelberg Disputation in 1518,3 and saw him again at the Mar-
burg Colloquy in 1529,3 In 1522 Brenz gradually introduced the
Reformation in Schwäbisch Hall, where on Christmas Day, 1525,
the first evangelical Lord's Supper was celebrated, and where Brenz
organized the Reformation by creating an evangelical church ordi-
nance in 1526.4 From 1534 Brenz was responsible for guiding the
development of the Reformation in the Duchy of Württemberg.
After the Smalcaldic War, Brenz had to flee from Schwäbisch Hall
in 1548 in order to avoid imprisonment. Christopher, the duke of
Württemberg, called Brenz back and appointed him to the position
Dürings. Luther interpreted this as an act of hostility toward his city of
Wittenberg.

"Christ's mud." For
"dirt" Luther wrote lutum, and this was
obviously a pun on his name.
