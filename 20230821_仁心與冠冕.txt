From among a crowd of adoring women, a plucky suffragette in a hot-air
balloon sails away into the skies of London. Looking slightly queasy, she
flings handfuls of leaflets over the West End. Suddenly we see a neat
young man at an open window, incongruously clutching a bow and
arrow. Kneeling, cupid-like, he takes aim and lets fly. A voice, the young
man’s, tells us what happens next: ‘I shot an arrow in the air; She fell to
earth in Berkeley Square.’ It is a great moment of British film comedy,
because, of course, nothing here is as it seems: a man in drag plays the
suffragette; the archer’s wit is murderous.


What were the possibilities which thus presented themselves? Firstly,

that of making a film not noticeably similar to any previously made in

the English language. Secondly, that of using this English language,

which I love, in a more varied and, to me, more interesting way than I

hadpreviouslyhadthechanceof doinginafilm.Thirdly, thatof making

a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not

practised, moral convention. This last was not from any desire to shock,

but from an impulse to escape the somewhat inflexible and unshaded

characterization which convention tends to enforce in scripts.

Hamer makes the film do these things, subtly drawing us into a world of duplications, echoes and resemblances.
