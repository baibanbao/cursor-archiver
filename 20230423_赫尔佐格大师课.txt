I read and read and read and I get into this fury of language, and it’s ...the highest caliber of language. And I know when I start to write, I’m not gonna step down below this. —Werner Herzog

Herzog challenges the traditional three-act structure taught
in film schools and says it leads to mediocre and predictable films. Herzog emphasizes writing with a sense of urgency. Not necessarily at great speed or with time constraints, but with a focus on dedicating time to recording the thoughts and pictures as they arrive in your mind. Don't dwell. Write!
Werner's writing is very disciplined, to the point where he tries to never erase a single word once he writes it down. Use this type of urgency and precision to increase the quality of your own writing.

Herzog talks about “psyching” himself up with poetry and music before he writes. He cites the works of Virgil, a Roman poet, as an example that leads to his highest caliber of writing. You can read a translation of one of Virgil's pieces, The Georgics
