- What I Will And Will Not Miss About China
- 10:19am Wednesday, Jun 13
- A note thus titled by my Australian friend Loz who also teaches in Nanjing has prompted me to write one of my own, as a fitting "goodbye for now, see you soon" tribute to my second home, China. (It should be clear which ones I will miss and which I will not. I will clarify as necessary.)
- People thinking white skin is beautiful. God, I love that.
- Wondering if this is your last day on earth every time you enter a taxi. Or cross the street.
- The hocking of loogies, everywhere. You all have no idea. (Okay, well some of you do.)
- Children peeing and pooing right on the street.
- The stares.
- Having to explain that even "一点点" (a little bit) of meat makes a dish no longer vegetarian. Also having to tell them that 火腿肠 (hotdog meat) is indeed meat and no, yes I'm sure, it is not a vegetable.
- Buying Starbucks on a Chinese salary. Ouch.
- How super helpful Chinese people can become when they see you're foreign.
- How they become even nicer when you speak Chinese.
- How disappointed they become when they see you know how to bargain.
- Buddhist vegetarian restaurants.
- Chinese gaudy decorations and the insane amounts of fluorescent lights they have on at night. (Yes, I will miss this.)
- Children saying "hello!" to me as I walk down the street. (Will miss.)
- Guys saying "hello!" to me and laughing with their friends at their bravado as I walk down the street. (Not miss.)
- How washing dishes often consists in rinsing them with cold water.
- My good students.
- My bad students. (Although to be perfectly honest, some of them were funny in their own way too... Most of them I will not miss.)
- Students cheating on quizzes and thinking it's normal or even funny.
- 白酒 Baijiu, a kind of Chinese alcohol. I will very much miss.
- Eating meals with a large group of Chinese friends or my Chinese family.
- Cab drivers asking me how much money I earn. Cab drivers telling me (not asking me) things about America and how rich we all are. As a matter of fact, I'm going to miss everything about Chinese cab drivers except their driving.
- People very flatteringly (if completely inaccurately) comparing me to 大山 (a Canadian in China extremely famous for speaking perfect Chinese).
- Chinese children. The most adorable children in the world.
- Really fat Chinese men pulling their shirts halfway up in hot weather.
- Riding with 70 other people on a bus meant for 30 on a really hot day. (Did I mention most Chinese people do not wear deodorant?)
- Chinese people talking about me thinking I don't understand.
- Knowing how to write characters that Chinese people forget, and writing it for them. (Granted, this has only happened once, but it was a great feeling.)
- How direct Chinese people are. ("You know him, the really fat one." "Excuse me?!")
- Nanjing dialect. (啊是啊?)
- Suzhou dialect. (啊是个啊?)
- The Chinglish signs. ("Civilized behavior of tourists is another bright scenery." "Mouse salad." "For defecate, go to F2." And, compliments of Loz, "Cunt examination room." I kid you not.)
- Having to boil water before you can drink it.
- Garbages often consisting in piles on the corner of streets.
- Hot soymilk and youtiao in the morning. (How can I go back to cereal?)
- Chinese gardens.
- Being violently elbowed by ninety-year old Chinese women to get on the bus.
- The complete lack of any safety railings at national resorts.
- Chinese people telling me how annoying it is that there are so many Chinese people.
- Little white dogs with dyed fluorescent green or orange ears. This may be particular to my road in Nanjing, but I see it a lot.
- Cheap books.
- The lines, oh god, the lines. (Or should I say, the complete lack of any concept of what the word "line" should mean?)
- And, most of all, I'm going to miss all of my Chinese friends and my Chinese family so much I try not to think about it. I highly recommend China to everyone, I have so many great memories from my year here.
