Tell Laura I Love Her 告訴蘿拉我愛她

Laura and Tommy were lovers
He wanted to give her everything
Flowers presents and most of all
A wedding ring

He saw a sign for stock car race
A thousand dollar prize it read
He couldn't get Laura on the phone
So to her mother Tommy said
Tell Laura I love her Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may be late
I've something to do that can not wait

He drove his car to the racing ground
He was the youngest driver there
And the crowd roared
As they started the race
Round the track they drove at a deadly pace
No one know what happened that day
How his car overturned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath
They heard him say
Tell Laura I love her Tell Laura I need her

Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her will never die
Now in the chapel Laura prayed
For her Tommy who passed away
It was just for Laura
He lived and died
Alone in the chapel
She can hear him cry

Tell Laura I love her......

蘿拉和湯米是情侶
他什麼都想送給她
花　禮物和她最想要的一枚婚戒
他看到了一張賽車啟事
獎金有一千元
他打電話找不到蘿拉
所以告訴他媽媽說
告訴蘿拉我愛她　告訴蘿拉我需要她
告訴蘿拉我或許慢一點到
我要做一件不得不做的事情
他駕著車到賽車場
他是最年輕的賽車選手
當比賽開始觀眾大聲歡呼
他們以死亡的速度在場上奔馳
沒有人知道那天發生了什麼
他的車在拐彎處著火
當他們把他從扭曲的車拉出時
他氣息微弱地說
告訴蘿拉我愛她　告訴蘿拉我需要她
告訴蘿拉不要哭　我對他的愛誓死不渝
現在蘿拉在教堂禱告
為去世的湯姆禱告
他為蘿拉活也為蘿拉死
孤寂的教堂　她似乎又聽到他的呼喚
告訴蘿拉我愛她...
