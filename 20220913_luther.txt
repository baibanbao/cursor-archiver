学习雅各的经验

为什么当发生饥荒的时候，雅各没有眼睁睁等着天上掉吗哪，而是让自己的儿子们到埃及去籴粮？

马丁路德的回答是既然神已经给你了机会，那就要抓住机会，不要去试探神

Why did Jacob tell his sons, “Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die”? Why didn’t he trust God’s promise to protect and take care of him? Why was Jacob afraid of dying when, up to now, he had experienced God’s help and guidance throughout his life? God had protected him, his entire family, and all his servants in the foreign country of Canaan. Why did he stop trusting God’s promise when it was still fresh in his mind? He had always taught his children about God’s promise. Where is your faith now, Jacob? Where is the promise? Here is how I reply to these questions: God orders us to believe and trust in his goodness, but at the same time, we should never test him. We must take advantage of opportunities that God gives us. If we don’t, we aren’t living according to his plan. But we must continue to maintain our faith and hope in God. That’s why Jacob didn’t say, “Stay here and wait. The Lord is powerful enough to make food fall right out of the sky. Maybe that’s the way he will choose to feed us.” No, that’s not what God’s promise means. There’s no doubt that God can take care of you in a miraculous way. But you must not pass up opportunities that could provide the help you need. If you don’t use what is readily available to you, then you are testing God. Jacob was careful not to test God. He didn’t sit idly at home, hoping to get food some other way.

路德还举过主耶稣受撒旦试探，让他从高处跳下来的例子。
> 路德说，既然爬上这个建筑是有台阶的，那就是神给你的方法，你要抓住，而不是试探主，让主使用神迹。
