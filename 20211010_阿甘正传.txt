Task 1. Read the text and be ready to retell in class. Thomas J . Hanks

Born in Concord, California on July 9, 1956 Thomas J. Hanks was the third of four children of Amos and Janet Hanks. His parents divorced when young Tom was 5 years old. Tom was raised by his father along with siblings Sandra (born in 1951) and Lawrence (Larry, born in 1953). Tom's younger brother, James (Jim, born in 1961), was raised by their mother and grew up separated from the other Hanks children for the first several years of his life.

Tom Hanks' father married twice more after divorcing Tom's mother and moved often until settling down in 1966. With a new job and a new marriage Amos Hanks set up house in Oakland, California. There young Tom was able to stay, attending both junior high and high school without another move to a new school. His years in Oakland saw Tom Hanks develop into a young man. His interests were normal for the time: space (his heroes were astronauts) and sports, especially baseball. It was here that his talent for comedy was first noticed.

After high school and with acting and theater still a big part of his life, Tom Hanks attended Chabot College in nearby Hayward, California from 1974 to 1976. After his two years at Chabot College, Tom transferred to California State University at Sacramento. While at Cal State, Tom worked building sets for the university productions and met Susan Dillingham who would

Tom Hanks' father married twice more after divorcing Tom's mother and moved often until settling down in 1966. With a new job and a new marriage Amos Hanks set up house in Oakland, California. There young Tom was able to stay, attending both junior high and high school without another move to a new school. His years in Oakland saw Tom Hanks develop into a young man. His interests were normal for the time: space (his heroes were astronauts) and sports, especially baseball. It was here that his talent for comedy was first noticed.

After high school and with acting and theater still a big part of his life, Tom Hanks attended Chabot College in nearby Hayward, California from 1974 to 1976. After his two years at Chabot College, Tom transferred to California State University at Sacramento. While at Cal State, Tom worked building sets for the university productions and met Susan Dillingham who would

later take on her stage name - Samantha Lewes - and become

Tom Hanks'first wife.

1977 saw a move to Cleveland and the end of college for Tom Hanks. He began work as an intern for the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival that spring. He was working with professional actors for the first time. Since the tour of the company went on until December of 1977, Tom Hanks missed the fall semester at Cal State. He never went back to college, choosing instead to pursue acting in the theater. Between seasons with the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, Tom worked at the Civic Theater in

Sacramento building sets, rigging lights and running shows. When he returned to Cleveland in the summer of 1978 for the next season of the Festival, he won the role of Proteus in the production of Two Gentlemen from Verona. That performance garnered Hanks the Cleveland Critics Circle Best Actor Award. At the end of the 1978 season in Cleveland, Tom and Samantha headed for New York armed with little but his acting award and a desire to break into the big time.

Now 22 years old, Tom Hanks lived in Hell's Kitchen and married Samantha who had given birth to Tom's first son, Colin. Work as a performer in New York was practically non-existent sending Tom back to Cleveland in the spring of 1979 for his final season with the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival. Back in New York in late 1979, Tom auditioned for the Riverside Shakespeare Theater production of The Mandrake and won the lead role of Callimaco. He also took on a manager, Joe Ohla with the J. Michael Bloom

Agency in Los Angeles. The agency got Tom his first film role in He Knows You're Alone for the Screen Actors Guild minimum pay rate of $785 a week.

In January 1980, ABC Television began a Talent Development Program designed to discover and develop new talent for the network. Tom attended multiple auditions, surviving cut after cut in the program and wowing Jan McCormackand Joyce Selznick. They gave Tom, now 23 years old, a $50,000 contract and a

chance to audition for the pilot of Bosom Buddies. Tom Hanks won the role of Kip Wilson and began his new television career at ABC in the fall season of 1980 earning $5,000 an episode.

Tom moved his family to the San Fernando Valley in California. In 1982, Ron Howard was developing a new film for Touchstone Pictures, a new division of Disney, and was looking to cast the lead role. Howard remembered Tom Hanks from his guest shot on Happy Days after having difficulty with casting the male lead for the movie Splash. He gave the role in the $9 million dollar production to Tom and with it a chance for Hanks to make a name for himself on the big screen. Production began in 1983. Splash was released in January 1984 to good reviews and great box office and things for Tom Hanks began to change significantly.

Instead of sparse guest roles on television, Tom Hanks was now a hot actor who had proved he could make a big budget film that would succeed. He had a new manager with the famous William Morris Agency and was getting noticed in Hollywood. His next film was another box office success, Bachelor Party, released in late 1984. Remembering lean times in New York and with a home and family to provide for, Tom Hanks began work on six films over the next four years. The work schedule was grueling and kept him away from home where his marriage with Samantha Lewes was becoming increasingly strained.

In 1985 he filmed The Man With One Red Shoe, Volunteers, and The Money Pit. On the set of Volunteers, he met Rita Wilson. Tom's friendship with Rita would develop into much more after 1988 but at that time provided a respite from the hustle of an active career and the hassle of an unhappy home life. In an attempt to support his wife and perhaps save his marriage, Tom spent time early in 1985 producing, directing and even building the sets for a small play by Steve Tesich called The Passing Game at the Gene Dynarski Theater. Samantha co-produced and performed in the play. The marriage did not survive and by the end of 1985 the couple had separated.

That same year Tom earned his first $1 million paycheck for a film role when he went to Israel to make Every Time We Say Goodbye. The film was a critical disappointment but proved thaft Tom Hanks could be a romantic leading man in a serious drama. The following year Tom made Dragnet, a commercial success but another critical disappointment.

Tom and Rita married in 1988 on April 30th. Tom's first blockbuster hit came with the release of Big, a film that grossed over $100 million in American box office. The film was directed by Penny Marshall, who cast Tom as the boy in a man's body Josh Baskin.

A wonderful, whimsical performance netted Tom his first Best Actor Oscar nomination in 1989.

The decision to return to films after a two-year break brought with it a new management company, Mike Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency, and the choice to return to the successful direction of Penny Marshall. Tom Hanks won the role of Jimmy Dugan, a drunk and down and out baseball manager, in A League of Their Own. The release of A League of Their Own began what has been a non-stop string of wonderfully crafted and successful films, i 993 saw the release of Sleepless in Seattle, Tom's first collaboration with Nora Ephron and his second film with Meg Ryan, and Philadelphia, the film that would earn him his second Oscar nomination for Best Actor. That year also saw Tom branch out

from acting and take a stab at directing.

What followed would be nothing less than legendary. Tom Hanks went on to win the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Andrew Beckett, an attorney suffering from AIDS, in Philadelphia in 1994. That same year he filmed Forrest Gump, Toy Story (doing a voiceover performance as Woody for the animated feature) and Apollo 13 (his second collaboration with Ron Howard). The role of Forrest Gump would bring another Oscar nomination for Best Actor and his role of Jim Lovell, NASA astronaut, in Apollo 13 allowed him to return to his childhood passion for space. Forrest Gump

man to win back to back Best Actor Oscars (Spencer Tracy being the first to do so) taking home his second gold trophy for Forrest Gump. 1995 also brought Tom Hanks an unusual and historic honor. That year he was named the Hasty Pudding "Man of the Year" by the Harvard,Lampoon. To round out 1995, the fourth of Tom's children, Truman, was born the day after Christmas. The busy year of 1996 saw the release of Apollo 13 and the production of Tom's first feature directorial effort That Thing You Do!

In 1997, Tom traveled to Europe to film the Steven Spielberg war epic Saving Private Ryan. His portrayal of Capt. John Miller would earn Hanks his fourth Best Actor Oscar nomination in 1999. The shoot was grueling but Tom was committed to honoring the WWII veterans who fought the war on the Normandy coast on D-Day. So much so that Tom wentto boot camp and along with the seven other actors who would portray an eight man squad sent to find Pvt. James Ryan in the film, endured a week of long marches,

little sleep, standard military rations as food, push-ups and the incessant cold. Saving Private Ryan was released in the summer of 1998 and became a worldwide phenomenon.

The year 2000 was a busy one for Tom. He filmed the movie Cast Away in two parts with a now legendary break in the midst of filming so that he could lose 55 pounds for the role of a (one survivor who spends four years on an island before rescue. During the summer of 2001 Tom filmed Road to Perdition, breaking out

of the good guy role mold to portray a mafia hitman. Road to Perdition was released on July 12,2002. In 2001, Tom Hanks was named as the next recipient of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award. He is only the 30th person to receive this honor. The award was given on June 12, 2002.

2002 saw Tom's production company, Playtone, release My Big Fat Greek Wedding.

Task 2. Read to answer the following questions:

1. Is Robyn Wright's career in Hollywood typical of many actresses?

2. Why did she reject scripts for Jurassic Park, The Firm, Batman Forever, and Sabrina?

3. How has Robin side-stepped Hollywood's expectations?

4. What traits of character help people become successful

professionals?

Robin Wright

Raised by her divorced mother, a Mary Kay Cosmetic executive, Robin Wright fell into acting at the urging of her modeling agent. Strangely, she had only taken up modeling in order to finance a month-long trip to Europe. Her primary goal at the time was to live in a Third World country and be a nurse to poor and dying children.

Fate had other plans, and after winning a role on the soap Santa Barbara, Rob Reiner cast her in his film The Princess Bride in 1987. Although this role got the attention of Hollywood, the offers that followed were hardly what Robin had hoped for. She was not about to be type-cast as an English princess. Robin Wright

prefers roles that depict women as "heroines or powerful anti- establishment women" as she put it in a 1996 interview with Hilary De Vries; the types of roles that appeal to her feisty Independent nature. For this reason, scripts for Jurassic Park. The Firm, Batman Forever, and Sabrina to name a few, all ended up on her reject pile. Robin has continuously side-stepped Hollywood's expectations and has chosen to take the low road to stardom with such films as Denial, Loved, Moll Flanders and She's So Lovely. Yet, in spite of her strong mindedness,

Hollywood continues to love Robin, and it is only a matter of time before one of those low-profile, non-mainstream films wins her the attention and respect of a much larger audience.

At present, Robin lives with husband and fellow thespian Sean Penn and their two children; daughter Dylan and son, Hopper, in Santa Monica.

Robert Zemeckis

Biography from Baseline's Encyclopedia of Film

Born in Chicago, IL in 1952; educated at Northern Illinois University and USC, Los Angeles (film). Gifted producer-writer-director of zesty if fairly traditional Hollywood entertainments. With a flair for cutting edge special effects and an impressive track record for eliciting strong performances, Zemeckis is the star graduate of the Spielberg School of Genre Filmmaking. After directing and co-writing several small projects which Spielberg produced, he demonstrated that he could also helm blockbusters of his own. This billion-dollar director of nostalgic period pieces, fast-paced adventures, and eye-popping fantasies also displays a penchant for the macabre, as displayed in the popular TV series "Tales

From the Crypt".

While studying filmmaking at USC, Zemeckis met kindred soul and future screenwriting partner Bob Gale. While many of their peers genuflected before European art films, the Two Bobs grooved to American genre fare. The team made their feature debut with / Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), a cheery romp about early Beatlemania, with Zemeckis directing and Steven Spielberg debuting as executive producer. They also collaborated on the

script of 1941 (1979), Spielberg's poorly received WWII comedy. Neither their first film nor their enjoyably adolescent followup Used Cars (1980) stimulated much box-off ice action; they did, though, get the attention of Michael Douglas, who hired Zemeckis to helm

the hit romantic adventure, Romancing the Stone (1984). With Gale producing and co-writing, Zemeckis directed the immensely popular, clever, and surprisingly poignant Back to the Future (1985). He and Gale also provided a surprisingly hard-boiled action script for Walter Hill's riveting Trespass (1992).

Without his partner, Zemeckis crafted Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), a bravura example of integrating live action with animation and a major blockbuster for Disney and Amblin. He has also branched out into producing for network TV ("Johnny Bago", CBS 1993) and features (The Public Eye, 1992). After the relative commercial disappointment of Death Becomes Her (1992) - a

gruesome comic showcase for Meryl Streep, and Goldie Hawn - Zemeckis took on an unusual project. With the sometimes fanciful and often moving comedy-drama Forrest Gump (1994), the skillful toymaker proved that he could successfully tackle a large-scale story that foregrounded human elements. Adapted from the book by Winston Groom, the film has been described as essentially a picaresque novel for the screen as it covers three tumultuous decades in the life of America as seen through the innocent eyes of a child-like Southerner. Tom Hanks delivered a bravura performance in this critical and commercial hit which seamlessly integrated special effects within a realistic storyline. For his efforts

Zemeckis was rewarded with his first Oscar. More recent credits in directing / producing include What Lies Beneath, Cast Away (both 2000) and Ritual (2001).

on American Language, History and Culture via the film Forrest Gump

Task 4. Read the review to retell and discuss the statement: "Forrest's simplicity and small outlook on life is such a blessing for him." Is there a notion of the wise or holy fool in your culture?

Forrest Gump

"Forrest Gump" is a very special movie, a movie in which so many values, traditions, historical.events and occurrences are all seen through the eyes of one man who is affected by all of the above mentioned aspects of life. This man is the very embodiment of American innocence in a time when that innocence was fading from sight, with such events as the Vietnam War and segregation

issues plaguing the country.

The film is a complex and stunning journey that involves many characters, all of whom represent a separate and unique stereotype of the 50's, 60's and 70's. The events portrayed throughout the movie are handled with meticulous detail and through the eyes of Forrest Gump, we see everything in a new light. His simplicity and limited education seem more of a blessing than a curse, and it may cause viewers to look at their own lives and take stock of themselves as well. Forrest begins his journey as a skinny child who must wear leg braces for his crooked

back. His mother will do just about anything for him, including giving special favors to the public school principle in order to get her son enrolleekpn his first day of school, he meets a young girl named Jenny, whom he falls in love with at first sight. He will carry this love with him for the rest of his life, protecting her from her abusive father and staying by her side through their school years. His high school career offers him a position

on football team, which leads him to college, where he becomes' ensconced in many different cultures and beliefs, as well as his first taste of segregation. Jenny begins to branch off into more risky lines of work, evolving into the drifter hippie that so

symbolized the 6 0 s . Forrest stays in touch with her, even after he is drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight in the war. There, he meets Bubba Blue, and they become fast friends due to their ostracization from the rest of the group's men. Their commanding officer, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, is harsh and strict,

so it comes as no surprise that when a battle goes terribly wrong, he loathes Gump for pulling him out instead of leaving him to die. From this point on, Forrest will become a national hero as

well as someone that every human being, decent or loathsome, can come to admire.

Forrest's simplicity and small outlook on life is such a blessing for him, and that is shown through the plot of this movie. He sees everything going on around him, but none of it ever really registers in his mind the way it would someone of a higher IQ. Forrest lives his life the way a child would that has been taught by his mother

the values of life, and Forrest holds extremely true to those values, never breaching them for a second. His small outlook on such a vast melting pot of societal woes becomes the way in which we

would like to look at the world, and at ourselves.

Tom Hanks gives his best and most memorable performance ever in this film. He plays Gump with all the simple-mindedness and naivety that the movie needs, and brings such vivid and emotional life to the movie. We believe in his ability to create such beautiful images with his simple words. Robin Wright plays his girl, Jenny, who has a profound effect on us despite her many

mistakes in her life. Throughout the movie, she seems to be wanting something more than just the popular scene and lifestyle, and Wright brings all of that out with vivacity and excellence. Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, and his embittered attitude towards his country prove to be quite a challenge for Sinise, who readily accepts and makes the role his own.

"Forrest Gump" works on so many different levels of emotion, intensity and passion for life that it becomes a success many times over. It will not soon be forgotten, so long as we all look for a way to better simplify the events of our lives, seeing things with the naivety of a small boy who rose to such heights of fame yet never really realized his social status. To him, it did not matter; he was just living life.

Answer the questions:

1) How would you describe Forrest to a friend? What are his best features?

2) What were the most important historical events that Forrest and Jenny lived through?

3) How were the lives of Forrest and Jenny different?

4) This film shows much of the social change that the United States went through between the 1950s and the 1980s.

Did your country go through similar changes?

5) What did you like and not like about this movie?

Task 5. Read and retell the following article by Rebecca Ascher-Walsh, discuss the example of some other famous actor or actress who had kept fame at arm's length until they starred in a blockbuster hit.

Stage Veteran Gary Sinise Storms Hollywood with a Searing Performance in Forrest Gump

Gary Sinise (pronounced suh-NEESE) is a scarred man. "This is from training for the Vietnam scenes in Forrest Gump," he says, touching a thin line on the white, marred underside of his right arm. "This," he continues in his nasal Chicago drawl, drawing his finger-along a lower, deeper gash, "is from a fight scene in The Grapes of Wrath. And this," he adds, lingering on a fresh, pink scratch, "is from playing with my children." The 39-year- old actor-director may have kept fame at arm's length until now,

but thanks to his turn as Lieutenant Dan, Tom Hanks' surly

Vietnam commander in Forrest Gump-following his starring ro in ABC's high-rated May miniseries of Stephen King's The Stand* Hollywood is paying attention. "I've never done anything that anyone's ever seen before," he says, nervously shifting in his

seat at a Pasadena eatery as the waiter circles like a shark, trying unsuccessfully to place Sinise. It's not easy. His most notable work has been in the theater, which, he says, "I probably never would have started in if I were interested in fame and fortune. When I think of work, it's mostly about having control over your destiny, as opposed to being at the mercy of what's out there." The question of destiny is at the heart of Sinise's character in Forrest Gump, as well, a person who feels he should have died in battle rather than live on as a double amputee. The

character turns from a driven military man into a raging alcoholic who ultimately reclaims his life. While special effects erased Sinise's legs in some scenes, Gump director Robert Zemeckis says, "Thetrue illusion is 80 percent Gary's performance." Sinise also went to South Carolina, where under the eye of Vietnam vet and film consultant Dale Dye, he led his movie platoon for three days across leech-filled marshes. "It was amazing to be in a

jungle and have it totally dark, and suddenly machine guns are going off. People took it seriously."

In 1974 Sinise cofounded the Steppenwolf Theatre Company - famous for its high-octane, physical acting style - and was joined by Laurie Metcalf, John Malkovich, and actress Moira Harris, Sinise's wife since 1981. After first winning notice for his Steppenwolf productions, Sinise earned a Tony nomination for his 1990 Broadway role as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath; later that year, John Steinbeck's widow, Elaine, granted him the rights to direct an Of Mice and Men remake. The critically acclaimed film looked like his big break, but then, for the next

year, nothing, only occasional parts in marginal films. Sinise is determined to change that. Praise does little to soothe Sinise's occasional sense of being a newcomer. Nor does his newly won role, again opposite Hanks, as an astronaut in Ron Howard's Apollo 13. "I have that insecure acting thing, and the more it

sets in, the more it feels like you've been found out. Now, it's good," he says cautiously. "But in time, it will be somebody else's turn. That's the way it's always been."

"The question of destiny is at the heart of Sinise's character in Forrest Gump." Do you think everybody has a destiny, or we all are self-made people?

• Could you see Forrest Gump as being an allegory implying God or angels who look out for the simple and the pure of heart?

Task 6. Read the review and answer the questions asked in the essay.

"No Box of Chocolates": The Adaptation of Forrest Gump

This essay appeared in Literature/Film Quarterly 25.1(1997)

Like Chance the Gardener in Being There, Forrest is the creation of his audience, a Nowhere Man positioned at the center of an historical tableau, the gooey nougat at the heart of a video sampler. Ironically, the fictional scenario which that 1979 film so skillfully satirized, in which a mentally incompetent man rises to popular acclaim, became the political reality of 1994, the Year of Gump. That this picaresque tale of an idiot has been taken straight

(picaros have traditionally been satirical figures) tells us all we need to know about the death of irony in our culture. The metamorphosis of Forrest Gump the novel into Forrest Gump the film (1994) rises questions that are central to not only an understanding of the film's tremendous popularity but to any assessment of the current state-of-the-art and go right to the heart of our postmodern era.

In an interview broadcast on CNN, novelist Winston Groom has insisted that he was not troubled by the changes screenwriter

Eric Roth made in adapting the book of Forrest Gump for the screen. He would not hesitate, he insisted, to have another of his books adapted by Hollywood. Certainly some of the changes are understandable and logical.

Obviously it was not possible, with Tom Hanks cast in the central role, to make Forrest Gump 6 ft, 6 inches tall and weighing 245 pounds. And the logic of making Forrest a shrimp boat captain rather than a very-uncinematic shrimp farmer is easy to accept.

Time constraints also shaped the screenplay. In its present form, Forrest Gump is, at 142 minutes, already a very long film. As is almost always the case in the adaptation of any complex novel to the screen, a great deal of cutting was needed. And so in the movie we do not get to experience Forrest Gump become a professional wrestler, spend time in a mental hospital, save Mao

Tse-tung from drowning, journey into outer space, live with a cannibal, become a masterful chess player, play the monster in a remake of Creature from the Black Lagoon, or run for the United States Senate.

Forrest Gump's adaptation nevertheless raises persistent questions:

Why change "Being an idiot is no box of chocolates" to "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you'll get"?

Why make Forrest a devoted and loving son? In the novel, Forrest Gump ignores his mother for years on end. While he is in Vietnam, the family house burns to the ground, and his mother eventually ends up in the poorhouse, which causes Forrest no great distress. In the film, Forrest Gump is resolutely faithful to his mother; he literally comes running when he learns she is ill; and he is at her bedside when she dies and grieves long and hard over her passing.

Her sacrifices on his behalf give him a chance in life (enable him, for example, to be mainstreamed at school), and her wisdom ("Stupid is as stupid does", "Life is like a box of chocolates") provides the guidance by which Forrest steers his life.

Why make Bubba an African American? In Groom's novel, Forrest's buddy Bubba is white, and they meet at the University of Alabama, where he and Forrest are members of the football team. The filmic Forrest meets Bubba, an African American man with a distended lower lip, on the bus on the way to basic training for the army. In both novel and film, Bubba makes possible Forrest's ventures in the shrimp business. In the film, however, Biyou la Batre, Louisiana's shrimp business is a largely African American enterprise, and Forrest's triumphant success (after a

hurricane wipes out his competition) is at the expense of the other Black shrimpers. (Later, of course, he gives a sizeable percentage of his money to Bubba's family.)

Why make Forrest and Dan close, life-long friends? In Forrest Gump the movie, Lieutenant Dan is Forrest Gump's commanding officer and is saved (against his will) by Forrest Gump's heroism when he carries him away from a Vietnamese fire fight. In the novel, however, Dan is not Forrest's commanding officer, nor does Forrest save him in battle (he meets him later in the hospital).

Why is Forrest made smarter in the movie? Why make young Forrest crippled as a child? Why make Forrest a devoted and loving son? Why make Bubba an African American?

Why make Forrest into a college graduate?

Why have Forrest enlist in the Army instead of being drafted?

Why have Forrest save Lieutenant Dan's life?

Why make Forrest and Dan close, life-long friends? Why have Lieutenant Dan lose his legs but not become badly scarred?

Why have Lieutenant Dan become reborn? Why have Forrest and Jenny marry?

Why have Forrest raise his child by Jenny? Why have Jenny die?

Why change "Being an idiot is no box of chocolates" to "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you'll get"?

Why make Forrest a devoted and loving son? In the novel, Forrest Gump ignores his mother for years on end. While he is in Vietnam, the family house burns to the ground, and his mother eventually ends up in the poorhouse, which causes Forrest no great distress. In the film, Forrest Gump is resolutely faithful to his mother; he literally comes running when he learns she is ill; and he is at her bedside when she dies and grieves long and hard over her passing.

Her sacrifices on his behalf give him a chance in life (enable him, for example, to be mainstreamed at school), and her wisdom ("Stupid is as stupid does", "Life is like a box of chocolates") provides the guidance by which Forrest steers his life.

Why make Bubba an African American? In Groom's novel, Forrest's buddy Bubba is white, and they meet at the University of Alabama, where he and Forrest are members of the football team. The filmic Forrest meets Bubba, an African American man with a distended lower lip, on the bus on the way to basic training for the army. In both novel and film, Bubba makes possible Forrest's ventures in the shrimp business. In the film, however, Biyou la Batre, Louisiana's shrimp business is a largely African American enterprise, and Forrest's triumphant success (after a

hurricane wipes out his competition) is at the expense of the other Black shrimpers. (Later, of course, he gives a sizeable percentage of his money to Bubba's family.)

Why make Forrest and Dan close, life-long friends? In Forrest Gump the movie, Lieutenant Dan is Forrest Gump's commanding officer and is saved (against his will) by Forrest Gump's heroism when he carries him away from a Vietnamese fire fight. In the novel, however, Dan is not Forrest's commanding officer, nor does Forrest save him in battle (he meets him later in the hospital). In the movie, Dan loses his legs in combat, but in the book he has not only lost his legs but is horribly scarred by

burns received in combat. In the novel, Dan becomes a grotesque character in an American tradition stretching back to Poe's "The Man Who Was Used Up" and plays a distant and ironic role in Forrest's life. The last time we meet him, he has become a bitter communist. In the film, Gary Sinise's Dan serves first as Forrest's mentor, then, after struggling with his own despair and depression and plunging into a life of drunkenness and debauchery, learns

the will to live from the indomitable Forrest. His service on Forrest's shrimp boat turns his life around and gets him "back on his feet," so to speak. At film's end, he has acquired a new pair of prosthetic legs and (happily) married an Asian woman.

It would be tempting to suggest that all the changes from novel into film listed here were in fact the result of marketing decisions. After all, we live in an age in which movies are tried out on test groups in order to ascertain, prior to release, what exactly

A Hollywood movie is like a box of chocolates: it tastes good, but it's really bad for you. Of course, it isn't bad to eat a small amount of chocolates; likewise, not all Hollywood movies are bad for you. But after seeing Forrest Gump, the charming aphorism that was central to the film ("My momma says that life is like a box of chocolates") metamorphosed in my mind in this fashion.

The by-now-well-known special effects that make Tom Hanks appear in old newsreel footage and play championship ping-pong, and that make Gary Sinise's legs disappear, are outstanding. Hanks adds another finely crafted

audiences want. I do not mean to suggest, however, that Gump's distortions were the result of such pandering.

Forrest

Forrest Gump's $149 million dollar US box office and $480.9 million box office world wide were supposedly a complete surprise. They should not have been. Virtually every decision made in altering Winston's Groom's novel for the screen - from Forrest's heroic (and very cinematic) overcoming of his childhood handicap, to his very un-90s moral uprightness, to his Hallmark Greeting Card good son persona, to his politically correct and southern-

stereotyp^-defying friendship with an African American, to his inspirational influence on the courageously handicapped (but not deformed) Lieutenant Dan, to the Love Story death of the child- abused Jenny, to Forrest's "new male" single-fathering - can be seen in retrospect as a kind of self-censorship-for-profit reconceptualizing of a Cand/cte-like novel, appropriate to the era

of the death of irony.

Task 7. Read the review by Aeon J . Skoble and discuss whether Forrest Gump is really a subversive film. What is the main message of the film?

Forrest Gump: A Subversive Movie

(The Foundation for Economic Education, Inc., July 1995, Vol. 45, No. 7)

A Hollywood movie is like a box of chocolates: it tastes good, but it's really bad for you. Of course, it isn't bad to eat a small amount of chocolates; likewise, not all Hollywood movies are bad for you. But after seeing Forrest Gump, the charming aphorism that was central to the film ("My momma says that life is like a box of chocolates") metamorphosed in my mind in this fashion.

not only grows in popularity, but the associated merchandising increases. One can buy collections of Gump sayings, tins of "BubbaGump Shrimp,"'Gump t-shirts, and so on. As the film's appeal grows, so does the need to examine its message. The movie won six Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Actor for Tom Hanks) - so the film is clearly an influential social and cultural item.

Before criticizing the film's vices, I first praise its virtues. It is very well executed. The by-now-well-known special effects that make Tom Hanks appear in old newsreel footage and play championship ping-pong, and that make Gary Sinise's legs disappear, are outstanding. Hanks adds another finely crafted

performance to his resume. The film's narrative structure is tight, and strikes the right balance between serious drama and light comedy. Indeed it is truly an excellent film, in the sense that it tells a story well and conveys a message. But the values portrayed, like a box of chocolates, are too sweet and not entirely healthy.

This film is subversive. It doesn't subvert the Constitution of the United States, but rather it is subversive of the human spirit. This claim will come as a spoilsport voice-in-the-wildemess to the many who are trumpeting the film as a triumph of the human spirit.

Forrest Gump is unambiguously anti-intellectual, and subversive in its power to make one enjoy it anyway.

The naive innocent who prospers in a wicked world is an old standard, and a very seductive device. Even Wagner, after announcing the coming of the superman, found refuge in this archetype in Parsifal. Here Hanks portrays a man with an IQ of 75 who becomes a national hero and a millionaire through... what? The purity of his spirit and the grace of God, or something like

that. The message is that intelligence, indeed ability generally, are unimportant. Providence will watch out for those without gifts, therefore everyone is gifted. Some of Gump's achievements are due to his being a nice guy. He wins the Medal of Honor for rescuing his company because he is unwilling to abandon his

friend. But he becomes a great runner by divine fiat. His shrimp boat survives a hurricane. He becomes a champion ping-pong player simply by not taking his eye off the ball. It's not quite like Being There, to which this film is frequently compared. The character Chance in Being There receives his fortunes through the misinterpretations of his idiocy by a sick society, hence the

satire. Gump is satire-free. But the film makes us ask, what's the point of having talents if talent is unimportant?

The film not only portrays talent as unimportant, but literally as an impediment to the good life. Consider the intelligent and intellectually curious Jenny. She is an independent thinker who questions authority and social standards, and who is experimental and adventuresome. Jenny is punished with a series of abusive relationships; she finally dies of AIDS. I've rarely seen a

characterization so hostile to inquiry. It is revealed that the roots of her eagerness to question authority and think independently are having a dysfunctional family. So an evil force drives her to independence of thought, and the results of the consequent life are drugs, abusive boyfriends, and AIDS.

The contrast with Gump is clear enough. His mother loves him. He always does as he's told, and prospers as a result. In response

to the command, "just run," he is able to score touchdowns. This trait also makes him a natural for military service. To be sure that we do not interpret all this as anti-Christian, Jenny, despite her sins, is forgiven and rewarded in the afterlife in the form of a

perfect child conceived with Forrest. When Lieutenant Dan loses his legs, he rails against God, but when he makes his peace with God, he walks again.

Gump's mother, played well by Sally Field, keeps admonishing him that he's no different from everyone else. The film insistently advances the idea that there is "nothing wrong with being stupid." Honestly, could there b e a more dangerous message to promulgate? It should go without saying that people should not be cruel to those with less ability, and we may indeed wish to care for those incapable of taking care of themselves. But is there really nothing wrong with being less able, less smart? This is not about self-esteem for the disabled, it is actually about

radical leveling, a devaluation of ability. How is Gump no different from anyone else? This claim seems innocent enough, and might follow from the idea that those of less ability are still humans deserving respect and dignity. But of course he is different - he is a great runner, a football star, a war hero, a millionaire. Most of us are none of those things. And he has a 75 IQ, which most of us don't have either. So he is different from most people. By downplaying that, the critique of ability

is made more subtle.

There's no secret to excelling, the film tells us, just do what you're supposed to do. In real life, people must earn their achievements. Of course, some steal and some inherit, but in general, people have to achieve through their efforts. At any rate, that would be a better lesson to teach, I submit, than that if you just blunder about, God or fate will take care of everything. No ability is necessary to

make a fortune in the shrimp business - just make sure that your shrimp boat is the only one left intact after a hurricane. No ability is necessary to be a football hero - just run until they tell you to stop running.

Of course, all these bits in the film are funny and charming. I laughed and smiled on cue with everyone else. Hanks is always likable, and Gump especially so, being the sweet innocent that

tie is. But I am disturbed that a film could attain such popularity and appeal by advancing the view that ability is not an important component of business success and that critical thinking is not essential to achieve prosperity. Despite Gump being a successful businessman, the film thereby conveys a tacit anti-commerce message.

The anti-commerce message derives from the more general anti- ability theme. If intelligence and analytic ability are not portrayed in the most popular film of the year as important components of the good life, an intellectually lazy generation will tacitly take this

as support for their disengaged condition. The majority of teens cannot locate the Pacific Ocean on a world map, or the Civil War by half-century. The fastest growing trend in criminal defense is diminished responsibility. Books are out, MTV is in. Critical reasoning is on the decline not only as a skill but as a desideratum.

And now comes Forrest Gump to reinforce the idea that we are not responsible for our destinies, that intelligence is not important, that independent thought will be punished. That's dangerous.

Forrest Gump is not a bad film, but it is subversive. The film is subversive because it is so well made and enjoyable. I enjoyed it even as I was aware of the unhealthiness of its message. If anyone tells me that it was a good film, or that he or she enjoyed it, I won't disagree. But if anyone tells me that it was profound or that it changed his life, I shall weep.

popular films being turned into a commercial bonanza. PLANET "GUMP"

You have seen Tom Hanks movie and used the catchphrases. Now you can down the food. The latest installment in the Forrest Gump phenomenon; the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurant, which opened March 29, 1995 in the coastal tourist town of Monterey, Calif., and may be just the first of many Forrest food joints. The 200-seat theme eatery - a co-venture of Paramount Pictures and the California-based Rusty Pelican restaurant chain - features all things Gump, including a replica of Forrest's famed

bench, Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis' production notes, and the requisite gift shop (plush shrimp toys are among the knickknacks for sale).

As for the menu, well, it certainly lives up to the name. "We won't have as many kinds of shrimp as talked about in the movie," says Rusty Pelican restaurant CEO Scott Barnett, "but we'll have a big selection." Main courses, which are priced from $6 to $16, include such Gump-inspired dishes as Lt. Dan's Drunkin Prawns and Championship Ping Pong Salad, though the peas and carrots Forrest was always talking about are not yet on the menu. So far, diners are eating it up. "The first few days exceeded our wildest expectations," says Gump Shrimp Co. general manager Dave Trombetta. "We have

consistently had two-hour waits and a line to get in."

And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields?"

And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields?"

2. Do you agree with Ebert that Forrest Gump is a meditation or* our times: "The movie is more of a meditation on our times, a§ seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes i things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being "too clever by half." Forrest is clever by just exactly enough?"

3. Do you agree with Ebert's explanation for why Forrest Gump is a magical movie: "Between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie?"

4. Do you think that Ellen Goodman is being too cynical in her characterization of Forrest Gump: "Is there a message here? If he's good, is it because he doesn't have the brains to be bad or bitter?"

5. What do you think the Director of Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis, means by this characterization of Forrest Gump: "Because Forrest Gump is a pure and simple individual without any opinions or politics, he can travel through a tapestry of American images spanning three decades, reflecting back the mayhem and the madness that's going on around him?"

6. Do you agree with film reviewer Hal Hinson that Forrest Gump is simply an idiot, who ''doesn't direct his life in the way that most characters do and has no real motives or drives or psychology" and "aside from his mother's folksy aphorisms, Gump believes in nothing and stands for nothing"?

7. What do you think is the role of Forrest Gump's mother's sayings, which some critics call gumpisms, throughout the movie? Are we supposed to take such sayings as "Stupid is as stupid does" and "Life is a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get" seriously?

8. What does Forrest Gump's mother mean when she says: "You make our own destiny. You have to do the best with what God gave you"?

9. Why does Forrest Gump begin and end with the same feather floating in the wind? How does this feather help open and close the movie?

10. Why does Jenny seem to jump from one failed experience to the next, wandering across America trying to find herself and the meaning of her life?

11. Do you think that Forrest Gump is sincere when he tells Jenny, "I am not a smart man, but I know what love is"? What evidence do we have that Forrest really knows what love is?

12. Why does Forrest Gump spend over three years running back and forth across the nation? What does Forrest Gump mean when he says: "You've got to put the past behind you before you can move on. That's what my running was about"?

13. Do you think both Jenny and Lieutenant Dan finally make peace with their lives? Why does Jenny go back to Forrest and marry him?

14. How does this statement by Forrest Gump at Jenny's grave help us understand the larger meaning of the film: "Jenny, I don't know if Momma was right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything you need, I won't be far away?"

15. What allows Forrest Gump to survive all the turmoil and agony of life between the 1950s and the 1990s? Is Gump really just a man without character and understanding, who just floats through life like a feather "accidentally floating on a breeze"?
