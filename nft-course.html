<div class="class_s6S">In brief:</div>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that are provably unique, creating digital scarcity. They can't be duplicated or divided.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">They have many use cases, including for digital collectibles, music, artwork, and in-game tokens.</li>
</ul>
<div id="a1ED" class="heading_s72">What Is Fungibility?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Fungible means changeable. It is proven that fungible assets are actually the odd ones out. A currency is a classic example <span id="page_7"></span>
 of a fungible asset. Five dollars is always five dollars no matter the serial number on the specific five-dollar bill, or whether its five dollars sitting in your bank account. The ability to replace a five-dollar bill with another five-dollar bill (or five ones, for that matter) is what makes currency fungible. Fungibility refers to an asset's ability to be exchanged with a similar asset without sacrificing its value. Fungibility also defines an asset's characteristics, such as divisibility and value.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For example, one $10 dollar bill is identical to another $10 dollar bill in terms of value. As such, when you borrow a $10 dollar bill from someone, you don't have to return the exact same note, since another of its kind has the same value.</div>
<div class="class_s7F">
<div class="class_s7D">
<div class="class_s7B">
<div class="class_s79-1"><img src="Image00003.jpg" alt="" class="class_s79-0" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">In the cryptocurrency sector, one BTC has the same value as any other BTC. However, the game changes when we cross over to non-fungible tokens. An NFT crypto token has a distinct value from any other similar token. Individual characteristics dictate their uniqueness, hence, they are non-fungible, much like real-world assets like rare stones, works of art and collector luxury items.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Note that <span class="class_s1AE">fungibility is relative</span>
 ; it really only applies when comparing multiple things. Consider business class, economy class, and first-class flight tickets. Each ticket is roughly fungible <span class="class_s1AE">within its class</span>
 , but you can’t fairly swap a first- class ticket for a business class ticket. Even the chair you’re sitting in is roughly fungible with a chair of the same model, unless you’ve developed a special attachment to your <span class="class_s1AE">particular</span>
 chair.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Interestingly, fungibility can also be subjective. Back to the flight ticket example, a person who cares about sitting in a window seat and an aisle seat might not consider two economy class tickets interchangeable. Similarly, a rare penny <span id="page_8"></span>
 might be worth 1 cent to me but worth much more to a coin collector. We’ll see that some of these nuances become important when representing these items on blockchains.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens, privacy tokens… digital assets and their classifications are multiplying and evolving right alongside cryptographic and blockchain technology.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are another example of the fast-paced change in the industry. In this guide we explore what they are, how they work, and how they're being used.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique, digital items with blockchain- managed ownership. Examples include collectibles, game items, digital art, event tickets, domain names, and even ownership records for physical assets.</div>
<div class="class_s75">If you’ve been living in the crypto world for a while, you’ve likely heard of the term “Non-Fungible Token”, or “NFT”. Maybe you’re a doubter, a believer, or perhaps you still don’t really know what exactly a non-fungible token is. In any case, this ebook is for you!</div>
<div class="class_s75">As a marketplace for NFTs, ‘OpenSea’ has a unique viewpoint. We have seen nearly every NFT-related project that has come online since late 2017 - when the first NFT standard emerged. In fact, we’ll bet you a <span class="class_s1AU">Gods Unchained</span>
</div>
<div class="class_s75">

 ERC721, the history of the NFT, common misconceptions about NFTs, and the current state of the NFT market. We hope it will be relevant both to folks who are new to the space, as well as those who already know about NFTs but want to better understand the nuances of their inner workings.</div>
<div class="class_s75">A non-fungible token (NFT) is a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique. One NFT cannot be interchanged with another NFT, and the whole cannot be broken down into smaller parts and used. NFTs offer myriad options for creating and trading digital assets — such as original artwork and blockchain-integrated collectible games like CryptoKitties. NFTs are useful for proving the scarcity and provenance of rare assets, both digital and real-world.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens are mainly built on Ethereum using the ERC-721 token standard.</div>
<div id="a1DN" class="heading_s72">What Are Fungible Tokens?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Fungible tokens are tokens that are tradable for each other, and their value remains constant. In the above example, Bitcoin is a fungible token because it has the same value regardless of its owner or history.</div>

<div id="page_10">What is a non-fungible token?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">‘Non-fungible assets’ are just normal stuff. On the other hand ‘Fungible assets’ are the odd ones out!</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens are digital assets that contain identifying information recorded in smart contracts.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s this information that makes each NFT unique, and as such, they cannot be directly replaced by another token. They cannot be swapped like for like, as no two NFTs are alike. Banknotes, in contrast, can be simply exchanged one for another; if they hold the same value, there is no difference to the holder between, say, one dollar bill and another.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are digital assets that represent a wide range of unique tangible and intangible items, from collectible sports cards to virtual real estate and even digital sneakers.</div>
<div class="class_s75">One of the main benefits of owning a digital collectible versus a physical collectible like a Pokemon card or rare minted coin is that each NFT contains distinguishing information that makes it both distinct from any other NFT and easily verifiable. This makes the creation and circulation of fake collectibles pointless because each item can be traced back to the original issuer.</div>
<div id="page_11" class="class_s75">A non-fungible token (NFT) is a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique. NFTs offer myriad options for creating and trading digital assets — such as original artwork and blockchain-integrated collectible games like CryptoKitties.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Unlike regular cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be directly exchanged with one another. This is because no two NFTs are identical – even those that exist on the same platform, game or in the same collection. Think of them as festival tickets. Each ticket contains specific information including the purchaser’s name, the date of the event and the venue. This data makes it impossible for festival tickets to be traded with one another.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The vast majority of NFT tokens were built using one of two Ethereum token standards (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) – blueprints created by Ethereum that enable software developers to easily deploy NFTs and ensure they’re compatible with the broader ecosystem, including exchanges and wallet services like MetaMask and MyEtherWallet. Eos, Neo and Tron have also released their own NFT token standards to encourage developers to build and host NFTs on their blockchain networks.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Other key characteristics of NFTs include:</div>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Rare:</span>
 The value of NFTs comes from their scarcity. Although NFT developers can create any amount of non-fungible tokens, they often limit the tokens to increase rarity.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Non-interoperable:</span>
 A CryptoPunk cannot be used as a character on the CryptoKitties game or vice versa. This goes for collectibles such as trading cards, too; a Blockchain Heroes card cannot be played in the Gods Unchained trading-card game.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Indivisible:</span>
 NFTs cannot be divided into smaller denominations like bitcoin satoshis. They exist <span id="page_12"></span>
 exclusively as a whole item.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Indestructible:</span>
 Because all NFT data is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts, each token cannot be destroyed, removed or replicated. Ownership of these tokens is also immutable, which means gamers and collectors actually possess their NFTs, not the companies that create them. This contrasts with buying things like music from the iTunes store where users don't actually own what they’re buying, they just purchase the license to listen to the music.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Verifiable:</span>
 Another benefit of storing historical ownership data on the blockchain is that items such as digital artwork can be traced back to the original creator, which allows pieces to be authenticated without the need for third-party verification.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Unique:</span>
 This is perhaps the most significant characteristic of them all. NFTs have a permanent information tab that records their uniqueness. Think of this information as a certificate of authenticity.</li>
</ul>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_s6M">
<div class="class_s6J-0"><img src="Image00004.jpg" alt="" class="class_s6J-1" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">
<span class="class_s1A6">Bitcoin</span>
 <span id="page_13"></span>
 is a fungible token. You can send someone one Bitcoin and they can send one back, and you still have one Bitcoin. (Of course, the value of Bitcoin might change during the time of exchange.) You can also send or receive smaller amounts of one Bitcoin, measured in satoshis (think of satoshis as cents of a Bitcoin), since fungible tokens are divisible.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens are not divisible, in the same way that you cannot send someone part of a concert ticket. Part of a concert ticket wouldn’t be worth anything on its own and would not be redeemable.</div>
<div class="class_s75">
<span class="class_s1A6">CryptoKitties</span>
 collectibles were some of the first non-fungible tokens. Each blockchain-based digital kitten is unique; if you send someone a CryptoKitty and receive a CryptoKitty from someone else, the one you receive will be a completely different CryptoKitty from the one you sent. Collecting different digital kittens is the point of the game.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The unique information of a non-fungible token, like a CryptoKitty, is stored in its smart contract and immutably recorded on that token’s blockchain. CryptoKitties were originally launched as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, but have since migrated to their own blockchain, Flow, to be easier for crypto newcomers to access.</div>
<div class="class_s9F">
<div class="class_s9D">Did you know?</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s9K">
<div class="class_s9H">In late 2018, one player was so desperate to move to a "better location" in the virtual game <span class="class_s1AE">“Decentraland”</span>
 that they were ready to say goodbye to 2,800,000 MANA in order to purchase a land piece in-game. At the time of the deal, that was equivalent to over $215,200.</div>
</div>
<div id="a1D9" class="heading_s72">What makes NFTs so special?</div>
<div id="page_14" class="class_s6S">Non-fungible tokens have unique attributes; they are usually linked to a specific asset. They can be used to prove the ownership of digital items like game skins right through to the ownership of physical assets.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Other tokens are fungible, in the same way as coins or banknotes. Fungible tokens are identical, they have the same attributes and value when exchanged.</div>
<div id="a1BU" class="heading_s72">How are non-fungible tokens used?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">As well as for crypto-collectibles like CryptoKitties, non-fungible tokens can be used for digital assets that need to be differentiated from each other in order to prove their value, or scarcity. They can represent everything from virtual land parcels to artworks, to ownership licenses.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens are not traded on standard cryptocurrency exchanges, instead they are bought or sold on digital marketplaces like Openbazaar or Decentraland’s LAND marketplace.</div>
<div id="a1EF" class="heading_s72">How do NFTs work?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum-basedERC-20 tokens are fungible. Ethereum’s non-fungible token standard, as used by platforms such as CryptoKitties and Decentraland, is ERC-721. Non-fungible tokens can also be created on other smart-contract-enabled blockchains with non-fungible token tools and support. Though Ethereum was the first to be widely used, NEO, EOS and TRON now have NFT standards.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens and their smart contracts allow for detailed attributes to be added, like the identity of the owner, rich metadata, or secure file links. The potent of non-fungible <span id="page_15"></span>
 tokens to immutably prove digital ownership is an important progression for an increasingly digital world. They could see blockchain’s promise of trustless security applied to the ownership or exchange of almost any asset.</div>
<div class="class_s75">As is the challenge of blockchain to date, non-fungible tokens, their protocols and smart contract technology is still being developed. Creating decentralized applications and platforms for the management and creation of non-fungible tokens is still relatively complicated. There is also the challenge of creating a standard. Blockchain development is fragmented, many developers are working on their own projects. To be successful there may need to be unified protocols and interoperability.</div>
<div id="a1BA" class="heading_s72">How to buy NFT tokens?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Non-fungible tokens can be purchased on a huge number of NFT marketplaces, including Rarible, OpenSea, and Enjin Marketplace. Here's how to get your digital hands on some using <span class="class_s1A6">Rarible</span>
 :</div>
<div class="class_s75">
<span class="class_s1A6">Step 1</span>
 : Head over to the Rarible website and click the 'Connect' button on the top right. From here, select the wallet you want to connect to the platform and log in.</div>
<div class="class_sA2">You'll need to accept the terms of service before you can log in.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In our example, we'll connect using Metamask, a popular web and mobile wallet.</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_sA9">
<div id="page_16" class="class_sA7-1"><img src="Image00005.jpg" alt="" class="class_sA7-0" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">
<span class="class_s1A6">Step 2:</span>
 Once logged in, search the platform for the NFT you're looking to purchase.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In our example, we'll show how you might purchase 'Hand of Fate' by Jango. The process will be similar regardless of which NFT you wish to purchase (assuming it is available to purchase outright).</div>
<div class="class_s75">Once you've selected the NFT you wish to purchase, click the 'Buy now' button.</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_s6M">
<div id="page_17" class="class_s6J-0"><img src="Image00006.jpg" alt="" class="class_s6J-1" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">
<span class="class_s1A6">Step 3</span>
 : A confirmation window will pop up, asking you to double-check the details of the order.</div>
<div class="class_s75">If you're happy to continue, click the 'Proceed to payment' button to move ahead to the final step.</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_sA9">
<div id="page_18" class="class_sA7-1"><img src="Image00007.jpg" alt="" class="class_sA7-0" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">
<span class="class_s1A6">Step 4</span>
 : Your wallet click will then pop up asking you to confirm the transaction. Again, if you're happy to continue, simply confirm the transaction and it will be processed.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Once it has confirmed, your NFT will be deposited directly to your Ethereum address and will be yours to keep.</div>
<div class="class_s75">
<span class="class_s1A6">Note</span>
 <span id="page_19"></span>
 : you may want to avoid buying your NFTs during peak times—otherwise you may end up with an inordinately high gas fee (as per our example below).</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_sB2">
<div class="class_sB0-1"><img src="Image00008.jpg" alt="" class="class_sB0-0" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a1BV" class="heading_s72">How do you know your NFT is authentic?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">NFT ownership is recorded on the blockchain, and that entry acts as a digital pink slip. Defining the blockchain is a whole ‘nother can of worms’.</div>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">Where is the blockchain? It’s <span class="class_s1AE">decentralized</span>
 , so it exists across many people’s computers in encrypted bits and <span id="page_20"></span>
 pieces.</li>
</ul>
<div id="a1DJ" class="heading_s72">Why would I want to own an NFT? Can I make money on it?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">One reason to buy an NFT is for its emotional value, which isn’t so different from physical objects...unless you’re a total utilitarian. No one buys lip gloss because they need it. They buy it for the way it makes them feel. The same can be true for a GIF, image, video, or other digital asset.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The other reason is because you think it’s valuable...and will only increase in value. And yes, you can make money off of an NFT by buying and reselling it for more.</div>
<div id="a1F9" class="heading_s72">Are NFTs new?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">They’re newly popular, but not new. Andrew Steinwold traces their origins all the way back to blockchain-backed Colored Coins in 2012, but they didn’t move into the mainstream until CryptoKitties had everyone buying virtual cats in 2017.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Recently, as Google search trends indicate, interest in NFTs has exploded. The creators of CryptoKitties started Top Shot, a platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade NBA highlights, and digital artwork is now being auctioned by Christie’s.</div>
<div id="a1AY" class="heading_s72">Top NFT Projects</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Since the NFT subspace is growing exponentially, NFT-focused products and projects have also increased. They range from gaming networks to NTF marketplaces. Below are five of the top NFT projects today.</div>
<ol class="class_s70-1">
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">OpenSea:</span>
 <span id="page_21"></span>
 This is the leading marketplace for NFT art and collectibles. Listed items range from ENS to virtual pets and plots of land. Notably, the marketplace allows purchases using several virtual currencies such as ETH and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/" class="class_s1DA">DAI</a>
 .</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Async.Art</span>
 : Async is another non-fungible token artwork marketplace that allows you to not only buy and sell your NFT but also to create one. That's not all. The platform has some programming features that enable art creators to easily define their artwork's appearance and behavior. In fact, it even allows buyers to buy sections or "layers" of a given artwork and customize them.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">CryptoKitties:</span>
 Although we've discussed this project above, it still deserves to be on the list of top NFT projects considering it brought the whole NFT game to the limelight.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Ethereum Name Service (ENS):</span>
 This is a domain name service project that came to life in mid-2017. The .ETH domain names are NFTs using Ethereum's ERC-721 standards and are tradable on NFT marketplaces.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">Decentraland:</span>
 Decentraland is a top NFT project focusing on a distributed virtual world. Here, participants can buy virtual land. Furthermore, each “inhabitant” has a special identifying digital passport.</li>
</ol>
<div id="a1AV" class="heading_s72">Who's making waves in the NFT space?</div>
<div class="class_sBY">Terra Virtua</div>
<div class="class_s75">A major emerging market for NFTs is the creation of digital collectibles—similar to physical trading cards, they derive value from their scarcity. Numerous brands have started licensing their content for use in digital collectibles; one of the <span id="page_22"></span>
 companies at the forefront of the movement is Terra Virtua.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Terra Virtua bills itself as the "home of digital collectibles," enabling fans to create a digital "Fancave" where they can display their NFT assets. In September of this year, the company released a series of licensed NFTs inspired by the Godfather film trilogy.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Decentraland</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTs are increasingly making their presence felt in the gaming space, too. Decentraland is the world's first fully decentralized game world, built on the ERC-20 token MANA. Users can spend MANA to buy goods, services and 10x10m plots of virtual land, underpinned by the non-fungible LAND token. Decentraland's ICO for the MANA token initially raised $20.7 million and sold out within five minutes. A subsequent auction of LAND saw users spend 161 million MANA to buy virtual plots—around $15 million at current prices.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The game world itself is similar to Minecraft; simple blocky graphics and user- generated creations, which include everything from art galleries (where NFTs can be displayed) to simple games built within the game world.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Decentraland supports a number of different NFTs in addition to LAND, including Axie Infinity and the ever-popular CryptoKitties.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">NFTs and DeFi</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens are also making waves in one of cryptocurrency’s most intriguing and innovative spaces, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</div>
<div class="class_s75">One example of how NFTs are being used in DeFi is Aavegotchi, an experimental startup funded by DeFi money market Aave. Aavegotchis are NFT crypto-collectibles used in <span id="page_23"></span>
 a game universe; every Aavegotchi also has Aave's aTokens staked inside them as collateral, meaning that each one generates yield on Aave. If the owner liquidates their stake, the Aavegotchi disappears.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Another service that's aiming to bridge the DeFi and NFT communites is Rarible, a decentralized app (or dapp) that enables users to sell digital artwork in the Rarible market.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In July 2020, Rarible launched RARI, a governance token that's used to reward creators and collectors; it can only be earned through active participation on the platform, a process Rarible terms "marketplace liquidity mining."</div>
<div id="a1DG" class="heading_s72">Why they're important:</div>
<div class="class_s6S">NFTs have become hugely popular with crypto users and companies alike because of the way they revolutionized the gaming and collectibles space. Since November 2017, there has been a total of $174 million spent on NFTs.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Thanks to the advent of blockchain technology, gamers and collectors can become the immutable owners of in-game items and other unique assets as well as make money from them. In some cases, players have the ability to create and monetize structures like casinos and theme parks in virtual worlds, such as The Sandbox and Decentraland. They can also sell individual digitals items they accrue during gameplay such as costumes, avatars and in-game currency on a secondary market.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For artists, being able to sell artwork in digital form directly to a global audience of buyers without using an auction house or gallery allows them to keep a significantly greater portion of the profits they make from sales. Royalties can also be programmed into digital artwork so that the creator receives a <span id="page_24"></span>
 percentage of sale profits each time their artwork is sold to a new owner.</div>
<div class="class_s75">William Shatner, best known as Captain Kirk from “Star Trek,” ventured into digital collectibles in 2020 and issued 90,000 digital cards on the WAX blockchain showcasing various images of himself. Each card was initially sold for approximately $1 and now provides Shatner with passive royalty income every time one is resold.</div>
<div id="a1BW" class="heading_s72">Advantages of NFTs</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Non-fungible tokens bring a new dimension to digital interactions. The three leading advantages of NFTs are:</div>
<ol class="class_s70-1">
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">They're transferable</span>
 – Unlike exchange-traded fungible tokens, NFTs are bought or sold on special marketplaces. However, their value depends on their uniqueness.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">They're authentic</span>
 – Blockchain technology powers non-fungible tokens. Therefore, you know that your NFT is genuine, since it’s nearly impossible to create counterfeits with a decentralized immutable ledger.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<span class="class_s1A6">They preserve ownership rights</span>
 – Again, this refers to an NFT’s use of decentralized platforms where no owner can alter the data once committed.</li>
</ol>
<div id="a1D3" class="heading_s72">Why do they have value?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Like all assets, supply and demand are the key market drivers for price. Due to the scarce nature of NFTs and the high demand for them from gamers, collectors and investors, people are often prepared to pay a lot of money for them.</div>
<div id="page_25" class="class_s75">Some NFTs also have the potential to make their owners a lot of money. For instance, one gamer on the Decentraland virtual land platform decided to purchase 64 lots and combine them into a single estate. Dubbed “The Secrets of Satoshis Tea Garden,” it sold for $80,000 purely because of its desirable location and road access. Another investor parted with $222,000 to purchase a segment of a digital Monaco racing track in the F1 Delta Time game. The NFT</div>
<div class="class_s75">representing the piece of digital track allows the owner to receive 5% dividends from all races that take place on it, including entry ticket fees.</div>
<div id="a1D6" class="heading_s72">What are the most expensive NFTs?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Dragon the CryptoKitty continues to be one of the most expensive NFTs in the space, valued at 600 ETH.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The one-of-a-kind “1-1-1” race car from F1 Delta Time sold for 415.9 ETH in May 2019.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Alien #2089 sold for 605 ETH in January 2021. This NFT is part of the CryptoPunk collection, the first NFTs ever created. Overall, there are 10,000 different CryptoPunks and only nine Alien CryptoPunks.</div>
<div class="class_s75">An NBA Topshot digital collectible card of basketball star LeBron James sold for $100,000.</div>
<div class="class_s75">An Axie named Angel from the NFT-based game Axie Infinity sold for 300 ETH. Most discussions about non-fungible tokens begin by introducing the idea of <span class="class_s1AE">fungibility</span>
 . As already defined in the pretext section that <span class="class_s1AE">fungibility</span>
 is defined as “able to replace or be replaced by another identical item”. This might be confusing. To get a better sense of what might constitute a non-fungible asset, just think about most of the stuff you own. <span id="page_26"></span>
 The chair you’re sitting in, your phone, your laptop, or anything you could go and sell on eBay, fall in the category of non-fungible things.</div>
<div class="class_s75">A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not mutually interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature.</div>
<div id="a1EN" class="heading_s72">Applications:</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Non-fungible tokens are used to create verifiable digital scarcity, as well as digital ownership, and the possibility of asset interoperability across multiple platforms. NFTs are used in several specific applications that require unique digital items like crypto art, digital collectibles, and online gaming.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Art was an early use case for NFTs, and blockchain in general, because of its ability to provide proof of authenticity and ownership of digital art that has otherwise had to contend with the potential for mass reproduction and unauthorized distribution of art through the internet. In February 2021 a hype started when US-American digital artist beeple's work "Everydays. The first 5000 days" was the first NFT artwork to be listed in one of the major auctions houses Christie's. A few days before, the meme animation Nyan Cat had been sold on an internet market place for 600,000 USD.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Later, popular blockchain games like CryptoKitties made use of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are used to represent in-game assets, and are controlled by the user, instead of the game developer. This lets the assets be traded on third-party marketplaces without permission from the game developer.</div>
<div id="a1DH" class="heading_s72">Standards:</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Specific token standards have been created to support the use of a blockchain in gaming. These include the Ethereum ERC-721 standard of CryptoKitties, and the more recent ERC-1155 standard.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">ERC-721 Standard</div>
<div class="class_s75">ERC721 was the first standard for representing non-fungible digital assets. ERC721 is an inheritable Solidity smart contract standard, meaning that developers can easily create new ERC721-compliant contracts by importing it from the OpenZeppelin library.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">ERC-1155 Standard</div>
<div class="class_s75">ERC1155, brings the idea of semi-fungibility to the NFT world as well as it provides a superset of ERC721 functionality, meaning that an ERC721 asset could be built using ERC1155.</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_s6M">
<div id="page_28" class="class_s6J-0"><img src="Image00009.jpg" alt="" class="class_s6J-1" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a1E1" class="heading_s72">Growth and mainstream appeal:</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Non-fungible tokens first became popular when CryptoKitties went viral and subsequently raised a $12.5 million investment. RareBits, a Non-Fungible Token marketplace and exchange, raised a $6 million investment. Gamedex, a collectible cards game platform made possible by NFTs, raised a $800,000 seed round. Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual world, raised $26 million in an initial coin offering,[17] and had a $20 million internal economy as of September 2018. Nike holds a patent for its blockchain-based NFT-sneakers called ‘CryptoKicks’.</div>
<div id="a1AT" class="heading_s72">Blockchain-based non-fungible tokens:</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Just as we had <span class="class_s1AE">digital currencies</span>
 (like airline points, in-game currencies), before <span class="class_s1AE">crypto</span>
 currencies emerged, we had had non-fungible digital assets since the dawn of the internet. Domain names, event tickets, in-game items, even handles on social networks like Twitter or Facebook, are all non-fungible digital assets. They just vary in their tradability, liquidity, and interoperability.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Many of these are incredibly valuable: Epic Games <span class="class_s1AU">made $2.4 billion in</span>
 <span class="class_s1AU">revenue selling costumes in their free-to-play game Fortnite in 2018 alone,</span>
 the market for event tickets is <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-online-event-ticketing-market" class="class_s1A7">projected to reach $68 billion in 2025,</a>

</div>
<div class="class_sDV">
<div class="class_s9H">We have tons of digital stuff, that we’ve never really possessed it.</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sDX">So it’s clear that we already have tons of digital stuff. But to what extent do we “own” these digital things? If digital ownership only means that an item belongs to you and not someone else, then you really own them in some sense. But if digital ownership is more like ownership in the physical world (the freedom to hold and transfer indefinitely), this doesn’t always seem to be the case with digital assets. Rather, you own these assets <span class="class_s1AE">in specific contexts</span>
 , which may or may not make moving them around easy. For instance, try to sell a Fortnite skin on eBay, and you’ll discover the difficulty of moving digital assets from one person to another.</div>
<div class="class_s75">This is where blockchains come in! Blockchains provide a coordination layer for digital assets, giving <span class="class_s1AE">users</span>
 ownership and management permission.</div>
<div id="page_30" class="class_s75">Blockchains add several unique properties to non-fungible assets that change the user and developer relationships with these assets.</div>

</div>
<div id="a1FG" class="heading_s72">Standardization</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Traditional digital assets—from event tickets to domain names—have no unified representation in the digital world. A game likely represents its in-game collectibles in an entirely different way than an event ticketing system. By representing non-fungible tokens on public blockchains, developers can build common, reusable, inheritable standards relevant to all non-<span id="page_31"></span>
 fungible tokens.</div>
<div class="class_s75">These include such basic primitives as ownership, transfer, and simple access control. Further information (specifications for how to display an NFT, for example) can be layered on top for rich display inside of applications.</div>
<div class="class_s75">These are similar to other building blocks of the digital world, like the JPEG or PNG file format for images, HTTP for requests between computers, and HTML / CSS for displaying content on the web. Blockchains add a layer on top that gives developers a brand new set of <span class="class_s1AE">stateful</span>
 primitives on which to build applications.</div>
<div id="a1AC" class="heading_s72">Interoperability</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Non-fungible token standards allow non-fungible tokens to move easily across multiple ecosystems. When a developer launches a new NFT project, these NFTs are immediately viewable inside dozens of different wallet providers, tradeable on marketplaces, and nowadays, displayable inside of virtual worlds. This is possible because open standards provide a clear, consistent, reliable, and permissioned API for reading and writing data.</div>
<div id="a1E2" class="heading_s72">Tradability</div>
<div class="class_s6S">The most attractive feature enabled by interoperability is free trade on open marketplaces. For the first time, users can move items outside of their original environments and into a marketplace where they can take advantage of sophisticated trading capabilities, like <span class="class_s1AU">eBay-style auctions</span>
 , <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/tutorials/how-to-bid-on-crypto-collectibles/" class="class_s1A7">bidding,</a>
 <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-bundles/" class="class_s1A7">bundling,</a>
 and the ability to sell in any currency, like <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/buy-and-sell-crypto-collectibles-with-dai/" class="class_s1A7">stablecoins an</a>

</div>
<div id="page_32" class="class_s75">For game developers specifically, tradability of assets represents a transition from a closed economy to an open or free-market economy. Game developers no longer have to manage every piece of their economy i.e. from the supply of resources to pricing to capital controls. Instead, they can let free markets do the heavy lifting!</div>
<div id="a1D5" class="heading_s72">Liquidity</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Instant tradability of non-fungible tokens will lead to higher liquidity. NFT marketplaces can supply to a variety of audiences—from hardcore traders to more beginner players—allowing for greater exposure of the assets to a wider pool of buyers. In the same way that the ICO boom of 2017 gave birth to a new asset class driven by instantly liquid tokens, NFTs <span class="class_s1AE">expand the market</span>
 for unique digital assets.</div>
<div id="a1D4" class="heading_s72">Persistence and provable scarcity</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Smart contracts allow developers to place hard checks on the supply of non- fungible tokens and enforce persistent properties that cannot be modified after the NFTs are issued. For example, a developer can enforce via programming that only a specific number of a specific rare item can be created, while keeping the supply of more common items infinite. Developers can also enforce that specific properties do not change over time by encoding them on- chain. This is particularly interesting for art, which relies heavily on the provable scarcity of an original piece.</div>
<div id="a1FB" class="heading_s72">Programmability</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Of course, like traditional digital assets, NFTs are fully <span id="page_33"></span>
 programmable. CryptoKitties (which we’ll talk about later) are baked in a breeding mechanic, <span class="class_s1AE">directly into the contract that represents the digital cats</span>
 . Many of today’s NFTs have more complex mechanics, like forging, crafting, redeeming, random generation, etc. The design space is full of possibilities.</div>
<div id="a1BD" class="heading_s72">What Are CryptoKitties?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">CryptoKitties is a popular game on the ETH-powered decentralized protocol allowing the collection, purchase, sale and breeding of virtual cats. Since its much-publicized launch in 2017 at the height of that year’s bull run, the game, essentially a blockchain version of 1990s cult classic Tamagotchi (in that same vein, check out DeFi’s Aavegotchi!) has continued to act as an NFT bastion.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Notably, CryptoKitties was the first mainstream use case on the second- largest blockchain that focused on leisure. In addition, the game opened the lid on the reach of decentralized applications (DApps) for recreational purposes. Upon its launch, CryptoKitties brought massive hype to Ethereum’s platform, which soon turned into a chorus of boos as the DApp’s popularity clogged the network, slowing down transaction confirmations and pushing up fees.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Using smart contracts, Kitties' owners and breeders can trade their virtual cats. They don’t only draw attention, but also serious money on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea.</div>
<div class="class_s75">If you are a cat lover and wondering how to buy CryptoKitties; it's easy. First, you need a Firefox or Chrome browser, a MetaMask wallet and some Ethereum (ETH) coins in the wallet. Next, access the Kitties' marketplace, choose your Kitty, pay, and it's yours.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Dapper Labs, creators of CryptoKitties, has recently followed <span id="page_34"></span>
 up their success with NBA TopShot, a digital collectibles marketplace for NBA fans.</div>
<div id="a1FW" class="heading_s72">What Are CryptoPunks?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">An obscure CryptoPunks “Alien” NFT made headlines in January 2021 when <span class="class_s1A6">it was sold</span>
 for a staggering $760,000 at the time, or 605 Ethereum. CryptoPunks are considered the original NFT series and its groundbreaking project predates both the ERC-721 standard and CryptoKitties. This has made it increasingly rare, with the average selling price for one in 2020 exceeding $6,000.</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a1EB" class="heading_sFA">Fungible and Non-Fungible Characteristics of Crypto Tokens:</div>
<div class="class_s6S">A fungible asset refers to an asset that is interchangeable with any other like unit of that asset. For example, one bitcoin is the same as any other bitcoin in circulation — the case is the same with dollars or euros or ether. Fungible assets are also divisible, meaning they can be broken up into smaller fractions of units that share the same properties. Fungible assets are essentially indistinguishable from one other. These traits are key for any asset to be viable as a payment mechanism. On the other hand, non-fungible tokens are crypto tokens that are indivisible and unique. While NFTs are built on smart contracts just like ETH and DAI, NFT contracts contain specific information that makes each NFT different from the next. In this way, one NFT cannot be interchanged with another NFT, and the whole cannot be broken down into smaller units and used. These traits denote non-fungibility.</div>
<div id="a1CD" class="heading_s72">NFTs Offer Options to Create and Trade Rare and Unique Digital Assets</div>
<div class="class_s6S">NFTs are provably scarce assets. Each non-fungible token contains code that indicates it is the only asset with its specific <span id="page_36"></span>
 digital identity. This is useful in creating unique digital goods, and can even be used to represent rare physical assets, whose provenance (historical record of ownership) can be tracked. The possibilities for exclusive and rare items that can be traded — such as digital art, collectibles, or game pieces — are endless. Platforms like Open Sea, Super Rare, and Nifty Gateway bring NFTs to an ever-growing consumer base.</div>
<div id="a1A8" class="heading_sFF">Use Cases for NFTs Include:</div>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">Creating digital or crypto-collectibles</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Managing ownership of digital items within blockchain-integrated games</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Proving authenticity of digital art, while allowing artists to retain their copyright and IP</li>
</ul>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">Devising a digital identity system that allows users to control their data from one place</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Allowing fractional ownership of high-value items, such as real estate. The most popular application for NFTs to date is CryptoKitties, an Ethereum- based game that allows for the buying, selling, and breeding of adorable digital cats. CryptoKitties launched on November, 28, 2017, and within two weeks had over 150,000 users and $15 million in transactions. A single CryptoKitty was sold for $170,000, which made the platform a viral sensation, attracting a new audience of gamers to Ethereum along with global mainstream attention.</li>
</ul>
<div class="class_sDX">CryptoKitties was successful, but that success led to serious transaction congestion on the Ethereum network. The resulting scramble to accommodate network scalability — plus the large amounts of money being exchanged for digital cats — drove <span id="page_37"></span>
 many news organizations to cover CryptoKitties. This brought significant awareness to blockchain as a technology that offers more than just cryptocurrencies.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Furthermore use cases of NFTs can be enumerated as:</div>
<div id="a1D8" class="heading_s72">Gaming</div>
<div class="class_s6S">NFTs are popular in the gaming industry since these tokens solve some of its inherent problems. For example, top games such as Fortnite prohibit the sale of rare traits and accessories such as weapons and skins.</div>
<div class="class_s75">However, with NFTs, these features can easily be transferred and used in different games. As such, non-fungible tokens can help drive in-game economies.</div>
<div id="a1E3" class="heading_s72">Digital Assets</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Think of <span class="class_s1A6">Decentraland</span>
 . Here, participants can buy virtual land. Another example that is closer to home is ENS (Ethereum Name Service), which uses NFTs for its .ETH domains to facilitate buying and selling.</div>
<div id="a1EM" class="heading_s72">Identity</div>
<div class="class_s6S">NFTs are ideal for fighting identity theft. Examples of things that can be digitized to represent identity include academic qualifications, medical records and even our appearances.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Furthermore, digital artists can turn their work into NFTs for copyright purposes.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFT’s use to prove identity includes converting physical game <span id="page_38"></span>
 tickets into non-fungible tokens to weed out counterfeits.</div>
<div id="a1FD" class="heading_s72">Collectibles</div>
<div class="class_s6S">NFTs bring a new dawn to the collectible world. Consequently, conventional collectors are now onto digital assets.</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Standards are part of what makes non-fungible tokens powerful. They give developers the <span class="class_s1AE">guarantee</span>
 that assets will behave in a specific way and describe exactly how to interact with the basic functionality of the assets.</div>
<div id="a1F3" class="heading_s72">ERC721</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Pioneered by CryptoKitties, <a href="http://erc721.org/" class="class_s1A7">ERC721 w</a>
 as the first standard for representing non-fungible digital assets. ERC721 is an inheritable Solidity smart contract standard, meaning that developers can easily create new ERC721-compliant contracts by importing it from the <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol" class="class_s1A7">OpenZeppelin library (</a>
 we have a helpful tutorial on creating your first ERC721 contract <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/docs" class="class_s1A7">here)</a>
 . ERC721 is actually relatively simple: it provides a mapping of unique identifiers (each of which represents a single asset) to addresses, which represent the owner of that identifier. ERC721 also provides a permissioned way to transfer these assets, using the <span class="class_s1CB">transferFrom</span>
 method.</div>
<div class="class_sGS">
<div class="class_sGP">interface ERC721 {</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sGU">function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);</div>
<div id="page_40" class="class_sGU">function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;</div>
<div class="class_sGY">
<div class="class_sGP">}</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sDX">If you think about it, these two methods are really all you need to represent an</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFT; firstly a way to check who owns what and secondly a way to move things around. There are a few other unnecessary elaborated features to the standard (some of which turn out to be very important for NFT marketplaces), but the core of ERC721 is quite basic.</div>
<div id="a1DF" class="heading_s72">ERC1155</div>
<div class="class_s6S">
<a href="https://blog.enjin.io/erc-1155-token-standard-ethereum/" class="class_s1A7">ERC1155,</a>
 founded by the <a href="https://enjinx.io/" class="class_s1A7">Enjin t</a>
 eam, brings the idea of semi-fungibility to the NFT world. With ERC1155, IDs not only represent single assets but classes of assets. For example, an ID might represent “swords”, and a wallet could own 1,000 of these swords. In this case, the balanceOf method would return the number of swords owned by a wallet, and a user can transfer any number of these swords by calling transferFrom with the “sword” ID.</div>
<div class="class_sGS">
<div class="class_sGP">interface ERC1155 {</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sGU">function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (address);</div>
<div class="class_sGU">function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 quantity) external payable;</div>
<div class="class_sGY">
<div class="class_sGP">}</div>
</div>
<div id="page_41" class="class_sDX">One advantage of this type of system is efficiency: with ERC721, if a user wanted to transfer 1,000 swords, they would need to modify the smart contract’s state (by calling the transferFrom method) for 1,000 unique tokens. With ERC1155, the developer need only call transferFrom with quantity 1,000 and perform a single transfer operation. This increased efficiency, of course, comes with the loss of information: we can no longer trace the history of an individual sword.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Note also that ERC1155 provides a superset of ERC721 functionality, meaning that an ERC721 asset could be built using ERC1155 (you’d simply have a separate ID and quantity 1 for each asset). Due to these advantages, we’ve recently witnessed growing acceptance of the ERC1155 standard.</div>
<div class="class_s75">OpenSea recently developed a <span class="class_s1AU">repository on Github</span>
 for getting started with the ERC1155 standard.</div>

<div class="class_s98">Anatomy of the ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 standards. ERC20 maps addresses to amounts, ERC721 maps unique IDs to owners, and ERC1155 has a nested mapping of IDs to owners to amounts.</div>

<div class="class_s75">Composables, led by the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/998" class="class_s1A7">ERC-998 standard,</a>
 provide a template by which NFTs can own both non-fungible and <span id="page_42"></span>

<div id="a1FX" class="heading_s72">Non-Ethereum standards</div>
<div class="class_s6S">While Ethereum is where most of the action is currently happening, there are several other NFT standards emerging on other chains. DGoods, pioneered by the Mythical Games team, is focused on providing a feature-rich cross- chain standard starting with EOS.

</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">As mentioned, the ownerOf method provides a way to look up the owner of an NFT. For example, by querying ownerOf(1500718) on the CryptoKitties smart contract, we can see that the owner of CryptoKitty #1500718 at the time of writing is an account with the address 0x6452… This can be verified by visiting their CryptoKitty on OpenSea or on <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/1500718" class="class_s1A7">CryptoKitties.co.</a>
</div>

<div class="class_s98">But how do OpenSea and CryptoKitties figure out what CryptoKitty #1500718 looks like? And what about its name and unique attributes?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Hereafter we introduce <span class="class_s1AE">metadata</span>
 . Metadata provides descriptive information for a specific token ID. In the case of the CryptoKittty, the metadata is the name of the cat, the picture of the cat, a description, and any additional traits (called “cattributes”, in the case of CryptoKitties). In the case <span id="page_44"></span>
 of an event ticket, the metadata might include the date of the event and the type of ticket, in addition to a name and description. The metadata for the above cat might look something like this:</div>
<div class="class_s9F">
<div class="class_sGP">{</div>

<div class="class_sGP">}</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sDX">The question becomes how and where to store this data such that it can be accessed by applications that care about the NFT.</div>
<div id="a1F6" class="heading_s72">On-chain vs. off-chain</div>
<div class="class_s6S">The first decision, for developers, to take is what metadata to represent on- chain vs. off-chain. That is, do you bake the metadata directly into the smart contract representing the tokens, or do you host it separately?</div>
<div class="class_sC2">On-chain Metadata</div>
<div class="class_s75">The benefits of representing metadata on-chain are:</div>
<ol class="class_s70-1">
<li class="class_s6W">It permanently resides with the token, persisting beyond the lifecycle of any given application.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">
<div id="page_45">It can change in accordance with on-chain logic.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="class_sDX">Point #1 is important if assets are intended to have long-lasting value far beyond their original creation. For example, a piece of digital art is expected to persist throughout the ages, regardless of whether the original website that was used to create the art is still around. It therefore is important that its metadata persist alongside the lifecycle of the token identifier.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Additionally, on-chain logic may need to <span class="class_s1AE">interact with the metadata</span>
 . In the case of CryptoKitties, for example, the “generation” of the CryptoKitty influences how quickly a CryptoKitty can breed, and breeding all happens on- chain (higher generation cats bred more slowly). So the logic inside of the smart contract needs to be able to read the metadata from its internal state.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Off-chain Metadata</div>
<div class="class_s75">Despite these benefits, most projects store their metadata <span class="class_s1AE">off-chain</span>
 simply due to the current storage limitations of the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC721 standard, therefore, includes a method called tokenURI that developers can implement to tell applications where to find the metadata for a given item.</div>
<div class="class_sDV">
<div class="class_sGP">function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (string)</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sDX">The <span class="class_s1CB">tokenURI</span>
 method returns a public URL. This, in turn, returns a JSON dictionary of data, something like the example dictionary for the CryptoKitty above. This metadata should conform to the official ERC721 metadata standard for it to be picked up by applications like OpenSea. At OpenSea, we want <span id="page_46"></span>
 to give developers the ability to build rich metadata that can be displayed inside of our marketplace, so we’ve added extensions to the ERC721 metadata standard that allows developers to include things like traits, animations, and background colors.</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_sA9">
<div class="class_sA7-1"><img src="Image00013.jpg" alt="" class="class_sA7-0" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a1CS" class="heading_s72">Off-chain storage solutions</div>
<div class="class_s6S">If you’re storing your metadata off-chain, you have a couple of options:</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Centralized servers</div>
<div class="class_s75">The simplest way to store metadata is on a centralized server somewhere, or a cloud storage solution like AWS. Of course, this has disadvantages:</div>
<ol class="class_s70-1">
<li class="class_s6W">The developer can change the metadata accordingly.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">If the project goes offline, the metadata could disappear from its original source.</li>
</ol>
<div class="class_sDX">To solve problem #2 up to some extent, there are now several <span id="page_47"></span>
 services (OpenSea included) that will cache the metadata on its own servers in order to ensure that it can be efficiently served to users even if the original hosting solution goes down.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">IPFS</div>
<div class="class_s75">An increasing number of developers, particularly in the digital art space, are using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store metadata off-chain. IPFS is a peer-to-peer file storage system that allows content to be hosted across computers, such that the file is replicated in many different locations. This ensures that</div>

</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Now that we understand what non-fungible tokens are and how they can be built, let’s dive into their usage.</div>
<div id="a1CC" class="heading_s72">– 0 BC: Before CryptoKitties</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Experiments in NFTs began with the emergence of colored coins on the Bitcoin network. <a href="http://rarepepedirectory.com/" class="class_s1A7">Rare Pepes,</a>
 illustrations of the Pepe the Frog character built on the Bitcoin counterparty system, were among the first. Some of them actually sold on eBay, and a set of Rare Pepes later sold in a live public sale in New York.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The first Ethereum-based NFT experiment was <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks" class="class_s1A7">CryptoPunks,</a>
 which consisted of 10,000 unique collectible punks, each of which has a set of unique characteristics. Built by <a href="https://larvalabs.com/" class="class_s1A7">Larva Labs,</a>
 CryptoPunks featured an on-chain marketplace that could be used with wallets like <a href="https://metamask.io/" class="class_s1A7">MetaMask,</a>
 lowering the barrier to entry to interact with NFTs. Today, with their limited supply and strong brand among the early adopter community, CryptoPunks are likely the best candidates for true digital antiques. Additionally, the fact that punks live on the Ethereum network, makes them interoperable with marketplaces and wallets (though slightly less-so than newer assets, as they pre-<span id="page_49"></span>
 date the ERC721 standard).</div>

</div>
</div>
<div id="a1C5" class="heading_s72">0 BC: Birth of CryptoKitties</div>
<div class="class_s6S">
<a href="https://cryptokitties.co/" class="class_s1A7">CryptoKitties w</a>
 as the first most project to take NFTs to the middle-of-the-road. Launched in late 2017 at the ETH Waterloo hackathon, CryptoKitties featured a primitive on-chain game that allowed users to breed digital cats together to produce new cats of varying scarcity. “Generation 0” cats were auctioned off in a declining-price <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp" class="class_s1A7">Dutch auction,</a>
 and new cats could also be sold on a secondary market.</div>
<div class="class_s75">While some in the gaming community later labeled CryptoKitties “not a real game”, the team actually did quite a lot to launch on-chain game mechanics given the design constraints of the blockchain. For one, they built an on-chain breeding algorithm, hidden inside of a closed-source smart contract that determined the genetic code of a cat (which in-turn determined its “cattributes”). The CryptoKitties team even ensured the uncertainty of the breeding through a <a href="https://medium.com/cryptokitties/why-love-isnt-free-for-cryptokitties-7cc00dd2bf6d" class="class_s1A7">sophisticated incentive system a</a>
 nd had the anticipation to reserve certain low-ID cats for later use as promotional tools. Lastly, they pioneered a Dutch auction contract that later became one of the primary price discovery mechanisms for NFTs. The remarkable anticipation of the CryptoKitties team gave the NFT space a major boost, early in its life.</div>
<div id="page_50" class="class_s75">We think the spread of CryptoKitties can be boiled down into:</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Speculative mechanics</div>
<div class="class_s75">The breeding and trading mechanics of CryptoKitties led to a clear path to profit, buy up a couple of cats, breed them to make a rarer cat, flip the cat, repeat (or simply buy up a rare cat and hope that someone will come along and buy it). This fueled the growth of a <span class="class_s1AE">breeder community</span>
 . Users who were dedicated to breeding and flipping rare cats. As long as a new set of users come in and play the games, prices would rise.</div>
<div class="class_s75">At the height of the mania, CryptoKitties saw nearly 5,000 ETH in volume, with <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d/18" class="class_s1A7">Founder Cat #18 selling for 253 ETH (</a>
 $110,000 at the time of sale). This sale was later bested by the <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d/896775" class="class_s1A7">600 ETH sale of Dragon,</a>
 which was $170,000 at the time (September 2018), though many speculate that the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/" class="class_s1A7">Dragon sale was</a>
 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/" class="class_s1A7">illegitimate.</a>
 These high prices drew more users into the gold rush.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Viral story</div>
<div class="class_s75">Another piece of CryptoKitties’ success was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/" class="class_s1A7">the story.</a>
 CryptoKitties were adorable, able to be shared, and fun — and the idea of buying a $1,000 digital cat was so ridiculous that it made a great news story. Additionally, the smart contract’s overeager users “broke Ethereum”, which made for a story in and of itself. Since Ethereum can only process a limited number of transactions at a time (about 15 transactions/second), higher quantity on the network led to a growing pending transaction pool and increased gas prices. Daily average pending transactions rose from 1,500 transactions to 11,000 transactions.</div>
<div class="class_s75">New potential cat buyers were paying enormous fees and waiting hours on end for their transactions to be confirmed.</div>
<div class="class_s75">These factors led to the “CryptoKitty bubble”. New demand <span id="page_51"></span>
 entering the CryptoKitty world, prices rising, and rising prices bringing in new demand. Of course, all bubbles must eventually pop. In early December, average kitty prices started dropping and volume declined. Many realized that the CryptoKitties gameplay, which was primitive relative to “real games”, wouldn’t retain a wider audience beyond speculators. Once the innovation wore off, the market suffered. Today, CryptoKitties does around 50 ETH of volume per week.</div>

<div id="a1DK" class="heading_s72">2018: Hype, hot-potato games, and layer 2</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Despite the market decline, the early days of CryptoKitties provided a magical moment for many. Unprecedentedly, a team had deployed a non-financial blockchain-based application that made its way to the tech mainstream, although only for a few weeks. After CryptoKitties, NFTs underwent a second small hype cycle in early 2018 as investors and entrepreneurs started to think about a new way to own digital stuff.</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sN4">Layer 2 games and experiences</div>
<div class="class_s75">The era after CryptoKitties saw the onset of innovative <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-emerging-trends-in-the-blockchain-gaming-world" class="class_s1A7">“layer two” games</a>
 , games that were built on top of CryptoKitties by third-party developers with no link to the original CryptoKitties team. The magic of CryptoKitties was that these sorts of experiences could be developed “permmissionlessly”.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Developers could simply layer their own applications on top of the public CryptoKitty smart contract. CryptoKitties could, in some sense, take on a life of their own outside of their original environment. <a href="https://kittyrace.com/" class="class_s1A7">Kitty Race</a>
 , for example, allowed you to race your CryptoKitties against each other to win ETH, and <a href="https://kittyhats.co/%23/" class="class_s1A7">KittyHats</a>
 let users accessorize their CryptoKitties with hats and paintings. Later, <a href="https://wrappedkitties.com/" class="class_s1A7">Wrapped Kitties</a>
 combined Kitties and <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi-574c68ff43c4" class="class_s1A7">DeFi by</a>
 letting you turn your CryptoKitties into fungible ERC20 tokens to be traded on decentralized exchanges, which had all sorts of interesting ramifications for the CryptoKitty market. Dapper Labs (the newly founded company behind CryptoKitties) embraced these projects with the formation of the <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kittyverse" class="class_s1A7">KittyVerse</a>
 .</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sN4">Hot Potatoes</div>
<div class="class_s75">This era also witnessed the emergence of “hot potato” games. If you already know what a “hot potato” game is, you’re a true NFT OG. In January 2018, a game called CryptoCelebrities was launched. The mechanic was simple. First, buy a collectible celebrity NFT. Immediately, the celebrity becomes purchasable (or “snatchable”) for a higher price, some increment of the previous price. When someone buys your celebrity, you make the difference between your purchase price and the new purchase price (minus a developer fee). As long as there’s someone willing to buy your celebrity, you’ll profit.</div>
<div class="class_s75">However, if you’re caught as the last one holding the celebrity, you’ll be in for a loss.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The CryptoCelebrity mechanic turned out to be incredibly viral due to this speculative mechanic, with celebrities like <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xbb5ed1edeb5149af3ab43ea9c7a6963b3c1374f7/271" class="class_s1A7">Donald Trump</a>
 selling for astronomically high prices (123 ETH, or $137k at the time). While the CryptoCelebrity game likely harmed the space overall, we actually think experimentation with pricing and auction mechanics is an exciting piece of the design space for NFTs.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Venture Capital interest</div>
<div class="class_s75">Venture capital and crypto funds also grew curious about the NFT space in early 2018. CryptoKitties <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/cryptokitties-raises-12m-from-andreessen-horowitz-and-union-square-ventures/" class="class_s1A7">raised $12 million from top level investors and</a>

For example, the Enjin team released a “generic” (not for a specific game) <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xfaafdc07907ff5120a76b34b731b278c38d6043c/36411184310952944508859562575390614563768575651911745716961922930335654352507" class="class_s1A7">Oindrasdain Axe.</a>

 , with dozens of companion sites and marketplaces for buying, selling, and bartering. While the digital equivalents of Magic, like <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/" class="class_s1A7">Hearthstone</a>

Beneath the scratch-off area, purchasers would find a private key that held a small amount of ETH and a digital counterpart of the physical stamp, which they could then list for sale on OpenSea. The project was particularly interesting because it tied the shortage of the digital asset to a useful physical asset, and engaged an existing community of collectors.</div>

<div id="page_64">Non-fungible token myths</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Now that we’ve given an overview of the space, let’s talk about misconceptions.</div>
<div id="a1DD" class="heading_s72">Scarcity alone drives demand</div>
<div class="class_s6S">In the early days of the non-fungible token ecosystem, there was a belief that users would care about the provable shortage of NFTs, and that they would rush to buy NFTs simply because they were on a blockchain. Instead, we think demand is driven by more traditional forces i.e. <span class="class_s1A6">utility and provenance</span>
 . Utility is the obvious one: I’m willing to buy an NFT ticket because it lets me into a conference, I’m more willing to buy a piece of art if I can show it off in a virtual world, and I’m willing to buy an item if it gives me special abilities in a game. The concept of provenance encapsulates the story behind an NFT. Where did it come from? Who’s owned it in the past? As the space matures, the stories of interesting NFTs grow more complex and start to meaningfully impact a token’s value.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Smart contracts mean assets last forever</div>
<div class="class_s75">There was also the belief that just because a smart contract was deployed, the assets would last forever. This overlooked <span id="page_65"></span>
 the fact that there are other entities (websites, mobile apps) that serve as the portal for regular users to interact with these applications. If these portals go down, the assets lose a lot of their worth. Of course, there may be a future where decentralized applications can be deployed in a fully distributed, “unstoppable” way, but for now, we live very much in a hybrid world.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Abstracting the chain away will solve all our problems</div>
<div class="class_s75">In 2018 and 2019, some projects took the approach of “abstracting away the blockchain”, hiding all the mechanics of NFTs to users by providing a hosted wallet with username-password authentication. This was an interesting approach because it allowed for the same streamlined onboarding experiences as centralized applications. The problem was that the interoperability with the NFT ecosystem (virtual worlds, wallets, marketplaces) was lost. We’ve found that projects that plug into the existing NFT ecosystem and perhaps sacrifice some pieces of usability in the short term tend to be more attractive to the current community of early adopters.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Are We Ready for an NFT Bull Run?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Not yet. The current NFT hype has signs of fading away very soon. since most of it sits on artificial prices. Furthermore, there are concerns that wash trading is at play. For instance, a virtual cat from CryptoKitties had a selling price of 600 ETH coins, even though it had no rare traits to justify the high cost.</div>
<div class="class_s75">But despite all that, even if you aren’t interested in NFTs right now, don't turn your nose up quite yet — the ecosystem is changing, and just like DeFi, NFTs may become the next big thing in crypto. Besides, there are phenomenal investment opportunities in NFTs right now.</div>
<div class="class_s75">However, the uptake of these tokens lies in whether the next <span id="page_66"></span>
 generation of millennials will see their worth. Why? Because by the end of this decade, millennials will have a lot of idle income. And if they are previously predisposed to NFTs, they may consider investing in them. Furthermore, millennials are shifting from collecting physical goods like fine wine to virtual assets such as Bitcoin (BTC).</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s important to note that the NFT space is still in its infancy. Therefore, expect to see new platforms edge out the current batch of top NFT projects in 2021.</div>
<div class="class_s75">As of now, the term NFT is slowly moving away from visions of gaming and CryptoKitties to the painting, DeFi, ticketing, digital identity and other use cases.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In fact, its application scope is only limited to the imagination of the cryptocurrency community and developers.</div>

<div class="class_s6S">The market for non-fungible tokens is still quite small, and somewhat harder to measure than the cryptocurrency market given the lack of spot prices for assets. For the purpose of this analysis, we focus on secondary trading volume (i.e., peer to peer sales of non-fungible tokens) as an indicator of market <span id="page_68"></span>
 size. Using this metric, we estimate the current secondary market to be roughly <span class="class_s1A6">$2 – $3 million USD</span>
 in volume per month. In the last six months, the following projects led the charge:</div>

<div class="class_s98">Number of users interacting with NFTs, as defined by transferring, bidding on, buying, or selling. The market is early but steadily growing.</div>
<div class="class_s75">After the CryptoKitties bubble in late 2018, the number of unique accounts interacting with NFTs has grown slowly but steadily, from ~8,500 accounts in February of 2018 to over 20,000 accounts in December of 2019. The market seems to be driven by a core group of power users. On OpenSea, the median seller has sold $71.96 worth of stuff, whereas the average seller has sold <span class="class_s1A6">$1,178 worth of stuff</span>
 , indicating a <span id="page_69"></span>
 large number of power sellers. Note that big accounts like official game accounts do drive the average up. The average OpenSea buyer has bought <span class="class_s1A6">$943.81</span>
 worth of items and the median buyer has bought <span class="class_s1A6">$42.72</span>
 worth.</div>

 , which indicates a large number of power sellers.</div>
</div>
<div class="class_sDX">Given its earliness, probably the best way to measure the growth of the market is to look at a leading indicator: developer interest in the space. Over the last year, the number of mainnet ERC721 contracts has grown exponentially as new developers enter the space, hitting the 1,000s in June of 2019.</div>

<div id="a1C6" class="heading_s72">Sale Mechanisms</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Primarily NFTs are currently sold for ETH on decentralized exchanges. Surprisingly little trading happens in stablecoins like DAI or USDC, likely due to the friction of acquiring stablecoins. Dutch auctions and fixed-price sales are frequently used for selling lower-ticket items, while English (eBay-style) auctions are a frequent choice for larger-ticket items, like ultra-valuable Gods Unchained cards or legendary game items. Bundles are also a very popular sale mechanism, with the percentage of bundle sales steadily growing to 20% in December of this year.</div>
<div id="a1BB" class="heading_s72">NFT Distribution</div>
<div class="class_s6S">A question one might ask is, what’s the overlap between various NFT projects? Are communities around projects relatively isolated? (Gods Unchained players only play Gods Unchained), or is there a large bleed-over between communities? Is a CryptoKitties enthusiast also likely to own an ENS domain and participate in the digital art ecosystem?</div>

<a href="https://twitter.com/takenstheorem" class="class_s1A7">Takens Theorem</a>
 , an anonymous but very friendly Twitter account with some good analysis of the blockchain ecosystem, conducted an analysis of the overlap between various NFT communities. The above is a network diagram based on raw data from about 400,000 addresses on OpenSea. On the outer ring, each network is made up of addresses that uniquely own a single type of NFT. The number of nodes pictured represents the number of nodes in the actual data — for example, <span id="page_72"></span>
 thousands of addresses only own CryptoKitties. Nodes in these graphs are sized by how many they own.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In Gods Unchained, you can see that many addresses own many cards (a deck!). The light gray nodes that connect NFT projects represent clear co- ownership patterns. There are thousands of addresses that own two game’s NFTs, seen on the right side of the overall plot. But there are other smaller regimes of co-ownership — such as between Cryptovoxels and Decentraland, and between ENS and many other projects, indicated by the connections “fanning out” across different projects.</div>
<div id="a1EC" class="heading_s72">Non-Fungible-Token Market Booms As Big Names Join Crypto’s Newest Craze</div>
<div class="class_s6S">For some time now, institutional interest in the crypto world has been building a head of steam. Electric car maker Tesla is the latest blue-chip firm to take the leap, acquiring $1.5 billion of bitcoin in January and outlining plans to accept the asset as payment in the near future. The move followed a conversation between Elon Musk and fellow billionaire Michael Saylor, whose company made its own 10-figure bitcoin purchase in 2020.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Naturally, Tesla’s announcement caused a ripple of excitement to spread through the crypto space, as regular investors prick up their ears. So, what next for the world of provably scarce digital assets and permissionless blockchains?</div>
<div class="class_s75">While many deep-pocketed hedge funds are likely to copy the playbooks of Tesla, Microstrategy, Mass Mutual, and leading digital funds, and accumulate bitcoin, many everyday investors and curious digitalists are looking towards the vast altcoin market (alts) to find the next big thing.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Beyond alts, opportunities also abound in the form of Non-<span id="page_73"></span>
 Fungible Tokens (NFTs), provably scarce digital assets representing a range of commodities such as artwork, gaming collectibles, and even real estate – both in the physical and virtual space.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Opinion Is Divided on NFTs</div>
<div class="class_s75">For their proponents, NFTs represent the future of collectibles and the expanding digital resource economy: a means by which users can prove ownership of goods, be they physical or virtual, via unique digital tokens recorded on blockchain. Detractors, though, have been less than convinced, citing concerns centered on the inability of NFTs to stimulate real-world volume – unlike crypto assets. The weekly volume of the NFT market currently stands at $8.2 million. By comparison, weekly trade volume on bitcoin futures alone surpassed $500 billion during the month of January.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Critics contend that NFTs such as digital paintings are merely bought and held rather than traded, though the eventual maturation of the industry could see thriving markets emerge. After all, cryptocurrency once lacked the necessary infrastructure and liquidity to attract investors like Musk, Saylor, and Paul Tudor Jones.</div>
<div class="class_s75">With the Blockchain and Ethereum protocol cryptocurrencies well established, might the NFT landscape represent blockchain’s logical next frontier? If you can put “money” on a blockchain, in the form of borderless digital assets or collateralized fiat-pegged stablecoins, why can’t you do the same with other goods?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Well, you can – and many are. The million-dollar question is whether NFTs can generate sufficient interest to follow in the slipstream of bitcoin and altcoins and deliver an appreciable return on investment, and as importantly, give the average investor and opportunity to access to fractional investments in <span id="page_74"></span>
 assets that are the domain of wealthy collectors and high-end auction houses.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">In Comes Hollywood</div>
<div class="class_s75">With billionaire Mark Cuban selling NFT’s of his tweets for about $1K a pop and Lindsay Lohan shilling Bitcoin to her twitter followers, it was only a matter of time till the celebrity elite joined the NFT party.</div>
<div class="class_s75">One project hoping to get the “A-listers'' onboard is Ethernity, which is auctioning digital artwork featuring stars from the crypto, sports, and investment worlds, with each piece represented as an NFT. The collection features the blessing of such public figures as Italian soccer legend Paolo Maldini, the Winklevoss twins, and Philadelphia 76ers billionaire Michael Rubin. The latter is the founder of the All in Challenge, a charity drive to support organizations fighting food insecurity that has to date raised over $50 million.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Launched by early bitcoin investor Nick Rose Ntertsas, Ethernity claims it will be a platform where global stars – athletes, artists, celebrities – can lend their image to limited-edition artworks, with proceeds going to the star’s chosen charity. Rose says they’ve already accumulated 75 celebrity-backed artworks that are ready for auction in the coming weeks.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Setting aside the pixie dust of star power for a moment, can intangible goods ever be as desirable as their physical counterparts, particularly where the aesthetics of a painting are concerned?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Another recent success story underscoring the potential of NFTs is Hashmasks, a venture whose gaudy NFTs are part digital portrait, part coveted collectible. The colorful NFTs were alluring enough, in any case, to raise $10 million worth of <span id="page_75"></span>
 ETH in just four days. No two titles are the same, giving collectible names the uniqueness of, say, a Twitter handle.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In January, meanwhile, a single ultra-rare CryptoPunk NFT sold for 605 ETH, around $762,000 at the time. It’s this sort of early interest that nourishes bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano’s belief that the digital art market cap will grow, in time, to become larger than the physical art market cap.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">NFT Use Cases Growing</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s not just art. Last week Jehan Chu, founder of blockchain investment firm Kenetic, forked over $84,000 for 680,000 Handshake (HNS) NFTs, entitling the bearer to issue .NFT web domain extensions via the Handshake blockchain. Chu called NFTs the “true missing link between online and offline objects'' and stated his belief that they could transform business, finance, society and culture. Bold claim is an understatement.</div>
<div class="class_s75">As well as being provably scarce, NFTs benefit from transparency thanks to their recording on a public ledger, adding a layer of protection to collectible assets that people seem to be drawn to. Some have speculated that NFTs could have a pivotal role to play in the decentralized finance (defi) sector, and in fact, there is already a proof of concept for this in the form of Alpaca City’s Ethereum-based virtual world.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Alpaca’s November token pre-sale sold out within 15 minutes, raising close to 1,000 ETH. Owners can not only “breed” Alpaca NFTs (remember CryptoKitties?) but perhaps the game-changer for the NFT market will be enhancing tokens’ utility: NFT-collateralized loans, interest-bearing accounts and so on. Interoperability will also be key, as NFT holders will want to send and receive assets from disparate blockchains.</div>
<div class="class_s75">DeFi primitives currently exist on established blockchains like <span id="page_76"></span>
 Ethereum and TRON. The latter has just released its own NFT standard, TRC-721, enabling users to track and transfer tokens on the high-throughput platform. People on both sides of the equation are seeing the value of NFTs. Buyers are rushing to get skin in the game, while companies are offering secure and accessible NFT protocols.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Smart contract network Ethereum is home to countless NFT projects including Hashmasks, CryptoPunks, and Decentraland, the latter being a digital realm wherein gamers can explore, interact with others, buy plots of virtual land and even create their own revenue-generating enterprises. A blockchain-based iteration of The Sims, in essence. Who knows, if the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt in the real world, more of us could be donning a VR headset and venturing into these worlds to make our (NFT) fortune.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Where Next?</div>
<div class="class_s75">It is extremely difficult to gauge the potential of the NFT market. Much will depend on the evolution and success of the VR/AR gaming market, speculative investor interest, the relative stability of gas prices (particularly on Ethereum), and the possible emergence of dedicated NFT-focused blockchains to power expanding ecosystems.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Critical questions aren’t going away, though: NFTs simply haven’t yet demonstrated their ability to retain value over time. Volume is comparatively low (but growing), and NFTs remain highly illiquid. Buying one is easy. Selling one, however, is dependent upon finding a willing buyer who shares the same aesthetic sensibilities.</div>
<div class="class_s75">When the music stops, no one wants to be left holding an unwanted NFT. For now, though, the party is in full swing. On February 8, another NFT record was smashed when a buyer paid $1.5 million for nine plots of virtual land.</div>
<div id="page_77" class="class_s75">Digital real estate is officially now more expensive than the real thing. It might be madness, but it’s a collective mania shared by an increasing number of crypto-savvy investors.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Capitalism is a social system and digitalists understand the power of the crowd in maximizing the utility of monetizing all things in the cyber world. As everyone in the world becomes connected to the network, it is likely that everything that can be tokenized will be.</div>
<div id="a1EH" class="heading_s72">NFTs: a new disruptor in the art market?</div>
<div class="class_sBY">The Takeaway:</div>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a way to prove ownership of digital art and collectibles.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">The cool image or video the NFT owner owns doesn't actually live on the blockchain. Instead the token refers to a file that sits somewhere else on the web.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">If the file is stored at a traditional web address, the NFT owner is in some danger if that file is ever taken offline.</li>
<li class="class_s6W">The NFT industry has solutions for this issue, but stakeholders haven't settled on best practices yet, making it difficult for buyers to assess which NFTs safely store data for the long term.</li>
</ul>
<div class="class_sDX">Clearly, buyers are very excited about the potential of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</div>
<div class="class_s75">This month alone, Nyan Cat’s creator nabbed almost $600,000 in ETH, a single Hashmask sold for $650,000, rare CryptoPunks are going for over $1 million and a chunk of “land” in the game Axie Infinity fetched 888 ETH.</div>
<div id="page_78" class="class_s75">But those buyers should consider a very important question: What will happen to their NFT when the company or artist that created it closes up shop?</div>
<div class="class_s75">That question may be somewhat ahead of the curve for an industry growing this fast. For one data point, Devin Finzer, CEO of NFT marketplace OpenSea, told CoinDesk in a phone call that the company has “had some pretty insane growth,” going from $1 million in volume as of August to $8 million in January and $50 million already in February.</div>
<div class="class_s75">An NFT is a completely unique blockchain token. This is distinct from other tokens, which are fungible. One of Augur’s REP tokens is as good as any other, but each CryptoKitties collectible is its own cat, and provably so.</div>
<div class="class_s75">As this particular blockchain use-case clicks in the minds of buyers, it’s important that they get more sophisticated about considering how safe and secure their asset is – its persistence.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Persistence is more an issue for those buying art or collectibles than it is for people buying, for example, in-game items (such as weapons or land).</div>
<div class="class_s75">Furthermore, NFTs can do a lot of things besides track content ownership. NFTs can make shipping invoices into loan collateral or manage smart- contract risk.</div>
<div class="class_s75">But the key use-case right now is for owning cool stuff minted online, usually with an image or GIF, but sometimes with sound, video or text attached to a completely unique token on Ethereum or, in the case of the surging NBA Top Shot, on Flow.</div>
<div class="class_s75">So when users buy that cool-digital-thing, whether a sliver of basketball video or brilliant piece of artwork, do they know how the cool-digital-thing is hosted and can they verify it will <span id="page_79"></span>
 continue to exist over time?</div>
<div class="class_s75">“When you talk about blockchain and decentralization that’s not something that’s on consumers’ minds. But LeBron James, they understand that,” David Pakman, a partner at the venture firm Venrock, told CoinDesk in a phone call. If an NFT buyer spends enough on an NFT to make their wallet groan, though, they might want to think about the blockchain bits after all.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">How does this all work?</div>
<div class="class_s75">On the simplest level, an NFT is a record (a document with a hash) stored on Ethereum (usually) that points to where its associated content (the image) lives somewhere else on the internet (it’s much too expensive to store images on Ethereum).</div>
<div class="class_s75">“You can go to the contract and you can actually query the contract for what’s called a TokenURI,” OpenSea’s Finzer told CoinDesk.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The people who made the ERC-721 standard explicitly decided not to weigh in on where a creator puts the data and how reliable that storage site is.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“Who is the authority and who owns what and can we prove that?” William Entriken told CoinDesk. “This is a little bit outside of the scope of the standard.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">Entriken is an open-source promoter who got involved with the crypto community in 2018 to shepherd the ERC-721 standard that makes NFTs on Ethereum possible.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In short, the NFT tells you where the content lives at the time it was minted; the standard isn’t trying to enforce some concept of data persistence. That’s something the industry needs to work out itself.</div>
<div class="class_s75">There are more ways now to point at “where” content is than there was when the ERC-721 standard was finalized, and more <span id="page_80"></span>
 may still be to come. The new web allows content to be addressed by what it is, rather than where it is (which is all the old web can do), and NFTs are a case in point for how this is advantageous.</div>
<div class="class_s75">To explain: On the web as we all know it, addresses point to locations.</div>
<div class="class_s75">There’s a specific website and a specific file on that website where some data sits. There might be millions of copies of Nyan Cat across the internet, but a traditional HTTPS address (like the one at the top of your browser right now) will only point to one file online.</div>
<div class="class_s75">But now we also have content addressing, pioneered by the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Content addressing makes a hash of the content itself and, provided no one messes with the file, can find the nearest copy of that content when a user wants to see it.</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">Interest is growing in Non-Fungible Tokens, which represent digital works and proof of ownership.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In October last year, Christie’s included a work by Robert <span id="page_81"></span>
 Alice in its post-war and contemporary art sale. Although looking rather like a vinyl LP, the circular gold leaf and acrylic on canvas piece, up close, consists of over a quarter of a million digits of code, with 32 gold-encrusted ones hidden among them. The 2019 work, called Block 21 (42.36433° N, -71.26189° E) leapfrogged its $12,000 to $18,000 estimate to sell for $131,250, and was accompanied by a NFT (Non-Fungible Token), a digital version that automatically resets itself to the time zone of the owner’s location. This was the first time a major auction house had sold one of these digital tokens.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Meanwhile, the artist, writer, dealer and art-world gadfly Kenny Schachter has also been producing NFTs, recently offering three digital works on the Nifty platform. One is his take on Donald Trump’s defeat: titled That’s All Folks, it is a digital work based on the end title of a Looney Tunes film. Schachter offered an edition of five for $500 each, all sold, and they have since been traded a number of times; one had received a bid of $1,111 at the time of writing. On each resale Schachter receives a small commission. “All the art I make is digital, in the form of videos or images—now I’m chomping at the bit to sell more works this way,” Schachter says. “I am convinced that the field will mushroom in the coming two or three years.”</div>
<div class="class_sC2">NFTs for dummies</div>
<div class="class_s75">So, what are NFTs? Are they the future of the art market, as some have claimed? Or just another here-today, gone-tomorrow speculative phenomenon?</div>
<div class="class_s75">The “fungible” in Non-Fungible Token describes something that is identical to something else. So one gram of gold or a GlaxoSmithKline share, for example, is the same as any other.</div>
<div class="class_s75">When you buy an NFT, you are buying a token and the work of <span id="page_82"></span>
 art linked to it. The transaction is registered on the blockchain, a decentralised database.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The work can be unique (as in the Alice piece), or in editions (as in the Schachter ones) but each token is unique to that work. The purchase of the NFT, registered on the blockchain, provides a permanent record of that purchase and provides proof of ownership.</div>
<div class="class_s75">You can display it on your computer or TV, print it out, or resell it. While anyone can print out or display an image from the internet, that image does not belong to them and they cannot trade it, so NFTs protect the artist’s authorship and make a secondary market possible.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Payment is generally made in cryptocurrency; no doubt stimulated by the boom in cryptocurrencies, the market for NFTs is growing: in December 2020, nearly $9m worth of NFT-based art was sold, according to the cryptocurrency news website <span class="class_s1AE">Be[in]Crypto</span>
 , more than three times the value of sales the previous month.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">“Balls deep” in cute kittens</div>
<div class="class_s75">Those from a more traditional art background will be horrified by most of the “art” offered as NFTs. Garish, jaggedly drawn faces, cartoonish figures, cute kittens… the images are often derived from video games, comics or fantasy movies. “Like something on the back of a van,” Schachter says, but he notes that NFT “art” is attracting an entirely new audience of buyers.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The artists themselves are hardly traditional—Beeple, for instance, one of the best-selling NFT artists, introduces a “drop” (a flash sale when new works are released) with a statement that starts: “hahahah, ok so we’re going balls deep on this motherfucker...”</div>
<div class="class_s75">Meanwhile, other players in the digital field are getting <span id="page_83"></span>
 interested. Verisart, for instance, which registers art and its provenance and ownership on the blockchain, is providing certificates for NFTs, with the work’s image and details, current owner key, URL, secure QR code and a unique blockchain address. “The growth in the NFT market has been phenomenal and we’re delighted to have verified some of the leading artists in this emerging new art market,” says Verisart’s chief executive and founder Robert Norton.</div>
<div class="class_s75">So, is this just a flash in the pan or a more permanent arrival on the art market? Neither the low value of the market—probably little over $13.6m in total, hardly massive—nor the quality of art offered indicate it will threaten the traditional trade any time soon. But as Norton points out, street art was initially disregarded—and now a Banksy print could set you back over a million.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Self-hosted art</div>
<div class="class_s75">Pinata is a company built on IPFS and Filecoin that has a particularly strong position on storage.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The project argues that when an art buyer buys a painting, the buyer then takes responsibility for care and custody of the painting and it’s out of the artists’ hands. So why, Pinata contends, should we expect digital content creators to manage ownership of NFTs forever?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Pinata’s solution, as articulated in a blog post last April, involves the NFT’s owner putting a copy into an IPFS instance they control. IPFS would be able to find either copy, but if the creator deleted theirs the new owner would still have one, and the hash would verify it was the same digital thing (even though it had moved).</div>
<div class="class_s75">Let’s pause here because Web 3 is weird. To restate the above: There can be one copy or a thousand copies or a <span id="page_84"></span>
 million, but the NFT is like a deed.</div>
<div class="class_s75">However many copies anyone makes there will only be one record that bestows ownership; it will be in just one wallet. That’s the owner of the NFT no matter how many people have a copy.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In fact, artist Sarah Friend argues on the Byzantine Dreams podcast that a digital artwork might become more valuable the more people decide to hold a copy.</div>
<div class="class_s75">End intermission, back to permanent storage options: There is another way a creator could at least try to host content in a way that lives forever. It’s a very new protocol, but Arweave’s whole premise is that creators can pay once and store a file for as long as the Arweave network persists.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“Artists can trivially mint their tokens via an integrated platform like Mintbase, or they can upload using ArDrive (or similar) and drop the Arweave URL into their minting app of choice,” Sam Williams, Arweave CEO, told CoinDesk in an email.</div>
<div class="class_s75">We haven’t hit “forever” yet or even very long, so Arweave might be a bit of a leap of faith. “I remember hearing really good things about Arweave, but IPFS has been around longer,” OpenSea’s Finzer noted.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Either way, Pakman thought it was good to raise another issue that might have some savvy buyers nervous. Could the people who created NFTs ever devalue them by trying to revoke owners rights to the content?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Take NBA Top Shot as an example. “Every time a moment is minted, the NBA can’t come and take away the rights from Dapper Labs,” Pakman said. “You own the IP that’s embedded in that.”</div>
<div id="page_85" class="class_s75">It’s just like baseball cards. The National Basketball Association could no more take back an owner’s video moment than Major League Baseball could go around and steal back everyone’s cardboard baseball cards if it got into a fight with their publisher, the Topps card company, for example.</div>
<div id="a1C4" class="heading_s72">NFTs Are Here. But Where Are They Headed?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">There was something both fresh and familiar about the NFT.NYC conference that non-fungible token developer PeopleBrowsr put on at the PlayStation Theater in Times Square last week.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It felt like some of the early bitcoin conferences: A little scrappy and rough around the edges, some wild ideas that ranged from practical to pie-in-the- sky, but in all exuding a great deal of enthusiasm for a novel blockchain technology that could spawn a variety of new business and philanthropic models.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It remains to be seen whether NFTs can get beyond the gimmick status they occupied in popular imagination since Dapper Labs launched CryptoKitties, the popular game that creates unique, collectible, breedable digital cats.</div>
<div class="class_s75">There are questions about scalability and interoperability associated with ERC-721, the dominant, Ethereum-based NFT standard, and on whether the world will embrace outside-the-box ideas for redefining value, property and commerce.</div>
<div class="class_s75">As with bitcoin’s development, success or failure will depend upon the emergence of an impassioned community and ecosystem around the technology, and the vibe at NFT.NYC suggested this is happening.</div>
<div id="page_86" class="class_s75">What’s both interesting and challenging, though, is that the very notion of community in the NFT world is quite different from the one observed in fungible tokens such as bitcoin. Unlike a bitcoin, which is intended to be fully substitutable for any other bitcoin, a non-fungible token is a unique piece of digital property.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Thus, the community that assigns value to that asset can often be quite narrow.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Speaking with me on stage, Arnold Waldstein, who raised $140,000 for ocean conservation via the Honu project – a collectible CryptoKitty that was part turtle, part cat – noted that Honu became a compelling storytelling device with which to galvanize action among a specific community of people passionate about ocean health.</div>
<div class="class_s75">But at the same time, the structure and community makeup made it difficult to achieve fundraising goals under the initial proposal. The team eventually had to abandon an auction model and went for a one-off sale.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s challenges like that which have people questioning what kind of business model could function for NFTs. Thankfully, some compelling ideas for new models that address them bubbled forth at the event.</div>
<div class="class_s75">regimes of co-ownership — such as between Cryptovoxels and Decentraland, and between ENS and many other projects, indicated by the connections “fanning out” across different projects.</div>
<div id="a1DC" class="heading_s72">Digital Celebrities &amp; Tokens</div>
<div class="class_s6S">What if there were fungible tokens to advance a narrative for digital celebrities? Sending tokens to their token address will <span id="page_87"></span>
 result in a patronage badge in the form of a non-fungible token as well as leaderboard narratives. As digital celebrities start to gain traction, how do designers start to design tokens and digital collectibles to grant access to new content, instead of just being collected?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Maybe digital collectibles from digital celebrities can be designed as a form of payment just like fungible tokens can.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Any token is a currency. Soon, we’ll start seeing users request NFTs for other NFTs instead of ETH, the native NFT store of value. CryptoStrikers already accepts CryptoKitties for packs. Can CryptoKitties become a store of value for other NFTs?</div>

<div id="page_88" class="class_sF3">11 Projects Building a Strong Foundation Beneath the Marriage of DeFi and NFTs</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Digital collectibles on blockchains are driving the retail mania for crypto higher right now, in part because they are cool and in part because the market seems to have finally come to this consensus: Provable ownership of digital items can accrue real value.</div>
<div class="class_s75">When there is real value, there is finance. These collectibles, also known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), have proven lately to have very high values. “NFTs are a foundational building block of the emerging virtual economy,” Stephen Young, the founder and CEO of NFTfi, said in a press release.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The latest data point in the ongoing story of the marriage of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) is the new funding for NFTfi, a project that allows borrowers to post digital items as collateral. NFTfi announced Thursday an $890,000 investment round from backers including CoinFund, 1kx, The LAO and Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou, among others.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTfi is one of several companies making it a lot easier to get money in, earn yield and get it back out of the digital collectible space.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">How it works</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTfi is basically like DeFi giants Compound and Aave, both <span id="page_89"></span>
 money markets, but those two use fungible collateral, like ETH or various stablecoins. NFTs are non-fungible and they are markets with less liquidity in them, making price discovery trickier.</div>
<div class="class_s75">That’s changing fast with more and more products coming onto the market making it easier for liquidity to flow through the many creations. And remember, this is crypto: Changing fast means a wildly different thing in this industry than in the pokey old world of mobile phones and social networks. “As NFTs re-imagined how we produce and define ownership of digital content online, we’ll also, in turn, begin to re-imagine a whole new category of financial services based on these new building blocks,” Lasse Clausen, a partner at the venture firm 1kx, said in a press release.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Beyond NFTfi, here are 10 more projects that are making the NFT market nearly as complex, flexible and liquid as the rest of crypto:</div>
<div class="class_sC2">NIFTEX</div>
<div class="class_s75">The startup, whose platform makes fractional ownership of NFTs possible, is working on a new version with lots of new features. For example, it will be able to allow creators to earn royalties on trades of fractions, governance over the underlying NFTs for holders of a fraction and other tools that allow for more fine-grained ownership. Also, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is coming to govern the whole application. “Fractional ownership of songs, books, other content is a no-brainer. One edition, lots of owners, uniqueness is king,” co-founder Joel Hubert told CoinDesk in an email.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Ark Gallery</div>
<div class="class_s75">This company created a DAO that built wrapped CryptoPunks, <span id="page_90"></span>
 which made Larva Labs’ pioneering NFTs more fungible. Ark has subsequently created additional tools to enhance liquidity for the original non-fungible</div>
<div class="class_s75">token, and probably deserves some credit for today’s white-hot CryptoPunks market. It is currently working on Blank.Art. “We will launch NFT projects that are appropriating financial concepts and themes for artistic purposes,” Ark’s Roberto Ceresia told CoinDesk in an email.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Mintbase</div>
<div class="class_s75">Mintbase is a platform that makes it easy to mint non-fungible tokens. It had an investment round recently led by Sino Global. Obviously it primarily enables users to mint on Ethereum, but the NEAR blockchain has gone out of its way to be compatible with the original smart-contract chain. Right now, Mintbase is launching a feature on NEAR that allows royalties on sales to be shared with up to 1,000 people. “That really is the fractional ownership part everyone is talking about,” COO Carolin Wend told CoinDesk.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">NFTX</div>
<div class="class_s75">This one enables community-owned index funds so that one token represents ownership in many NFTs. It has tokens for specific categories of NFTs and others that represent a spectrum of the market. “There are, however, many people out there that don’t have the time or knowledge to trade individual NFTs but would like exposure to NFT markets. These are the NFTX target users,” the firm wrote in January.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Charged Particles</div>
<div class="class_s75">This protocol aims to enable any NFT to be wrapped or embedded with an ERC-20 token. So just in case there was any doubt an NFT had value, a user could wrap it with interest-earning tokens, such as the Aave tokens, and it would have <span id="page_91"></span>
 value beyond any doubt. This is basically the same as what the forthcoming Aavegotchi game is doing. What will it mean for non-fungible and fungible assets to become roommates? Time will tell.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Zora Protocol</div>
<div class="class_s75">According to its white paper, “Zora provides a cryptographically enforced registry of media independent of any platform.” One of Zora’s creators, Jacob Horne, told CoinDesk in an email, “We’ve directly built the market into the NFT, and we’ve created a net new auction model specific to NFTs. Zora auctions are perpetual, anyone can bid in any currency, the owner can accept any bid.” If that sounds head-scratching, check out this new genre of poetry built with the help of the Zora team.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Unifty</div>
<div class="class_s75">“Unifty is an NFT management system. Think of it as ‘the WordPress of NFTs,'” Markus Medinger of the Unifty team told CoinDesk in an email. Unifty has a marketplace coming with new features around copyright management and value drops, among others. The platform is somewhat unique in that it largely functions off Ethereum. “We already support xDai, BSC [Binance Smart Chain], Polygon [née Matic], Celo and Moonbeam Alpha. Multi-chain support is actually one of our expertise,” Medinger added.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Upshot</div>
<div class="class_s75">This is an as-yet-unreleased project for crowdsourcing NFT appraisals. “The next step for financialization is solving the NFT price discovery problem in a capital efficient way,” CoinFund’s Jake Brukhman told CoinDesk.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">NFT Trader</div>
<div id="page_92" class="class_s75">A peer-to-peer trading project for NFTs, still in beta. Be careful!</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Polyient Games</div>
<div class="class_s75">This group is all over NFT financialization, from investing in the sector to building tools to make it more robust. It runs a decentralized exchange for NFTs, has its own approach to fractional ownership and also has products built for NFT security. The company is teasing a game now that promises to make DeFi more game-like. “Polyient Games is our decentralized ecosystem designed to drive forward NFT innovation, both internally and via third-party participation,” Craig Russo, one of the co-founders, told CoinDesk in an email.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">State of the market</div>
<div class="class_s75">The original DeFi players have not made a lot of noise directly around NFTs yet. Scott Lewis of DeFi Pulse is involved with NFTX and Aave invested in the video game that uses its tokens, Aavegotchi. “Aave community has enormous interest,” Stani Kulechov, CEO of the money market Aave, told CoinDesk in an email.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Normally this is the part of the post where we’d tell readers just learning about NFTs and DeFi that they should take a very small amount of ETH or stablecoins and just buy some little things and play around. None of this stuff really makes sense until a person tries it. Unfortunately, right now, it’s impossible for most people to spend a negligible amount of money in DeFi because transaction fees (“gas,” in Ethereum parlance) make everything expensive.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Layer 2 platforms are those that sit atop Ethereum and other blockchains, taking advantage of the underlying blockchain’s security while also allowing cheaper, faster transactions. <span id="page_93"></span>
 NIFTEX’s Huber told CoinDesk he foresees layer 2 solutions being very important to this sector, but too little liquidity has moved onto any one layer 2 to make it worthwhile for an app like his to move there yet.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“Gas has really made it hard to enjoy the DeFi playground on ETH mainnet,” Marguerite deCourcelle of Blockade Games told CoinDesk. Blockade is in the middle of moving its users to the layer 2 now known as Polygon. “I think we’re about to see a lot more users and developers on L2,” she said.</div>
<div id="a1FY" class="heading_s72">NFTs &amp; DeFi: A good combination?</div>
<div class="class_s6S">If you want to know what non-fungible tokens (NFT) are, why they are becoming increasingly popular in the crypto scene, and what they have to do with decentralized finance (DeFi), we must first explore the concept of “value” in depth.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">What is value?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Value is the innate quality of a thing which makes it desirable to a certain extent. This value can be related to a number of tangible and intangible characteristics, particularly rarity.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The economic value of something therefore depends on its quality and scarcity.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Why is value so important to NFTs?</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic tokens which are not backed by a traditional asset, and instead are representative of something else, such as an artwork, an event, or a digital item. Thus, many people mistakenly jump to the conclusion that NFTs do not have value.</div>
<div class="class_s75">However, non-fungible tokens are indeed valuable. NFTs represent unique assets, and are rare and cryptographically <span id="page_94"></span>
 secure. They are not interchangeable with each other and thus introduce scarcity to the digital world. Each of these tokens acquires value due to this scarcity. This occurs in accordance with the traditional law of supply and demand — parties are willing to pay more for a specific and rare NFT.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTs are thus optimally suited for use by decentralized applications (dApps) to allow for the creation and ownership of unique digital items and collectibles.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTs can be traded at exchanges that connect buyers with sellers. In these exchanges, every NFT is unique, and therefore gets its own price.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">What do NFTs have to do with blockchain?</div>
<div class="class_s75">It all started back in 2016 when Bitcoin-based trading cards were issued as some of the first NFTs. In 2017, these early NFTs were published on the Ethereum blockchain using CryptoPunks, a platform offering NFTs representing artwork. However, the real hype started in December 2017 with the deployment of the blockchain-based game CryptoKitties, which uses NFTs to represent ownership of digital cats on their platform. As of today, more than 131 million USD is bound in these two projects in Ether.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In the years since this initial NFT hype, hundreds of other NFT iterations have become available on the market.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Since the beginnings of using NFTs on the blockchain, various standards have been created to facilitate the issuance of NFTs. The most popular of these is ERC-721, which is a standard for the issuance and trading of non- fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain. A more recent, improved standard is ERC-1155, which enables a single contract to contain both fungible and non-fungible tokens.</div>
<div class="class_s75">This standardization of NFTs allows a higher degree of <span id="page_95"></span>
 interoperability, meaning that unique assets can be transferred between applications with relative ease, ushering in additional use cases.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">What are the possible fields of application?</div>
<div class="class_s75">It is clear that NFTs offer a high level of interoperability and act as representations of non-traditional assets.</div>
<div class="class_s75">This means that NFTs can be used in many areas. This includes video games, digital identity, licensing, certificates, or fine arts. These tokens can and even allow for fractional ownership of objects.</div>
<div class="class_s75">This is precisely where DeFi comes into play.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In all of the fields they are applied to, NFTs serve to represent some sort of value. The administration of these values can be done completely in the blockchain via smart contracts. This perfectly fits the definition of a DeFi project: a financial tool operating along the blockchain.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Present DeFi NFT offerings:</div>
<div class="class_s75">Existing developments in this area are already diverse.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For example, there are DeFi projects that describe themselves as a decentralized exchange for NFTs. One of the best known in this area is Rarible.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Another example for the combination of NFTs and DeFi is Aavegotchi, which is a completely decentralized collection game.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Furthermore, Tinlake combines NFTs and Defi by offering a service that forms a bridge between real-world assets and DeFi. Its goal is accessing bankless liquidity.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTfi is an additional player that stands out in this field. They offer a platform on which owners can lend their NFTs to other <span id="page_96"></span>
 users.</div>
<div class="class_s75">These companies are already innovative and diverse. But, these are just a few of the many potential applications of these technologies. As described, the possibilities for combining DeFi and NFTs are far from exhausted.</div>
<div class="class_s75">A particularly interesting future endeavor would be the use of DeFi and NFTs in in-game worlds, or even for the administration of real assets such as land and houses.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTs describe unique cryptographic tokens which are considered valuable because of their security and scarcity. In combination with decentralized financial products, unique financial services can be created using these tokens.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Potential use cases for this type of technological innovation include investments, liquidity mining, or in-game currencies. There are truly unlimited ideas for combining NFTs and DeFi-it remains to be seen which interesting projects will appear soon.</div>
<div id="a1G6" class="heading_s72">The Nifty Ways That NFTs Become DeFi</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Today DappRadar has an in-depth report on the fast-moving non-fungible tokens space. NFTs are tokens that have unique characteristics and aren’t interchangeable with each other; they’re meant to represent things and not currencies, and as trading volume and prices show, they’re taking off.</div>
<div class="class_s75">DappRadar dives into new token standards gaining adoption beyond ERC721, and new Layer 1s beyond Ethereum that are supporting trading. They also explore how the use of liquidity mining strategies found in DeFi are being used by NFT platforms; how some of these strategies have resulted in low quality art and which have resulted in more genuine <span id="page_97"></span>
 engagement. The report also highlights the different ways that NFTs and DeFi are starting to interact, from NFTs to insure financial assets, to interest-bearing tokens. It’s clear we’re just starting to realize what the full potential of these unique digital assets can be. Read below to see how.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Blockchain technology goes far beyond the digital currency use case. Over the past six months, headlines have been dominated by cryptocurrencies and related projects as they spiked in value. But these assets were fungible meaning that one ETH token is identical to another ETH token. In the shadow of the DeFi canopy blossomed NFTs, and it’s all one thriving forest.</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">NFTs or non-fungible tokens are tokens with a unique property. If you consider popular projects that leverage NFTs: Crypto Punks or CryptoKitties, you will notice that each Crypto Punk and each CryptoKittie is its own unique entity.</div>
<div class="caption_s96">
<div class="class_s6M">
<div id="page_98" class="class_s6J-0"><img src="Image00029.jpg" alt="" class="class_s6J-1" />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">Just like fungible tokens, NFTs have their own standards, the most common being ERC-721 on Ethereum. However, as experimentation and adoption grow, new standards are developing and more blockchains are incorporating. ERC-1155 may be the next most popular standard for NFT projects. Its main advantages are that it is a multi-token standard (projects can mint booth fungible and non-fungible tokens), smart contracts can be reused for multiple issuances, and it supports batch transfers.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Outside of Ethereum, WAX has been making progress utilizing the technology, as has Flow. A number of other ecosystems have also been experimenting with NFTs.</div>

<div class="class_s98">The number of use cases for NFTs is growing and given the nascent state of the technology we are likely to see many more <span id="page_100"></span>
 in the coming future. The key ones so far are art, collectibles and in-game items, virtual worlds, tokenized real-world items, permissions gateways.</div>

<div class="class_s98">The sector is growing and looks to be primed to integrate with the DeFi space. As that occurs we may see a number of new asset classes enter the decentralized financial sector.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Minting and Trading</div>
<div class="class_s75">While there are many interesting use cases developing around NFTs, the ones gathering the most hype right now are in gaming, collectibles, and art. The dynamics in these ecosystems revolve around minting and trading entities.</div>
<div class="caption_sP0">
<div class="class_s6M">

<div class="caption_s10S">
<div class="class_sF3">Image Source: DappRadar</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">In games and collectibles, the minting of NFTs is defined by the publisher or the development team. The team also defines the distribution of the items.</div>
<div class="class_s75">These can be “claimed” as in the case of Crypto Punks, purchased at an auction, discovered in packs or crates, and so on. There is often an element of randomness involved.</div>
<div class="caption_sP0">

<div class="caption_s10S">
<div class="class_sF3">Image Source: DappRadar NFT marketplaces TOP 5 dapps</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">However, the value of these items is determined by the market, and as such, it is critical for users to be able to buy and sell them. This has given rise to NFT marketplaces. These are in a lot of ways similar to Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) in that they enable users to transact with their token assets.</div>
<div class="caption_sP0">

<div class="class_sF3">Image Source: CryptoDiffer visualization based on nonfungible.com data</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">Two major types of marketplaces can be identified: native and aggregator. Native marketplaces are set up by the publisher or the project community for the purposes of transacting the items of a specific dapp and/or ecosystem.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For instance, Crypto Punks have their own marketplace as does Axie Infinity. For some projects, native marketplaces may serve as the primary source of trading activity.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Alternatively aggregate marketplaces, like OpenSea and Rarible offer collectors and artists the ability to buy and sell their NFT tokens from different dapp origins under the same roof. NFT assets are relatively illiquid, so it is not surprising that volumes on NFT marketplaces are much lower than on DEXs.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The gaming space took a big hit this year because of high gas fees on Ethereum, so it is also not unexpected that the AUW numbers are considerably lower. As the sector grows the <span id="page_104"></span>
 number of NFT originators and exchanges should increase, as should the activity figures.</div>

<div id="page_105">The future of NFTs and recent developments</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s6S">The NFT space grew steadily in 2020, with a January 2021 report from DappRadar revealing that daily activity across blockchain games grew 35% during 2020 to around 28,000 daily active unique wallets. In February 2020, NFT marketplace Rarible locked in $1.75 million in seed funding from prominent industry names, including Coinbase Ventures.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Meanwhile, NFTs began to trade hands for eye-watering sums. Teen artist FEWOCiOUS sold NFT artwork for tens of thousands of dollars; a Sorare trading card representing soccer player Kylian Mbappé sold for nearly $65,000; a Nifty Gateway auction of digital artist Beeple's work saw one bidder pay $777,777 for a collection of pieces at the last second; a 24x24 pixel image sold for $176,000. NFT mania hit new heights in February 2020, when an Ethereum project called Hashmasks saw 16,000 pieces of NFT art sell for $9 million.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Big money was accompanied by ever-bigger names, as artists and celebrities seized the opportunity to cash in. Rapper Lil Yachty; Rick &amp; Morty creator Justin Roiland; DJ deadmau5; and YouTuber Logan Paul were among those who launched NFTs.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For the time being, much of the attention around non-fungible <span id="page_106"></span>
 tokens is focused on artwork, gaming and crypto collectibles. Increasingly, recognizable brands are licensing their content for NFTs; fantasy soccer game Sorare has signed up 100 football clubs to its platform, while the likes of the Smurfs, Minecraft and the BBC's Doctor Who have all been rendered as NFTs.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For gaming, non-fungible tokens could be used to represent in-game items like skins, potentially allowing them to be ported to new games or traded with other players.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Their potential however is much wider with possible application to copyright and intellectual property rights, ticketing, and the sale and trading of video games.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Non-fungible tokens add potential to the creation of security tokens, the tokenization of both digital and real-world assets. Physical assets like property could be tokenized for fractional, or shared, ownership. If these security tokens are non-fungible the assets ownership is completely traceable and clear, even if only tokens representing part ownership are sold.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Further application of non-fungible tokens could be certification such as for qualifications, software licensing, warranties, and even birth and death certificates. The smart contract of a non-fungible token immutably proves the identity of the recipient or owner and could be stored in a digital wallet for ease of access and representation. One day, our digital wallets could contain proof of every certificate, license, and asset, we own.</div>
<div id="a1EG" class="heading_s72">Non-Fungible Token Market Grew by 299% in 2020</div>
<div class="class_s6S">
<span class="class_s1AE">The non-fungible token (NFT) market tripled in 2020, with the total value of transactions increasing by 299% year on year to more than $250m, according to a new study released by</span>
 <span class="class_s1AX">NonFungible.com</span>
 <span class="class_s1AE">, an <span id="page_107"></span>
 NFT market analyst firm. Developed with support from foresight business</span>
 <span class="class_s1AX">L’Atelier BNP Paribas,</span>
 <span class="class_s1AE">the report – the third annual study of the NFT market – finds that NFTs are primed to become a leading emerging asset class for the Virtual Economy in the years ahead, both in terms of their financial value and their practical uses, and a major driver of economic activity in virtual worlds.</span>
</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFTs are digital blockchain-linked assets that, unlike Cryptocurrencies, are completely unique and not interchangeable with any other asset. Examples range from plots of virtual land in multi-user platforms, to programmable art, to ownership records for physical assets. Because they are unique and impossible to replicate, they can bridge the gap between the virtual and the physical economies, offering a huge market of valuable digital goods that can be scaled, collected, and traded.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The report, which uses proprietary technology to track activity in the NFT market, found that the total value of all NFT transactions (which includes sales and all other transactions such as “breeding”, “minting” and renting) increased from to $62,862,687 in 2019 to $250,846,205 in 2020. In addition, NonFungible.com also found that market activity has increased significantly: the total number of active wallets transacting NFTs (including buying, selling, holding or using them in a blockchain application) skyrocketed, growing 97%, from 112,731 in 2019 to 222,179 in 2020. Similarly, the number of buyers and sellers rose from 44,644 to 74,529 (+66%), and 25,264 to 31,504 (+24%), respectively. The number of active wallets accelerated throughout 2020, suggesting even stronger growth ahead in 2021: Q4’s total growth was twice Q3’s, and three times that of Q2.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NFT traders have also experienced unprecedented financial performance, with profits of up to $500,000 in a single year and certain traders able to generate annual profits in excess of <span id="page_108"></span>
 $100,000 from trading NFTs.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Meanwhile, big name brands are increasingly entering the space, creating lucrative NFT-based consumer goods and services. These include fashion and luxury brands like Nike, Louis Vuitton and Breitling creating virtual fashion products; sports brands like Turner Sports, NBA, F1 and PSG, as well as entertainment brands like BBC, Warner Music, and Paramount creating online collectables and games; video game studios like Ubisoft and Atari creating virtual worlds, games and tokens; and tech companies like IBM, AMD and Samsung creating new services and utilities.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“As the boundaries between virtual and physical worlds become ever more blurred, we are seeing the rapid growth of virtual economies online, each offering a diversity of employment, investment and commercial opportunities,” said Nadya Ivanova, COO and &amp; foresight lead at L’Atelier BNP Paribas. “For all the hype around cryptocurrencies, it is non-fungible tokens that are driving and enabling much of the economic activity and use cases within virtual platforms, and they are likely to become both an important asset class and a foundation for the virtual economy in the next decade. Investors and brands that want to capitalise on the shift to virtual activity should start by paying close attention to the NFT market as it continues to mature and grow.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">The growth of the NFT market is partly the result of the increase in online activity following the pandemic, but also reflects a wider and accelerating trend towards people spending more of their time – and money – in virtual spaces on virtual goods, services and experiences.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“The exponential growth of the NFT market in 2020 has been remarkable, and historic,” said Dan Kelly, CEO and co-founder of NonFungible.com. “The ecosystem is no longer just a <span id="page_109"></span>
 speculative industry; it’s a value creation industry, reaching newfound maturity, utility and growth. We’re still in the early days of a young and developing space with many new ideas and projects formulating, a testament to the loyal and tight-knit groups who have evolved around the NFT ecosystem. But these are laying the foundations of a future mainstream economy that will change the very way we relate to our online worlds.”</div>

<div class="class_s98">It’s no secret that people like collecting things. The types of items you collect depend on your particular interests and passions or whether those collectibles resonate with you on an emotional level. Think of how you might have collected Pokémon cards, stamps, video games, books, posters, maybe even marbles or bugs as a child. Your collection may look pretty different as an adult. Perhaps you now collect <span id="page_110"></span>
 fashionable bags and shoes, tech gadgets, antiques or artwork. Or maybe you still collect the same things you did as a child.</div>
<div class="class_s75">But what if <span class="class_s1A6">your physical collection can be expanded to a digital and virtual world?</span>
 What if UFC fans can collect and own their favorite Conor McGregor (or other fighter) moments? For Nike fans, how about traversing virtual gaming worlds while donning your favorite kicks? What if you can now own that pet dragon you’ve always secretly wanted in a virtual home? For the art collectors out there, imagine having a virtual gallery of digital artwork that you can fit in your pocket and take around with you to show your friends and family. How about owning your favorite celebrity’s memorabilia and behind the scenes rarities? Well, you might not need to imagine for much longer because the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the crypto world are going to make your wildest imaginings and dreams real — virtually real. And here’s a heads-up to Star Trek fans, you may soon be able to own William Shatner’s tokenized memories in the form of trading cards, one of which will be a poignant image of Shatner hugging longtime friend Leonard Nimoy.</div>

<div class="class_s98">NFTs are not a new concept and the first NFT-like token was the introduction of Bitcoin 2.X (aka colored coins) in 2012. In terms of market capitalization, <span class="class_s1A6">the NFT industry grew 17% in <span id="page_112"></span>
 2019 and was forecasted to grow 50% by the end of 2020.</span>
 This market capitalization is fascinating as it represents the creation of more than $200 million in gross value from nothing in less than two years. According to NFT data resource NonFungible.com, NFT sales activity has increased dramatically since September 2020 and has remained higher than previous months of the year. NFT sales came close to $1 million in the first week of September 2020 as the blockchain-based fantasy soccer card game Sorare reached over $221,000 in sales. This momentum shows no sign of slowing down as $2 million worth of NFTs were exchanged in the first week of December 2020. According to CoinGecko, <span class="class_s1A6">the NFT market capitalization has exceeded its 2020 forecast and reached over $550 million.</span>

<span class="class_s1A6">One of the first NFT projects that really exploded and gained a lot of attention was the CryptoKitties boom in November 2017.</span>
 CryptoKitties is a game built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to collect, breed and exchange virtual cats. The game is known for slowing down the Ethereum network <span id="page_113"></span>
 back in 2017 due to the high amount of activity it stirred up and exemplifies a blockchain use case geared towards entertainment and recreation rather than currencies. These virtual cats are apparently appealing enough to move millions of dollars and the rarer cats are valued at hundreds of dollars each.</div>

<span class="class_s1AE">“</span>
 When we created CryptoKitties, what we were trying to do was test whether we could get people who’ve never used a <span id="page_114"></span>
 blockchain before to use it… and understand why it’s different and why it’s valuable.<span class="class_s1AE">”</span>
</div>
<div class="class_s75">They well and truly succeeded since CryptoKitties taught new users about blockchain and introduced the concept of NFTs to hundreds of thousands of people.</div>
<div class="class_s75">After the CryptoKitties boom at the end of 2017, the NFT marketplace remained rather stagnant throughout 2018 and 2019. NonFungible’s annual report pegged <span class="class_s1A6">2019 as the year of stabilization for the NFT ecosystem as it entered a “</span>
 <span class="class_s1AX">phase of consolidation and stabilization</span>
 <span class="class_s1A6">” following the ICO frenzy.</span>
 The report identifies how most NFT projects had a poor retention rate in the past two years, where the vast majority in 2019 were used for three months or less. It goes on to reveal that only a little over 10% of newly created NFT assets circulated throughout the year, a rate similar to 2018.</div>

</div>
<div class="class_s98">Despite the slowdown after the initial 2017 excitement, new <span id="page_115"></span>
 developments continuously emerge in the NFT space and several activities and projects have garnered attention in recent months especially. Projects have reached record-breaking sales, such as the recent Bitcoin-code-inspired artwork that sold for over $130,000 or the blockchain-based trading card of Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappé that sold for $66,850. Although the CryptoKitty Dragon still holds the record of the priciest non-fungible token ever sold, two of the most expensive NFTs sold in 2019 include the one-of-a-kind digital sports car F1 Delta Time Apex Race Car “1–1–1” (415.9 ETH, $113,124) and a plot of land named The Secret of Satoshi’s Tea Garden in the virtual reality platform Decentraland (1.3M MANA, $80,663). Even celebrities have started engaging with NFTs, like when Paris Hilton auctioned off a cryptograph drawing of her pet cat Munchkin for 40 ETH (worth $17,000 at the time) in August to raise money for charities.</div>
<div class="class_s75">With all the noise NFTs have been making, major companies and big brands have taken an interest and gotten involved in the industry. Several of the biggest brands on the planet are now developing blockchain based games, collectibles and virtual worlds. These include National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Formula 1, Louis Vuitton, Samsung and Nike to name a few. The involvement of these big brands is a major move towards mainstream adoption of NFTs as new users are introduced to the concept of NFTs through channels that they’re passionate about and already familiar with.</div>

</ol>
<div id="a1GA" class="heading_s72">Crypto collectibles are selling for thousands — and celebrities like Mark Cuban are cashing in</div>
<div class="class_s6S">The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with talk of digital collectibles, unique virtual tokens that can represent anything from art to sports memorabilia.</div>
<div class="class_s75">People have been paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for these NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. One investor, Sheldon Corey from Montreal, Canada, told CNBC he paid $20,000 for one of thousands of computer-generated avatars called CryptoPunks.</div>
<div class="class_s75">CryptoPunks isn’t a new phenomenon — it was released by developers Larva Labs in 2017. But it’s boomed in popularity lately, generating $45.2 million in sales volume in the last seven days alone according to the website NonFungible, and inspiring a broader “crypto art” movement.</div>
<div class="class_s75">CryptoKitties, one of the original NFTs, generated $433,454 in <span id="page_119"></span>
 sales in the past week, according to NonFungible. The digital cats, which were developed by a start-up called Dapper Labs, were once so popular they clogged up the network of digital currency ether.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NBA Top Shot, a platform created by Dapper Labs in partnership with the basketball league, attracted $147.8 million in sales in the last seven days, according to NFT data tracker CryptoSlam. The service lets users buy and sell short clips showing match highlights from top basketball players.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Even Mark Cuban and other celebrities are cashing in on the NFT craze. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner has auctioned digital goods online and owns some himself.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The increased momentum for these tokens comes as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have rallied significantly in recent months, and at a time when people are spending more of their time indoors due to coronavirus restrictions.</div>
<div class="class_sC2">Crypto mania</div>
<div class="class_s75">An NBA Top Shot video highlight featuring LeBron James recently sold for a record $208,000. But sales can be volatile — NBA Top Shot and CryptoPunks trades have dropped in the last 24 hours, according to NFT data tracker CryptoSlam.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The surge in prices of these virtual items has led to fears of a repeat of speculative crypto mania. It’s reminded some investors of the initial coin offering, or ICO, bubble in 2017, when multiple start-ups issued new digital tokens to raise money. Barely any of the ICO projects exist today, and some even defrauded investors out of millions of dollars.</div>
<div class="class_s75">There are some parallels with the ICO frenzy — for example, celebrities like Lindsay Lohan and Mark Cuban have recently sold NFTs.</div>
<div id="page_120" class="class_s75">“We had a very similar moment in 2017,” Billy Rennekamp, lead developer at blockchain software firm Cosmos, told CNBC. “Every gallery was considering an NFT. Every blue chip artist was considering it. But there was just too much risk when the market dropped and it was embarrassing to be involved in NFTs when the prices dropped.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">“I wouldn’t be surprised if we go through another entire bull market and bear market,” Rennekamp added.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Still, the firms behind these tokens don’t think it’s a fad.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“NFTs are here to stay,” Caty Tedman, head of partnerships at Dapper Labs, who spearheaded the NBA Top Shot project, told CNBC.</div>
<div class="class_s75">NBA Top Shot now has over 100,000 active collectors and has made $215 million in sales to date, Tedman said. It’s working on a digital collectibles game based on the UFC mixed martial arts league and has also attracted the backing of Warner Music to develop NFTs for music fans.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“The billions spent on Fortnite skins point to the importance of our online lives and personas, and how valuable they are to people,” Matt Hall, co-founder of Larva Labs, told CNBC.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“What NFTs offer are a formalization of digital ownership, and a way for that ownership to be permanent beyond the life of any one company, game or platform.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">Hall said that Larva Labs doesn’t take any fees from users of its marketplace — though they pay blockchain processing fees. “We are CryptoPunks owners just like everyone else,” he added. “So, as the overall market rises, those that we own get more valuable as well.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">The cheapest “punk” available on CryptoPunks is currently worth $36,000, Hall said. Larva is working on a successor to <span id="page_121"></span>
 CryptoPunks, Hall added, without elaborating on the company’s plans.</div>
<div id="a1E0" class="heading_s72">Cashing on future upside</div>
<div class="class_s6S">One key idea is that by attaching a smart contract that enshrines rights for the primary issuer of a token to future income from secondary market sales, creators of digital assets can be encouraged to relinquish control of them.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Venture capitalist David Pakman argued that the idea could lead NFT-embracing gaming companies to dramatically change their approach to how they make money. Such companies could deliberately create a limited supply of a particular digital artifact and ensure that they extract upside from future sales.</div>
<div class="class_s75">This way, rather than locking gamers into a walled garden of value capture, they can let their assets escape into the wider world, where they can generate greater value for the brand.</div>
<div class="class_s75">There was much talk of artists doing the same with otherwise unique, one-off works of art. As of now, an artist might sell a painting to a buyer for $10,000 but gain no benefit when a collector or a gallery subsequently buys it from that first buyer for, say, $1 million. If the work were indelibly associated with a unique NFT and a smart contract to manage future transaction rights, there could be a way for the original artist to participate in that future appreciation.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The approach could also enable payments for derivative works by creatives working with others’ original music or other artistic content. Or it could help charitable efforts like the Honu project, because the resale of the crypto-turtle-kitty to future buyers could continue to kick back funds to philanthropic cause it represents.</div>
<div id="page_122" class="class_s75">It’s these kinds of ideas that make the NFT conversation so engaging, enabling a break with pre-existing mental models so that innovators can conceive of creative new approaches to problems.</div>
<div class="class_s75">For now, much of it is highly intangible, though it was good to see NFT.NYC exhibitors such as Vault.io, which demonstrated the potential for redeemable NFTs to transform gift tokens, branding and commercial exchange by showing visitors how to redeem a token in their wallet for a cup of coffee delivered by a Raspberry Pi-enabled coffee machine.</div>
<div id="a1AS" class="heading_s72">The tension between community and economy</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Still, the question remains whether the narrow community of interests attached to specific NFTs can generate enough liquidity to make them viable.</div>
<div class="class_s75">This will depend in part on the success of different blockchain community’s scaling initiatives and on interoperability solutions such as the Cosmos and Polkadot networks, which could enable NFTs to move across blockchains. If the entire world is to be “tokenized” with these unique digital markers, as some suggest will be the case, we have to get far beyond the clunky on-chain transaction-processing capabilities of Ethereum and its competitors.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s a vision worth fighting for because communities are the breeding grounds for all notions of value. If you can tap into them, you can drive adoption. To achieve that, developers must consider that each community is unique: the things they value, the contracts their members enter into, and their preference for how to govern themselves aren’t necessarily served by anchoring themselves into monolithic blockchains with rigid programming logic.</div>
<div id="page_123" class="class_s75">It’s why, in addition to NFTs, other projects are working on community-based digital asset issuance models that don’t depend on an underlying chain or virtual machine such as Ethereum to process all transactions.</div>
<div class="class_s75">These include Intercoin, perhaps best known for now by a prominent hand-painted mural that greets motorists on the Gowanus Expressway heading into Manhattan from Brooklyn, and the colorfully named Economic Space Agency that was set up in Oakland, California by a group of radical economists, technologists and other social scientists.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The common idea in these concepts is that the smart contract-features, the terms attached the token, and the consensus model can be designed uniquely according to each community’s preferences. Whether they can be secure from attack and sufficiently liquid is the question.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In all of this, there is tension between the narrow, subjectivities of a distinct community’s expressions of value and the requirement to interface that otherwise closed subset of interests with a more universally accepted expression of value in the wider economy – in other words with fungible, negotiable instruments such as bitcoin or dollars.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s in confronting those tensions and figuring out the best business models to overcome them that NFTs and their ilk have the best chance of enabling practical, real implementations that can have a marked impact on the world.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The more that those who are working on them come together and explore the prospects, the greater the chance of success.</div>
<div id="a1CX" class="heading_s72">Problems with NFTs</div>
<div class="class_s6S">Despite bringing sweeping changes to various industries, non-<span id="page_124"></span>
 fungible tokens aren't without their shortcomings. Unfortunately, their problems come from the very same rock they sit on: blockchain.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Decentralized networks are not 100% user-friendly; a hurdle developers are working hard to overcome. For instance, verifying authenticity, selling, purchasing and storing an NFT needs at least a basic understanding of blockchain technology.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The problem sets in when the majority of the targeted individuals are only interested in the product, not the underlying technology, which is true for NFTs relative to other crypto subsectors.</div>
<div class="class_s75">
<span class="class_s1A6">Beeple</span>
 , an NFT creator who sold some of their works for a cool $66,666 (as well as that record-breaking over $777,777,777 purchase), observes that massive adoption of NFTs will only happen if "the necessary infrastructure is in place," which would enable a seamless experience for users.</div>
<div class="class_s75">In other words, we need blockchain to be as mainstream as a “smartphone” or the “internet.” Most people don’t know how those two work technically, yet billions use them every day. We need the same level of sophistication in blockchain for NFT’ to truly capture the world.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The obvious drawback is that, unlike a one-of-a-kind painting or a sculpture, ownership of a digital artwork does not stop anyone else from also ‘owning’ it. You can download the content from Grimes’ Twitter page and ‘own’ it, in that you have a copy that you can distribute.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“I don’t find NFTs enticing as a platform for releasing art on,” v buckenham, a London-based digital artist, told The Guardian.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“The point of owning a piece of art is to look at it and enjoy it – and buying an NFT doesn’t do anything to help you do that. An NFT is just an entry in a fancy database somewhere <span id="page_125"></span>
 asserting that you ‘own’ the artwork. The only thing it’s good for is allowing you to sell on that database entry to someone else later on.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">“The Crypto infrastructure relies mostly on fossil fuels (64 per cent of the world’s electricity: coal 38 per cent, oil and gas 26 per cent). The CO2 emissions, combined with a steady growth of consumption is pushing us towards a climate apocalypse”, French artist Joanie Lemercier points out in a blog post explaining the reasons they cancelled their crypto-art release.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Defenders will say that a lot of bitcoin’s energy use comes from renewable energy, as well as the fact that bitcoin is finite and cannot be mined forever, but the final bitcoin is unlikely to be mined until around the year 2140.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The race is therefore set between whether the bitcoin network can adapt to environmental concerns before the consequences of climate change – malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress – fully become reality.</div>
<div id="a1AK" class="heading_sTE">What next? Oh yes, turning a luxury car into a non-fungible token</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="class_s98">We’ve seen more than one project use the immutability of blockchain to verify important physical things. So, for instance, a pioneer in the space, Verisart, has brought blockchain certification of high art to leading galleries worldwide, and other players are now entering this growing market. Codex Protocol is a new startup also putting art on the blockchain. The benefits are obvious: reducing to near-zero the possibility that an artwork could be fake. This is an incredibly powerful idea, especially at the high end of the commercial spectrum.</div>
<div class="class_s75">A relatively new idea is to take blockchain to the car market. Automakers are already starting to take an interest. BMW, Ford, Renault and General Motors recently joined a new working group of more than 30 auto companies to employ blockchain technology. The Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative aims to speed up the adoption of blockchain, with use cases ranging from autonomous payments to ridesharing. But that’s <span id="page_127"></span>
 not where blockchain adoption for cars ends.</div>
<div class="class_s75">There remains the need for trustworthy assurances of authenticity and condition, especially when it comes to high-end cars. And that’s doubly true of classic and exotic vehicles. Collectible, classic cars can have their documentation forged or misassigned as there’s no one, single, global document standardization for these kinds of cars.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Now a startup hopes to bring their newly launched platform for tokenization to this market.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Proxeus is a blockchain startup that has launched a user-friendly method to register classic car collections on the blockchain, making it both unforgeable and verifiable by anyone. The first client is Mercuria Helvetica in Switzerland.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Proxeus’s process verifies the certificates of authenticity and conditions of the vehicles. As an additional step, the car itself could actually be taken to the blockchain as a non-fungible token with an integrated certification library, offering not only proof of ownership and history but also to serve as a permanent link to the verified documentation.</div>
<div class="class_s75">It’s now launching the beta version of its engine, which has a drag and drop interface.</div>
<div class="class_s75">But do we really want to tokenize luxury cars? Proxeus says that’s not the point. They say their technology means someone without specialized programming skills can have the ability to deploy blockchain for a wide variety of use cases.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Antoine Verdon, co-founder, says: “For the first time we are able to show that our technology is real.” Artan Veliju, CTO, says the platform has the “ability to easily build the workflows needed to use blockchain productively without needing to launch a software development project.”</div>
<div id="page_128" class="class_s75">Their idea is to allow anyone to legally incorporate businesses, register assets and validate certificates on their testnet blockchain. It’s so far been used by the University of Basel’s Center for Innovative Finance course certificates or WWF Switzerland’s tax donation verification system. Test XES tokens will be provided to show how they function within the Proxeus ecosystem and are used to pay for Proxeus’ services.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Shortly after raising $25 million as a part of their ICO, Proxeus now plans to complete the functions described in its whitepaper and release a fully developed solution for enterprise.</div>
<div class="class_s75">Meantime, I’m going to make a, perhaps obvious, observation: The tokenization craze is clearly not going to end here.</div>
<div id="a1FF" class="heading_sFF">RubiX Announces Full-Scale NFT Launchpad on Proprietary Industrial Scale Blockchain</div>
<div class="class_s14B">BaaS company providing full range of NFT solutions built on the highly-secured RubiX blockchain that’s several times stronger in encryption than Bitcoin and Ethereum</div>
<div class="class_sDX">LEWES, Del., March 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <span class="class_s1A6">RubiX</span>
 , a full-scale Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and security solutions company, announces the launch of its Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) application built on the highly-scalable RubiX blockchain backed by proprietary QR Code technology that secures, authenticates and proves ownership of digital and tangible assets.</div>
<div class="class_s75">“There’s no hotter commodity in crypto right now than NFT as the market is growing exponentially by the day. In 2020, NFT trading was worth over $250M, an increase of almost 300 <span id="page_129"></span>
 percent from 2019,” says Chakradhar Kommera, Chief Technology Officer at RubiX. “We are aiming to make NFT more accessible to our enterprise partners and general consumers. The RubiX application is upending the NFT landscape with a unique irreplaceable solution that’s built on the RubiX blockchain as compared to most that are built on the Ethereum blockchain, which is susceptible to security risks and problems like theft of loss of withdrawal keys.”</div>
<div class="class_s75">Advantages of RubiX blockchain include:</div>
<ul class="class_s70-0">
<li class="class_s6W">Intelligent and minimal nodes for PoW based consensus</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Highly-scalable and several times stronger than Bitcoin and Ethereum</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Speed - each transaction is completed within ~250ms. Every node can process four transactions per second and the number of nodes is not capped</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Proprietary QR Code technology that eliminates the risk of duplication of NFTs across platforms</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Decentralized Identity (DID) token which is split non-linearly into private &amp; public shares</li>
<li class="class_s6W">NFTs can be launched &amp; managed with minimal smart contract code</li>
<li class="class_s6W">Ability to split &amp; store private keys to not only enhance security, but also offer strong recovery mechanism</li>
</ul>
<div class="class_sDX">The acceleration of NFT has been fueled by the need to curb fraud and forgery in art work but is now quickly being adopted by other industries that can benefit from a non-cloneable digital certificate of authenticity. RubiX NFT is a digital asset that can be used to prove ownership of virtual and tangible goods containing distinguishing information that is easily verifiable, making it impossible to replicate. The most popular application for NFT today remains digital art, but the RubiX NFT can also be applied to industries including sports <span id="page_130"></span>
 merchandise and memorabilia, luxury goods, real estate and financial institutions like asset management, insurance, payments and fintech.</div>
<div class="class_s75">RubiX Group is a global security company established in 2012 that has recently migrated all of its solutions to its own open source blockchain. In addition to NFT applications, the company is providing a suite of security solutions, Passwordless Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and blockchain solutions on RubiX patented technologies. Partners include the Sojitz Corporation, Internet Initiative Japan (IIJ), Wipro, Fingerprints, Microsoft, Axis Bank, Cognizant, First Abu Dhabi National Bank, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), HCL Technologies and 20 more leading global corporations with over 40 additional clients in pipeline.</div>
<div class="class_s75">The company is planning to launch its RubiX (RBX) public chain in Q2 2021 which will be the native protocol tokens for the RubiX blockchain and available for purchase for both the enterprise and individuals looking to invest in Protocol Tokens.</div>

<div class="class_sC2">About RubiX</div>
<div class="class_s75">RubiX is a proofchain protocol that can scale with asynchronous parallelism to facilitate real world decentralized applications. Cryptographically strong, light weight challenge-response algorithms are used for transaction validation. RubiX uses lightweight Proof of Work satisfying PBFT rule for consensus allowing full nodes to be run across all platforms (Server, NAS, VMs, PCs, Embedded Platforms, IoT's and Mobiles). The platform leverages real world Distributed File System(DFS) based on content-based addressing for data storage.</div>
<div id="page_131" class="class_s75">RubiX has primarily two types of tokens: Utility tokens generated with strong mathematical proofs that are mined by nodes working to secure the network by storing proofs (capped under 50.7 million), and Asset tokens that can represent any underlying asset or contract including NFTs. RubiX chain is an aggregation of several account-chains existing in parallel. Transactions achieve consensus individually, allowing for asynchronous parallelism leading to very high scalability. Account-chains are linked through unique tokens &amp; tokenchain hashes.</div>
<div id="a1AJ" class="heading_s72">Novelties in the NFT sphere</div>
<div class="class_s6S">What can we expect from NFTs in the future? A new revolution is coming thanks to augmented reality and a project called OVR.</div>
<div class="class_s75">According to IDC data, the AR sector will reach $137 billion in 2024.</div>
