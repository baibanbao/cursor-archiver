- 《自上而下》
- 这本书是给什么人看的？
- 尽管按照本书作者的初衷，这本书的目标人权为组织的领导者，包括董事长、理事长、会长、执行主管、首席执行官或者其他管理人员，但是我在翻译中发现，这本书对于普通志愿者也有帮助。
- 书名怎么翻译
- 提到要对志愿者做肺结核检查，在我们看来似乎不能理解，查了美国一些志愿者组织的官方网站，才发现，原来根据美国一些州的法律，只有六个月之内没有得过肺结核的人，才有做志愿者的资格。这跟咱们国内
- 外国读者怎么评价
- 名词怎么统一
- board现在有董事会理事会委员会三种译法
- 最后统一一种，并在第一次出现的地方，加译者注
- 现在的翻译是：
- ２０１０年时，美国国税局许可的纳税减免标准是：用于慈善事业的行驶里程税为每英里0.14美元（同时期用于商务活动的行驶里程税为每英里0.55美元）。从１９９７年美国《纳税人减税法》通过时的每英里0.12美元提高到这个标准后一直没有变过。
- 不合常理。
- 美国税务局的答复
- FAQ #1 – I donate time or services. How much can I deduct?
- You can not deduct the value of your time or services donated to a charity. Volunteers are often surprised about this. Of course, since the volunteer wasn’t paid for the services, they didn’t receive taxable income. No taxable income, no tax deduction – a simple, clean result.
- Yes, 14 cents per mile is silly
- Undoubtedly you’ve seen the regular updates from the IRS and other sources concerning deducting costs of use of a car. The Internal Revenue Code requires the IRS to adjust the business and medical mileage rates based on changes in costs of operating a vehicle. Beginning January 1, 2013, for example, you can deduct 56.5 cents per mile for business miles driven and 24 cents per mile driven for medical or moving purposes. The IRS based the standard mileage rate for business on an annual study of the fixed and variable costs of operating an automobile. The rate for medical and moving purposes is based on the variable costs as determined by the same study. The 14 cents is written right in the Internal Revenue Code (without language suggesting it be adjusted for inflation). See IRC Section 170(i) — which is part of the charitable deduction section of the Code. It hasn’t been changed in years. To get it changed, Congress will have to amend it — time to talk with your Congressperson.

- I got this as a kindle ebook. Awesome! Some great information for DVS's and VP's that supervise them. There is a workbook that parallels this book well that will help you work through the ideas and put them into practice. I got it at a conference. I would recommend that you purchase both - if you are interested in establishing a GREAT volunteer program in your area of expertise.
- Of course, any book by Susan is superb! Happy reading.
