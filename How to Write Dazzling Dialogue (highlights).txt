    - Here's one of my axioms: Act first, explain later. Readers will wait a long time for explanatory material if there is solid action going on. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KN0JEYA&location=223))
    - In other words, hide the exposition within confrontation. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KN0JEYA&location=226))
