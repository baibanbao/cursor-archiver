- 不知不觉，元旦诗会已经举办了三年。第一次是2010年12月31日在花园西村西咖啡馆举办的跨年朗诵会，我当时写过一篇博客《[横跨两年的朗诵](http://dcc.ndhu.edu.tw/chenli/neruda-20.htm)》，2012年元旦是在滨江的蜜桃咖啡，从2013年开始，我和冯一刀都有家有口，跨年是跨不动了，就改在下午举行。当时在灵隐寺附近的樵食的帐篷里，大家围炉诵诗，也好不热闹。
- 2014年，叶子的Downtown网咖乐意承办这次诵诗会。叶子和冯一刀作了大量前期准备工作，包括：设计海报、打印诗歌、精选音乐、确认名单、布置场地、邀请歌手等等。没有他们两个，这次诗会铁定搞不成。
- 按照约定，诗会在下午2点举行，我12:30就从家开车出发，心想，一个半小时的时间，路上再怎么磨叽，也不可能迟到吧。然而，人算不如天算，我去城西接本次活动的另一位主持人流川枫老师的时候，她告诉我，刚刚起床，正在洗漱。我把车停到她的小区，进了路边一家玩具店，给儿子买了一把打肥皂泡的水枪。想不到，流川枫因为最近不再状态，磨蹭了半个多小时才出现。等我们开到西城广场的时候，已经1点55分了。
- 想不到城西富人区，停车是个大麻烦，地下车库全满，路边也停满，唯一一条通向地面停车场的小路上汽车犬牙交错。如果是我一个人来，估计转半个小时也不可能找到车位，但是上苍派来了伟大的流川枫。我把车丢给她，自己上楼去了。就在我等电梯的当儿，她打电话来说，车已停妥。原来有位奔驰司机看到她是美女的面子上，把路旁唯一一个车位让给了她！
- 活动基本按时举行。到场的诗歌爱好者有20多人，大家丢下庶务，围坐在一起，把接下来的两个小时留给诗歌。

- 令人惊叹的是，来自美国明尼苏达州的Richard用充满韵律感的语调，背诵了一首900个英文单词的长诗《一杯圣诞茶》。Tom Hegg的这首叙事诗，写给自己的姑姑，深沉质朴、温婉动人，凛凛有古风。姑姑因中风半身行动不便，但依然像往年那样邀请诗人去喝圣诞茶，诗人出于对病患的顾忌，起初不想去，但最后还是登门了。他发现姑姑虽然健康受损，但生命力依旧旺盛，她跛着腿给侄子烤的甜点，依然那么好吃。
- 现把这首美丽的诗篇原文照登如下，如果你懂英文的话，一定要读一读。如果你忙得连这么一首诗都不去读，那您可……真是个大忙人啊！
- A Cup of Christmas Tea
- ~ By Tom Hegg ~
- The log was in the fireplace, all spiced and set to burn.
- At last the yearly Christmas race was in the clubhouse turn.
- The cards were in the mail, all the gifts beneath the tree
- And 30 days reprieve till Visa could catch up with me.
- Though smug satisfaction seemed the order of the day,
- Something still was nagging me and would not go away.
- A week before, I got a letter from my old great Aunt.
- It read: "Of course I'll understand completely if you can't,
- But if you find you have some time how wonderful if we
- Could have a little chat and share a cup of Christmas tea."
- She'd had a mild stroke that year which crippled her left side.
- Though house bound now my folks had said it hadn't hurt her pride.
- They said: "She'd love to see you. What a nice thing it would be
- For you to go and maybe have a cup of Christmas tea."
- But boy! I didn't want to go. Oh, what a bitter pill
- To see an old relation and how far she'd gone downhill.
- I remembered her as vigorous, as funny and as bright.
- I remembered Christmas Eves when she regaled us half the night.
- I didn't want to risk all that. I didn't want the pain.
- I didn't need to be depressed. I didn't need the strain.
- And what about my brother? Why not him? She's his aunt, too!
- I thought I had it justified, but then before I knew
- The reasons not to go I so painstakingly had built
- Were cracking wide and crumbling in an acid rain of guilt.
- I put on boots and gloves and cap, shame stinging every pore
- And armed with squeegee, sand and map, I went out my front door.
- I drove in from the suburbs to the older part of town
- The pastels of the newer homes gave way to gray and brown.
- I had that disembodied feeling as the car pulled up
- And stopped beside the wooden house
- That held the Christmas cup.
- How I got up to her door I really couldn't tell . . .
- I watched my hand rise up and press the button of the bell.
- I waited, aided by my nervous rocking to and fro
- And just as I was thinking I should turn around and go
- I heard the rattle of the china in the hutch against the wall.
- The triple beat of two feet and a crutch came down the hall.
- The clicking of the door latch and the sliding of the bolt
- And a little swollen struggle popped it open with a jolt.
- She stood there pale and tiny, looking fragile as an egg.
- I forced myself from staring at the brace that held her leg.
- And though her thick bifocals
- Seemed to crack and spread her eyes,
- Their milky and refracted depths lit up with young surprise.
- "Come in!" "Come in!" She laughed the words.
- She took me by the hand
- And all my fears dissolved away as if by her command.
- We went inside and then before I knew how to react
- Before my eyes and ears and nose
- Was Christmas past . . . alive . . . intact!
- The scent of candied oranges, of cinnamon and pine,
- The antique wooden soldiers in their military line,
- The porcelain Nativity I'd always loved so much,
- The Dresden and the crystal I'd been told I mustn't touch.
- My spirit fairly bolted like a child out of class
- And danced among the ornaments of calico and glass.
- Like magic I was six again, deep in a Christmas spell
- Steeped in the million memories the boy inside knew well.
- And here among old Christmas cards so lovingly displayed
- A special place of honor for the ones we kids had made.
- And there, beside her rocking chair, the center of it all
- My great Aunt stood and said
- How nice it was that I had come to call.
- I sat and rattled on about the weather and the flu
- She listened very patiently then smiled and said, "What's new?"
- Thoughts and words began to flow. I started making sense.
- I lost the phony breeziness I use when I get tense.
- She was still passionately interested in everything I did.
- She was positive. Encouraging. Like when I was a kid.
- Simple generalities still sent her into fits
- She demanded the specifics . . . the particulars . . . the bits.
- We talked about the limitations that she'd had to face.
- She spoke with utter candor and with humor and good grace.
- Then defying the reality of crutch and straightened knee
- On wings of hospitality she flew to brew the tea.
- I sat alone with feelings that I hadn't felt in years.
- I looked around at Christmas through a thick hot blur of tears.
- And the candles and the holly she'd arranged on every shelf,
- The impossibly good cookies she still somehow baked herself.
- But these rich and tactile memories Became quite pale and thin
- When measured by the Christmas
- My great Aunt kept deep within.
- Her body halved and nearly spent, But my great Aunt was whole.
- I saw a Christmas miracle, the triumph of a soul.
- The triple beat of two feet and a crutch came down the hall.
- The rattle of the china in the hutch against the wall.
- She poured two cups, she smiled, And then she handed one to me.
- And then we settled back and had a cup of Christmas tea.
- 另外，附上冯一刀没有朗诵的一首原创诗
- **《12月12日》**
- 写于2010年12月12日
- by 冯一刀
- 没有女人
- 床是空的，也心是空的
- 这是多么令人沮丧的发现
- 曾经设想清灯孤寂的生活
- 隐居山林，甚至以此终老
- 这雨夜却教我格外想念女人
- 心里只有格外的惆怅
- “当时明月在，曾照彩云归”
- 错过了离开了的女人
- 所有的一切，证明了男人离不开女人
- 人生啊，是一条怎样的河流
- 让我们无法回到过去，也无法确定未来
- 谁是那个在有一天早晨——
- 她的鼻息轻轻冲到你的脸上
- 而你会像婴儿般享受她的注视
