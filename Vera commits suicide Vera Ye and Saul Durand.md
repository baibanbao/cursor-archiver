\[birds singing in distance\]

\[machinery humming\]

\[key card reader buzzes\]

\[rapid typing\]

\[humming continues, muffled\]

I knew you’d be the last one here.

Here till the lights go out, boss.

I keep thinking if I just stare at the screen long enough,

something will come to me.

They’ve shut the project down.

Mm-hmm.

But the power’s on till midnight, so…

You told us, “It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is.”

“If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.”

I think that was Feynman. But yeah.

According to the experiments, all of our theories are wrong.

All of them.

All of the physics of the past 60 years is wrong.

Science is broken.

\[exhales sharply\]

\[takes a deep breath\]

You were just a baby.

You’re not throwing this away, are you?

\[gently\] Oh, Saul. You mustn’t.

You still demonstrate great potential for future scientific accomplishment.

Missed my window.

“A person who has not made

his great contribution to science before the age of 30 will never do so.”

How old are you? Thirty-one?

Thirty-two.

Einstein wasn’t right about everything.

\[softly\] Hmm.

If anyone can figure this out, it’s you.

Saul.

Yeah?

\[haunting orchestral music playing\]

Do you believe in God?

Is that what it’s come to?

No. I don’t.

I accept that this defies all known laws of physics,

but… I don’t think that’s an argument for God.

So, what’s left?

\[haunting strings building\]

\[door opens\]

\[sensors humming\]

\[door closes\]

\[mechanical droning reverberates\]

\[inhales sharply\]
