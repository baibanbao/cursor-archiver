    - The Road Not Taken
    - [[Robert Frost]]
    - Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    - And sorry I could not travel both
    - {{[[TODO]]}} And be one traveler, long I stood
    - And looked down one as far as I could
    - To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    - Then took the other, as just as fair,
    - And having perhaps the better claim
    - Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
    - Though as for that the passing there
    - Had worn them really about the same,
    - And both that morning equally lay
    - In leaves no step had trodden black.
    - Oh, I kept the first for another day!
    - Yet knowing how way leads on to way
    - I doubted if I should ever come back.
    - I shall be telling this with a sigh
    - Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    - Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
    - I took the one less traveled by,
    - And that has made all the difference.
