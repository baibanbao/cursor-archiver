- 先看一首诗
- Chinese Girl
- Surrounded by each other Jackie Chan.
- We only wanna major biddy koo,
- Too many ladies looking at Japan!
- They even need no Easter bunny woo.
- Are you not ever loving any sailor,
- Human being flying over yu!
- So busy having such a mischief maker,
- Who likes to see a pretty little poo.
- This world is really very handsome young!
- The love of lovely people like Chinese!
- And never sing about an English kung,
- Maybe something from the Japanese.
- I paint a picture on the handy mai,
- Offer me a bowl of chocolate thai.
