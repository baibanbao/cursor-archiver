Transcript "Every Kid Needs a Champion"
0:00 Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast
0:13 I have spent my entire life
0:16 either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse,
0:21 or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.
0:23 (Laughter)
0:24 Both my parents were educators,
0:27 my maternal grandparents were educators,
0:30 and for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing.
0:34 And so, needless to say, over those years
0:36 I've had a chance to look at education reform
0:40 from a lot of perspectives.
0:42 Some of those reforms have been good.
0:44 Some of them have been not so good.
0:46 And we know why kids drop out.
0:48 We know why kids don't learn.
0:49 It's either poverty, low attendance,
0:52 negative peer influences...
0:55 We know why.
0:56 But one of the things that we never discuss
0:59 or we rarely discuss
1:01 is the value and importance of human connection.
1:05 Relationships.
1:08 James Comer says that no significant learning
1:11 can occur without a significant relationship.
1:14 George Washington Carver says all learning
1:17 is understanding relationships.
1:21 Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.
1:26 For years, I have watched people teach.
1:31 I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst.
1:34 A colleague said to me one time,
1:36 "They don't pay me to like the kids.
1:39 They pay me to teach a lesson.
1:40 The kids should learn it.
1:42 I should teach it, they should learn it,
1:44 Case closed."
1:45 Well, I said to her,
1:48 "You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."
1:51 (Laughter)
1:53 (Applause)
1:59 She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."
2:02 And I said to her,
2:03 "Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear."
2:08 Needless to say, it was.
2:09 Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship,
2:13 or you don't.
2:15 I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
2:17 He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things,
2:20 like seeking first to understand,
2:23 as opposed to being understood.
2:25 Simple things, like apologizing.
2:28 You ever thought about that?
2:29 Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
2:31 (Laughter)
2:33 I taught a lesson once on ratios.
2:35 I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.
2:38 (Laughter)
2:39 And I got back and looked at that teacher edition.
2:42 I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
2:44 (Laughter)
2:45 So I came back to class the next day and I said,
2:47 "Look, guys, I need to apologize.
2:50 I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry."
2:54 They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.
2:55 You were so excited, we just let you go."
3:02 I have had classes that were so low,
3:07 so academically deficient, that I cried.
3:10 I wondered, "How am I going to take this group,
3:13 in nine months,
3:15 from where they are to where they need to be?
3:18 And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
3:22 How do I raise the self-esteem of a child
3:24 and his academic achievement at the same time?
3:27 One year I came up with a bright idea.
3:29 I told all my students,
3:31 "You were chosen to be in my class
3:35 because I am the best teacher
3:36 and you are the best students,
3:38 they put us all together
3:39 so we could show everybody else how to do it."
3:43 One of the students said, "Really?"
3:45 (Laughter)
3:47 I said, "Really. We have to show the other classes
3:50 how to do it, so when we walk down the hall,
3:53 people will notice us, so you can't make noise.
3:55 You just have to strut."
3:57 (Laughter)
3:58 And I gave them a saying to say:
4:00 "I am somebody.
4:01 I was somebody when I came.
4:02 I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
4:04 I am powerful, and I am strong.
4:06 I deserve the education that I get here.
4:09 I have things to do, people to impress,
4:11 and places to go."
4:13 And they said, "Yeah!"
4:14 (Laughter)
4:16 You say it long enough,
4:17 it starts to be a part of you.
4:21 (Applause)
4:28 I gave a quiz, 20 questions.
4:31 A student missed 18.
4:34 I put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.
4:37 (Laughter)
4:39 He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"
4:43 I said, "Yes."
4:44 (Laughter)
4:45 He said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?"
4:49 I said, "Because you're on a roll.
4:51 You got two right. You didn't miss them all."
4:54 (Laughter)
4:55 I said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?"
4:58 He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."
5:01 You see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.
5:04 "+2" said, "I ain't all bad."
5:12 For years, I watched my mother take the time at recess to review,
5:19 go on home visits in the afternoon,
5:21 buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers
5:24 to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat,
5:27 and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good.
5:30 See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
5:32 (Laughter)
5:34 And kids can be cruel.
5:36 And so she kept those things in her desk,
5:39 and years later, after she retired,
5:42 I watched some of those same kids come through
5:45 and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,
5:47 you made a difference in my life.
5:50 You made it work for me.
5:51 You made me feel like I was somebody,
5:53 when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
5:56 And I want you to just see what I've become."
5:58 And when my mama died two years ago at 92,
6:01 there were so many former students at her funeral,
6:05 it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone,
6:07 but because she left a legacy of relationships
6:11 that could never disappear.
6:13 Can we stand to have more relationships?
6:17 Absolutely.
6:18 Will you like all your children? Of course not.
6:21 (Laughter)
6:23 And you know your toughest kids are never absent.
6:27 (Laughter)
6:29 Never.
6:30 You won't like them all,
6:32 and the tough ones show up for a reason.
6:35 It's the connection. It's the relationships.
6:44 So teachers become great actors and great actresses,
6:48 and we come to work when we don't feel like it,
6:50 and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense,
6:53 and we teach anyway.
6:56 We teach anyway, because that's what we do.
7:00 Teaching and learning should bring joy.
7:03 How powerful would our world be
7:06 if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks,
7:10 who were not afraid to think,
7:11 and who had a champion?
7:12 Every child deserves a champion,
7:15 an adult who will never give up on them,
7:17 who understands the power of connection,
7:20 and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
7:24 Is this job tough? You betcha.
7:26 Oh God, you betcha.
7:28 But it is not impossible.
7:32 We can do this. We're educators.
7:33 We're born to make a difference.
7:36 Thank you so much.
7:37 (Applause)
