中国驻日内瓦联合国大使，针对美国批评中国扩张军备，近日接受了BBC的专访。在节目中，沙大使义正词严，豪情盖天，对美国人怒吼了一句：Shut up!

这在中国外交官中是不多见的。中国外交人员平常给人的印象是温良恭俭让、王顾左右而言他，但是沙大使毫不隐瞒对美国人的鄙视，让美国人闭嘴、收声，写下了了新政时期实力外交的新篇章。

这段录音是我从2006年8月17日BBC的节目中剪辑制作出来的，现在免费放到网上。所有懂英语的中国人，都应当听；不懂英语的中国人，学会英语也要听；所有国际友人，尤其是喜读江选的友人，更应该听！

所有博客管理者，都应当把本录音上首页；所有BBS斑竹，都应当把本录音置顶！

--------------------------------------------

China's economy is expanding fast, but its militay expanding is going faster.

Robert Captlin, who teaches at the US Navy Acedemy , says it is going to change the balance of power in Asia.

"China is re-emerging totally legitimately as a great economic power and throughout history when large countries emerged as great economic powers, military might follow. "

And that's got the Pentagon worried while the White House is upset with the war on terror. US Defence Secrect Donald Ramsfield says that China spends a lot on arms secretly. He believes it is now the world's biggest military spender after US and Russia. Robert Captlin again.

" The Chinses defence budget has been growing in double digits relative to the total economy for years now. That in all of itself shows dramatic rises in defence spending that are not across the board are extremly well-targeted by not just diesel but nuclear power, submarines, make investements in missile technology that can hit moving targets it sees".

"It's better for you to shut up and keep quiet. it's much much better ."

Rebus language from one of China's most senior diplomats Sha Zukang, China ambassor to the UN in Geneva. In a far from inscrutable interview for the BBC, he said he is tired of lectures on defence spending, expecially lectures from Washington.

"What I want to tell you is that are you the number one? Is it true that you have almost 50% of the world's military budget? And China's population is six times or five times that of the United States. Why blame China? No! Forget it. It's high time to shut up! It's US sovereign right to do whatever they think good for them. But don't tell us what is good for China. Thank you very much."

So, why is China spending so much on its military,particularily, its navy? Analysis' say the reason is tied up with the central-formed policy preoccupation--Taiwan.

"Taiwan prepares its defences, China's exercises off the coast have begun."

10 years ago China launched a huge military excercise in a spat over Taiwanese move towards independence. President Clinton sent two aircraft carriers to warn the Chinese off. Robert Captlin says that incident focused the minds of Chinese military planners, that's changing the rules of the game for America.

"In Iraq, we've seen the low end of ancient method of warfare. The Chinese are about to teach us many lessons in the coming decade in the high end. Remember, the United States' navy has been used to going completely unchallenged. That is gonna change, because the Chinese are investing heavily in submarines and missile technology that can essentially lock the United States out of the Taiwan straits."

That won't mean the Chinese navy could defeat the Americans, but they could constrain them.

Ambassdor Sha's unequivocal that it's a cause for which China will go to the war.
"The moment of taiwan's declaire of independence supported by whoever,China will have no choice. We will do the business through whatever means available to my government. Nobody should have illusion on that. We will do the business at any cost, "

"So high price to pay...

"You are right, you are right. You know, I said at any cost. It's not a matter of how big taiwan is,but for China,one inch of the territory is more valuable than the life of our people.We will never concealed that."
