Blue

Blue Jade, my dear
Your breast is enough
for me.
Your lips are special
to me. 
Your thighs, your knees, your ankles  are enough
for me.
Your body are locked,
but I have found the key.
Let me press the buttons,
with my rough hands
On your breast
Underneath your thigh.
Dear blue wind,
Sigh as you like
Yell as you will
I will dig and dig
Till your oils are pumped
Moisture is rising in your grass
above the secret cave
Guide me, hold my flag
to plug on your emptiness
I have been ready for that
All my romantic affairs are just drills
Now it's the real battle
Let me be
Let me in
Let me up
Let me down
Let me be part of you
Let me be your part
Let me squeeze you
for honey
for milk
for precious liquid
Let me search you in and out
Till you are shot
Till you are filled
Till you are satisfied as you never be.

I am coming to your breasts
I am coming to your thigh
I am coming to your belly
I am coming to your pearl in the ocean
Let me fill you with my wild, even filthy imagination
Baby blue
Baby Jade.
