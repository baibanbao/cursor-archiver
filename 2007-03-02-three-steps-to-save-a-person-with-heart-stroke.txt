刚刚收到一封邮件，跟那些连锁信不一样，这封信是教人如何用简单的三招，辨别你周围的人是否正收到心肌梗塞或者心脏病的威胁。

英文很长，我简单地说一下。有一个人参加烧烤聚会，忽然摔倒在地，大家都不在意，他也没往心里去，站起来继续吃。聚会结束后，这个人送医院不治身亡。大家忽然想起，他刚才是心脏出了问题。

如何防止因心脏出问题而发生的猝死，心脏病专家强烈推荐大家用简单的三个办法，进行测试。
**
1、让对方笑一笑。
2、让对方说句话。**说一个简单的句子，比如：我刚才吃了烤全羊。
**3、让对方把双臂举起来**。

如果上述三项有一项做不到，记住，立即拨打急救热线。

发邮件的人说，如果大家都学会三招，可能会从周围出意外的十个人中救活一个人。

是不是普及众生啊，大家都互相转告转告吧。英文原件附后。





<blockquote>STROKE: Remember The 1st Three Letters... S.T.R.
[]
My friend sent this to me and encouraged me to post it and spread the word.
I agree. If everyone can remember something this simple, we could save some
folks. Seriously.. Please read:

STROKE IDENTIFICATION:
During a BBQ, a friend stumbled and took a little fall - she assured
everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) and just
tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. They got her cleaned up and
got her a new plate of food - while she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid
went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Ingrid's husband
called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital
- (at 6:00pm , Ingrid passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ.
Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Ingrid would
be with us today. Some don't die. They end up in a helpless, hopeless
condition instead. It only takes a minute to read this...
A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he
can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He said the trick
was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient
medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.

RECOGNIZING A STROKE
Thank God for the sense to remember the "3" steps, STR . Read and Learn!
Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately,
the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe
brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.

Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple
questions:

S * Ask the individual to SMILE .
T * Ask the person to TALK to SPEAK A SIMPLE     SENTENCE (Coherently)
(i.e. . . It is sunny out today).
R * Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS .

NOTE : Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out
their tongue. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the
other that is also an indication of a stroke. If he or she has trouble with
ANY ONE of these tasks, call 000   immediately!! and describe the symptoms
to the dispatcher.

A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this e-mail sends it to 10 people;
you can bet that at least one life will be saved.</blockquote>
