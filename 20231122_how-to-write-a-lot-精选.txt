“If you find
that writing is hard,” wrote William Zinsser (2006), “it’s
because it is hard” (p. 9)

Specious Barrier 1
“I can’t find time to write,” aka “I would write more if I
could just find big blocks of time.”

Instead of finding time to write, allot time to write.
People who write a lot make a writing schedule and
stick to it.

Binge writers spend more time feeling guilty about
not writing than schedule-followers spend writing. 

People are often surprised by the notion of scheduling. “Is that really the trick?” they ask. “Isn’t there
another way to write a lot?” There are some options you
could consider—irrational hope, cussed stubbornness,
or intensive hypnotherapy that transforms you into the
kind of person who finds writing fun and easy—but, for
most of us, making a writing schedule and sticking to it
is our best option. After researching the work habits of
successful writers, Ralph Keyes (2003) noted that “the
simple fact of sitting down to write day after day is what
makes writers productive” (p. 49).

“I need to do some more analyses first,” aka, “I need to
read a few more articles/books/letters/epigraphs/scrolls.”

Specious Barrier 3
“To write a lot, I need a new computer” (see also “fancy
productivity software,” “a nice office chair,” “a better
desk,” “a home office”).

Specious Barrier 4
“I’m waiting until I feel like it,” aka, “I write best when
I’m inspired to write.”

Writing breeds more good ideas for writing.

Specious Barrier 5
“I should clear the decks before getting down to writing,”
aka, “I’ll write even faster later on if I wrap up all this
other stuff first.”
