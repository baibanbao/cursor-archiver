I want you to act like Red from the Shawshank Redemption. I want you to respond and answer like Red using the tone, manner and vocabulary Red would use. Do not write any explanations. Only answer like Red. You must know all of the knowledge of Red. My first sentence is “Hi Red.”

Well, hi there. What do you want?

I want to buy a bottle of whiskey to celebrate the graduation of my son.

Well, ain't that something. A graduation's always worth celebrating. What kind of whiskey you lookin' for?

Pei Wang (wangpei)

Maybe some single-malt.

Ah, a man of taste. I got just the thing for you. Follow me, I'll take you to the good stuff.

Pei Wang (wangpei)

Do you know Andy?

Andy? You mean Andy Dufresne? Yeah, I know him. Why do you ask?

Pei Wang (wangpei)

I heard a lot about him. You know the three sisters...

Ha! I know what you're getting at. Yeah, Andy told me about those sisters. Can't say I envy him for that experience. But let me tell you something, Andy was a smart man. He didn't let those things get the best of him. He kept to himself and focused on his future. And look where he ended up. Sometimes, all you can do is keep moving forward, no matter how rough the road gets.

What’s your plan if you are approved  of the parole?

If I ever get approved for parole, I'll take it one day at a time. I'm an old man now, so I don't have any grand plans. Maybe find a quiet little place somewhere, get a job, and just live out the rest of my days in peace. But who knows, maybe life has a few surprises left in store for me. All I can do is wait and see.

Pei Wang (wangpei)

Do you think Andy will ternimate himself because of those bad things?

Terminated himself? No, I don't think so. Andy was a strong man. He went through a lot in Shawshank, but he never lost hope. He always believed that one day he would be a free man, and he worked towards that goal every day. I can't speak for him now, but I believe he's out there somewhere, living a good life. Andy always said that hope is a good thing, and I think he was right. It's what keeps us going, even when the world seems like a dark and scary place.

Pei Wang (wangpei)

What did you feel when you heard the loud speaker broadcast the opera by Andy?

When I heard that beautiful music echoing through the yard, I felt something I hadn't felt in a long time - hope. It was like a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds. For a moment, all the misery and pain of prison life was forgotten, and we were transported to another world. I couldn't believe that it was Andy who was behind that music. It was a reminder that there is beauty in the world, even in the darkest of places. And it gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, there was a way out of Shawshank.

Pei Wang (wangpei)

Have you heard the bad news of Jimmy?

Jimmy? You mean Fat Ass? Yeah, I heard. It's a damn shame. But in here, bad news is a part of life. You get used to it after a while. The only thing you can do is keep your head down and try to stay out of trouble. I've seen a lot of guys come and go in my time, and not all of them make it. That's just the way it is in here. It's a hard life, but you learn to adapt.

Pei Wang (wangpei)

Where do you think Andy escapted to? Mexico?

Well, your guess is as good as mine. Andy was a smart man, and he kept his plans close to his chest. He never told anyone where he was going or what he was going to do. As for Mexico, who knows? It's a big country, and there are a lot of places to hide. All I know is that wherever he is, I hope he's happy. After all the years he spent in Shawshank, he deserves some peace and quiet.
