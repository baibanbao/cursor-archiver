    - Well, if you choose wrong, you’ve written your own death sentence. Perhaps. But for the first time in years, I felt unburdened. Free. I remembered the promise I had made to myself long ago. Cancer had taken my past and would take my future, but it wouldn’t take my present. It was time to make those words mean something. As I sat there, in that cold office, whatever was left of my life became crystal clear. It was time to live. Really live. I ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSBVHDE&location=1064))

The plan I was formulating was to travel around this magnificent country, experiencing the places I’d always wanted to see and visiting with people who had so enriched my life over the fifteen years I’d taught, people I loved, who loved me—my students.

    - Before anybody gets weepy-eyed, let me just fill you in on my plan. I’m taking to the road.
