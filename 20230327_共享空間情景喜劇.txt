Today I will meet Mr.Chen, he wants to talk to me about comic short films. would you pls give some ideas of it? the budget should be low and the length is less than 10 minutes per film.

Of course! Creating a comic short film can be a fun and creative project, and it's definitely possible to do so with a low budget and within a 10-minute time frame. Here are a few ideas to consider:

The Roommate Mix-up:

Create a story about two people who accidentally become roommates due to a mix-up by their rental agency. They have completely opposite personalities and lifestyles, leading to a series of hilarious situations as they try to coexist in the same space.

Time Travel Mishap:

A character finds a mysterious device that allows them to time travel. However, every time they use it, they end up in an unexpected era or situation, creating humorous moments as they try to navigate their way back home.

The Superhero Next Door:

A regular person discovers their neighbor is actually a bumbling, inept superhero who constantly gets into trouble. The protagonist must help their superhero neighbor out of various comedic predicaments.

Lost in Translation:

Two characters from different countries or cultures meet, and neither speaks the other's language. They must rely on exaggerated gestures, body language, and funny misunderstandings to communicate with each other.

The Talent Show:

A group of friends with no discernible talent decides to enter a local talent show. They brainstorm and rehearse a series of hilariously bad acts, culminating in a chaotic but entertaining final performance.

The Unwanted Gift:

A character receives an unusual, seemingly useless gift that turns out to have unexpected consequences. The story revolves around their attempts to get rid of the gift without offending the person who gave it to them.

The Ultimate Prank War:

Two friends engage in an escalating series of pranks, each trying to outdo the other in creativity and ridiculousness. The climax could involve a big reveal, where they discover that they've been pranking someone else entirely.

Remember to focus on strong characters, witty dialogue, and relatable situations to create engaging and funny short films. Good luck with your meeting with Mr. Chen!
