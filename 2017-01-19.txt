I have come back to Shandong for 3 days. The sky is smoky, the air, smelly, the environment, stupidly and systematically contaminated. This is my hometown, a fallen county.

I stayed at home. The only shelter I have is my parents' house, which is spacious enough. I don't know how can people survive in such a place. Who is the criminal? No one knows.

We will leave this place in several weeks. However, my parents and fellow people can go no where. Wish I could do anything for this, but I feel vonerable. Maybe the only way is to make ourselves stronger and more powerful. But it is only a math.

The people live in delusion. What they care about is how to make more DNA-bearers. The want to have the second child and want it desperately. The brother of my classmate will have twins as his wife are pregnant. The only problem is they are too old to do so. They are in their fifties.

What can I do to this place where I had been brought up? I have no idea. Despair and departing is the only answer.
