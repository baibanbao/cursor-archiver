I want to use GPT-4 to build a new product which will integrate to my business. 

Now I am the founder of AI Story Writing Camp. 

AI Story Writing Camp is an online and offline training to improve writing efficiency by using GPT technology, and the main speaker is Wang Pei, a screenwriter contracted by Beijing Ren Yi.

Objective: To use ChatGPT and other AI technologies as writing assistants to improve writing efficiency and inspire creativity.

Elements.

Mastering the use of GPT operation
Provide various story writing cases and guidance
Improve writing speed up to 5000 words/hour

If I could get gpt-4 api, I will use it to set up a service to enable my students to experience the powerful Chatgpt in a new way. 

I will learn the code of https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web 

and build up my own ChatGPT services in compliance with the TOS of OpenAI API. 

Please help me to fulfill this dream.

Thank you.
