Upon The Nipples Of Julia's Breast

Have ye beheld (with much delight)
A red rose peeping through a white?
Or else a cherry (double graced)
Within a lily? Centre placed?
Or ever marked the pretty beam
A strawberry shows half drowned in cream?
Or seen rich rubies blushing through
A pure smooth pearl, and orient too?
So like to this, nay all the rest,
Is each neat niplet of her breast.

This is the key to it.
This is the key to everything.
Preciously.

I am worse than the gamekeeper's children
picking for dust and bread.
Here I am drumming up perfume.

Let me go down on your carpet,
your straw mattress - whatever's at hand
because the child in me is dying, dying.

It is not that I am cattle to be eaten.
It is not that I am some sort of street.
But your hands found me like an architect.

Jugful of milk! It was yours years ago
when I lived in the valley of my bones,
bones dumb in the swamp. Little playthings.

A xylophone maybe with skin
stretched over it awkwardly.
Only later did it become something real.

Later I measured my size against movie stars.
I didn't measure up. Something between
my shoulders was there. But never enough.

Sure, there was a meadow,
but no yound men singing the truth.
Nothing to tell truth by.

Ignorant of men I lay next to my sisters
and rising out of the ashes I cried
my sex will be transfixed!

Now I am your mother, your daughter, your brand new thing - a snail, a nest.
I am alive when your fingers are.

I wear silk - the cover to uncover -
because silk is what I want you to think of.
But I dislike the cloth. It is too stern.

So tell me anything but track me like a climber
for here is the eye, here is the jewel,
here is the excitement the nipple learns.

I am unbalanced - but I am not mad with snow.
I am mad the way young girls are mad,
with an offering, an offering…

I burn the way money burns.

My favorite past time has always been,
Caressing your breasts, from beginning to end.
First one then the other, taking turns,
Licking them gently as your body burns.
Then softly biting the left one first,
Finishing with the right, to slake my thirst.
My favorite past time I have to say,
Be it nighttime or be it day.
I love your breasts yes I know,
So round and firm, The best in show.

Ode To The Breasts Of A Woman Poem by alexander opicho
Ode To The Breasts Of A Woman
♡
Autoplay

in my state of being a deadly sex rapscallion
i knew not why there are breasts on a woman
i had often rushed down to the south
seeking for selfish sensation in wanton of her
a woman whose freedom i devoured
she persevered solemnly without my know

let me accede to my audience with all honesty
the breasts of a woman is a treasure of nature
a beacon of creation for peaceful humanity
touch them fondly with a pinch of compassion
be patient with them for they were your first food
fondle them patiently they are amber of fire

sing to them a poem in sweet love of them
they will stand erect pointing at the sun
breaking eyes of your beautiful love
as her heart unto you soft is gone
you must treasure the breasts of a woman
with your warm volley of kisses
more than you scamper for her fine thighs
for the power in the thighs comes from
the warmth in the glorified breasts

There is nothing but mystery
Around every fleeting kiss
As we crawl on the beach
After prowling all night like cats,
I wish we were entwined on a city roof
Completely naked in the moonlight,
I’m not satisfied with anemic dreams
Or love making that utters quiet squeaks,
I’ve made offerings to Aphrodite,
Remember that when I fondle your breasts,
Our hearts are tangled in a sensual web,
There is water from soft lakes on your skin,
I’m going to dive into your soul and swim,
Let this relationship blossom into poetic myth,
Let future scholars interpret it,
Every lesson of illicit love will spring from our book.

The First Lucky Boy To Kiss Your Virgin Breasts Poem by Uriah Hamilton
The First Lucky Boy To Kiss Your Virgin Breasts
Rating: ★4.7

Woman, you are the one who lingers
In my mind with aching tenderness,
But you are hidden in the distance,
Walking through the business world
With your stately shoulders
In a summer dress;
Your smile is brief and suggests
Inner-stirring ideas
For the moment suppressed.

Are your thoughts
All professional and money related?
Or do you drift
Into your young girl affairs
And the first lucky boy
To kiss your virgin breasts?

I would have been
That fortunate and karma-blessed boy
If circumstance and geography
Would have brought me
To the wondrous parks and haunts
Of your girlhood dreams.

It would have been love
And I wouldn’t have lost you
To indelicate or cruel mistakes of time,
I would have cherished your breath
And would have kept you
Like a mystical and sacred locket
Forever next to my heart.

Breast Of A Virgin Poem by Ajaegbu Charles
Breast Of A Virgin
♡
Autoplay

Here i am
To surrender to your bossom
And to my desire to possess them
This enchantment ensures love,
Passion, pliable and aura.

This fantasy fascinates libido
This is no fallacy yet imaginative
I have lost grip of self-absorbness
Ability to reason straight
fallen from uneven trap.

Oh breasts of a virgin
An iota of fallen paradise
Like mount zion;
The hills can never be shaken
The author and finisher of pleasure
Firm and immovable as a rock
Nudge with the treasure of diamond
nipples.

It is it I see
Behind the scrutiny of white pyjamas
I yearn to gnaw these magical breasts
With my mouth, my hands, my tongue;
Alluring her endless pleasure
Volatile of being repress.

Oh breasts of a virgin
Full, heavy, and natty;
Beautiful, creative and thrilling;
Finesse, ethereal and seductive
Mythic, mysterious and mystical
Although subtle.

When i draw nigh these freeting breasts
When my eyelids close in aphrodisiac
When my breath soar through cleavage
realm
A fantasy come to life
Overtly but much more often
This one part that stirs imagination and
demeanor
Purely sensual yet ensnarous.

Oh breasts of a virgin
These before me;
In front of my eyes
Overlapping into my hands
Her prototype is Aphrodite
Condensing in my very mouth
Resistance will only spur my desire
Enflaming this seduction the more
This succulent I succumb.

These breasts of a virgin!
This frail sentiment of pleasure
This bossom of a virgin
I rely for succour.

Your breasts are not uncommon,
Like of which there are millions.
Yet at their contour, I grow erotic
‘Cause I haven’t seen them bare.

Your Breasts Are Mountain Hills Poem by Emmanuel George Cefai
Your Breasts Are Mountain Hills

Your breasts are mountain hills
Fostering a green vale without streams
I would be in the vale and rise with it
And fall with every gentle breath
Feeling the gentle trembling beneath my feet
Like gentle earthquakes:
Then let me sink in the warm mists
That from the valley rise and founder there.

Woman's Breasts Poem by Randy McClave
Woman's Breasts
♡
Autoplay

She told me more than a mouthful is just a waste
Larger the size she said takes away from the firmness and the taste,
Smaller and the firmer is the best way for any man to enjoy
But, then I said to her; If you are too small they may think you are a boy.
Though on the counterpart I know one thing that is a fact
More men like myself like a woman who is stacked,
We men like more breasts to see and more cleavage to behold
Though I am sounding truthful, and not trying to sound obnoxious or bold.
The size of a woman breast is like comparing a melon to a grape
Men sometimes go for the quantity, and not for the quality and the shape,
As a man I will say for grapes and melons I enjoy them both
If I had to chose one over the other, I couldn't, and that's my oath.
The grape is firm and beautiful and it is gone with just one taste
While the melon can be savored, and enjoyed without worry or haste,
Women who have small breasts they do though have one advantage
They are easier to get dressed, as their breasts are simpler to manage.
A woman's breasts are the magnets which attract every hot blooded male
And that is the truth known by every devious man seeking female,
They say all women enjoy it when a man looks into their eyes
That is one reason why some women enjoy the smaller cup size.
Though they show not much cleavage from their small chests
Some men truly enjoys a woman who has very small breasts,
There are some women who must wear a stuffed or push-up bra
As they try to entice men with their new size with excitement and awe.
But, then when the woman undresses to excitedly entice the man later
In his hands he will be holding wishes and hopes in the form of tissue paper,
On a mans point of view a woman's breasts give us all men the fits
And whether they are large or small, man enjoys a woman's tits.

As I Lay With My Head On Your Breast Camarada Poem by Sidney P. Roberts II
As I Lay With My Head On Your Breast Camarada
Rating: ★2.3
♡


As I lay with my head on your breast camarada,
As I breathe you inhaling your exhales,
As I feel your heartbeat,
Slow,
Slow, against my cheek,
As your fingers stroke gently the small of my back,
My stubbly head, the nape of my neck,
As softly I touch exploring,
Your moist thighs, your round hips, your slim waist,
As curious I probe your navel with finger,
I ponder a moment my self:
A youth interrupted then stolen by war,
A city submerged in a flood,
A trust betrayed by solemn oath broken,
I have been suspicious, somber, and mean.
I am sorry.
But I, here, resting quietly with you,
In peace now, on this day on this morning,
With you inside me and me inside you,
With acceptance, affection, and trust,
With my flesh to your flesh,
With my soul to your soul,
My love I have never felt better.

Sidney P. Roberts II
