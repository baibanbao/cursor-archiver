Here is a plan to integrate GPT-4 into your zhongwen.ai learning portal:

Use GPT-4 for customized essay prompts. You can have students input their interests, hobbies, favorite books, etc. and GPT-4 can generate personalized essay prompts tailored to their needs. This makes writing more engaging and fun for students.

Use GPT-4 as an automatic essay scorer. GPT-4 has been trained on a huge amount of data so it can evaluate essays based on coherence, logic, grammar, vocabulary, and other attributes. It can score students' essays and provide constructive feedback. This helps take the burden off human teachers.

Build a smart writing assistant with GPT-4. Students can have conversations with the assistant to get suggestions for essay ideas, ask questions during the writing process, get recommendations for revisions, etc. The assistant can provide customized help to each student 24/7.

Use GPT-4 for topic modeling and content recommendation. By analyzing all student essays, GPT-4 can discover trending topics and areas of interest. It can then recommend content like books, movies, podcasts, and other media related to those topics so students can expand their knowledge.

Apply GPT-4 at different levels based on students' language abilities. For beginners, GPT-4 can focus on basic vocabulary, grammar, and short-form content. For advanced students, GPT-4 can generate more complex prompts, evaluate higher-level essays, and recommend higher- difficulty content. This progressive approach works for students of all skill levels.

Continue using your existing NLP techniques along with GPT-4. GPT-4 can enhance the capabilities of zhongwen.ai but should not replace existing tools and workflows that already benefit your students. Use GPT-4 judiciously with close oversight and monitoring.

Focus on AI safety for any GPT-4 systems. Carefully evaluate and align GPT-4 models to ensure they behave ethically and benefit students. Monitor for potential issues and make corrections to the models if needed. AI safety should be a top priority when working with advanced technologies.
