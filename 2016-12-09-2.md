- This morning, I spent 1 hour editting the profile of my Linkedin account.[Edit Profile | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wangpei) Why bother? As you know, Linkedin is for the full time employees. For me as a freelancer and self-employed writer, why I need this stuff?
- The reason is simple. I need organize myself.
- Linkedin is a website designed for all the professionals, no matter self-employed or other-employed? If you want to be professional, or as the Germen words for profession—if you want to respond the calling, you should treat yourself as one.
- As a screenwriter and professional writer, I don’t expect that a tycoon from Holywood or a millionair of Forbes coming to me because of viewing my profile. I just want to be responsible to myself and treat my writing career seriously. I don’t work it for fun or for mere interest. No, I work for something greater, honor, glory, happiness.
- So I keep updating my Linkedin. I think the complicated reward system of life will pay off.
