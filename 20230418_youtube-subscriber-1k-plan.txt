By analyzing engagement metrics, we can also identify which types of content your audience is responding to the most and create more of that type of content.

Based on this analysis, I recommend the following plan to improve your YouTube channel:

Research the top YouTubers in your niche and identify what they are doing differently. Analyze their content, style, and upload frequency to create a content calendar that aligns with their success.
