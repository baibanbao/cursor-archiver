- Of course, life being the way it is, some of the others have moved on—passed away or drifted away, so that we’re no longer connected the way we used to be. But for whatever it was that brought us together way back when, you have my thanks.

    - I also chose a new screenplay—Avatar—to analyze in detail, along with new scripts to illustrate character categories, character growth, and theme, and charting your screenplay.
    - I’ve added an entire chapter on exceptions to the rules, to examine successful screenplays that don’t follow the traditional Hollywood model.
    - If you want to be a screenwriter, you’ll still encounter lots of people who’ll try to discourage you from your dream, and who’ll tell you it’s dumb or impossible. And the only way to overcome that is still to ignore them, stay with your passion, and hit the keyboard.
    - The wonderful thing about reading these acknowledgments from so long ago is the realization that most of these people are still an important part of my life.

    - 4.   No matter how much new technology can be thrown into a movie, and no matter what new stars or concepts or directors are hot, the foundation of any successful film will always be a good, well-written story. A bad movie can be made out of a good script but never the reverse. Hollywood will always need the screenwriter.
    - 7.   The screenwriting process can be broken down into a proven series of steps and stages, which will enable you to achieve a salable, emotionally involving screenplay.


8.   You can be a working screenwriter and live anywhere in the world.
    - 9.   You can launch a career as a screenwriter even if you don’t know anyone within a thousand miles of southern California.


And finally:


10. You can make a bundle of money doing all of this.

    - The screenwriter’s primary goal is even more specific: The screenwriter must elicit emotion in the person who reads the screenplay.
    - Knowing what a screenplay needs to accomplish is simple; I can tell it to you in one sentence: Enable a sympathetic character to overcome a series of increasingly difficult, seemingly insurmountable obstacles to achieve a compelling desire.
    - Just one more major step before diving into your screenplay: you’ve got to see movies.
    - You wouldn’t want to be represented by a lawyer who hadn’t been to law school or who didn’t keep abreast of recent legal decisions and statutes. Well, the film industry isn’t looking for screenwriters who don’t know what’s being produced or who don’t know which of those recent releases have been successful.
    - 1.   You don’t have time.
    - 2.   You can’t afford it.
    - 3.   You have children.
    - I know that families can sometimes become obstacles to your screen-writing pursuits. You must sit down with them and explain how important this dream is to you, and that going to see movies isn’t just for fun and entertainment anymore; it’s as important as taking classes would be if you were a real estate appraiser or an architect. At first they’ll look skeptical and whine about being neglected. But the more seriously you take your career, the more seriously they will.
    - If you aren’t going to the movies or watching television because you don’t like what Hollywood’s producing these days (a comment I hear frequently), then why do you want to be a screenwriter?
    - 1.   Avoid reviews, trailers, and previews. The best way to see a film is with as little knowledge as possible about what will happen, so you can fully experience whatever surprises and emotional peaks the writer intended. Save any reviews or publicity articles until after you see the movie, so you can enter the theater as receptive as possible.
    - 3.   See it the first time for fun. Don’t take notes, don’t read along with the script, and don’t even think about the screenplay when you first view a film. Ride the roller coaster the filmmaker created. You can figure out how the movie worked after it’s over.
    - 5.   Analyze your emotional reaction. Whenever you become engrossed in a film, ask yourself why. What kept you on the edge of your seat? Fascinating characters? Hilarity? Suspense? Big action? Sex? Romance? Sadness?

When you find yourself distanced from the story, determine the cause of that as well. Is it illogical? Too predictable? Repetitive? Boring? Why? And what would make it more emotionally involving?
    - Of the ninety-nine out of a hundred screenplays that can’t be recommended, ninety fall apart in one very basic way: the story concept sucks.
    - very story begins with the question What if . . . ?
    - What if everything we accept as real were actually a hallucination created by computers that have taken over the world? (The Matrix)
What if a boy discovered he was actually a wizard? (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone)
What if a newspaper tycoon’s mysterious dying word was investigated after his death? (Citizen Kane)
    - In the vast majority of Hollywood movies, the heroes aren’t simply pursuing something they want: the desires that define their stories are visible.
    - So when we learn that the hero’s goal in Monsters vs. Aliens is to unite with a group of monsters to defeat an alien invasion, we can easily imagine what that will look like on the screen
    - This visible finish line is what I term the hero’s outer motivation, because achieving it will be outwardly apparent to the audience, as opposed to invisible desires such as acceptance, belonging, revenge, and fulfillment. If I tell you my script is about a hero who wants to fulfill his destiny, you have no idea what is actually going to happen on the screen, or what success for my hero will look like.
    - As a screenwriter, you must accept this fact: if you want a career in screenwriting, you have to write movies and TV shows that people want to see. Otherwise you’re writing only for your own personal satisfaction, with no realistic career goals in mind.
