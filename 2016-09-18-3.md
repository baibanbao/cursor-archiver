- 现在的翻译是：
- ２０１０年时，美国国税局许可的纳税减免标准是：用于慈善事业的行驶里程税为每英里0.14美元（同时期用于商务活动的行驶里程税为每英里0.55美元）。从１９９７年美国《纳税人减税法》通过时的每英里0.12美元提高到这个标准后一直没有变过。
- 不合常理。
- 美国税务局的答复
- FAQ #1 – I donate time or services. How much can I deduct?
- You can not deduct the value of your time or services donated to a charity. Volunteers are often surprised about this. Of course, since the volunteer wasn’t paid for the services, they didn’t receive taxable income. No taxable income, no tax deduction – a simple, clean result.
- Yes, 14 cents per mile is silly
- Undoubtedly you’ve seen the regular updates from the IRS and other sources concerning deducting costs of use of a car. The Internal Revenue Code requires the IRS to adjust the business and medical mileage rates based on changes in costs of operating a vehicle. Beginning January 1, 2013, for example, you can deduct 56.5 cents per mile for business miles driven and 24 cents per mile driven for medical or moving purposes. The IRS based the standard mileage rate for business on an annual study of the fixed and variable costs of operating an automobile. The rate for medical and moving purposes is based on the variable costs as determined by the same study. The 14 cents is written right in the Internal Revenue Code (without language suggesting it be adjusted for inflation). See IRC Section 170(i) — which is part of the charitable deduction section of the Code. It hasn’t been changed in years. To get it changed, Congress will have to amend it — time to talk with your Congressperson.
