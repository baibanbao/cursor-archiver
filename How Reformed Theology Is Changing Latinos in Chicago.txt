Two years ago, my church nearly shut down.

We were an 8-year-old plant—CityLights Church—located in the Chicago community with the highest Latino population. Our lead pastor, who had left the Word of Faith church after being exposed to Reformed theology, had resigned after his emotional and spiritual life began to spiral.

两年前，我的教会几乎关闭。

我们是一个有8年历史的植堂教会--城市之光教会，位于芝加哥拉丁裔人口最多的社区。我们的主任牧师在接触了改革宗神学后，离开了属于成功神学的“信心宣告”（Word of Faith）运动，在感情上，在属灵上，开始走下坡路，最后辞职了。

Our congregation was left in disarray. Hurt, anger, and disillusionment were exacerbated by the bills piling up. Hurt and tired members left en masse—and I couldn’t blame them. As a bivocational elder who co-led the church, I was also exhausted and eyeing the door.

我们的会众陷入混乱。受伤、愤怒、幻灭，再加上堆积如山的账单，让一切每况愈下。倍感受伤和疲惫不堪的成员们集体离开，我也不能怪他们。作为一名双职长老和教会的共同领袖，我也筋疲力尽，眼看就要关门大吉。

To continue made no logical sense. We had two elders (including me), a pile of debt, and lots of decisions: should we sell the building, cut our losses, and go our separate ways? Should we merge with another church? Was it worth pressing on?

维持下去违犯常识和逻辑。包括我在内，我们有两位长老，一堆债务，还有很多主意要拿：是否应该卖掉建筑，减少损失，然后分道扬镳？是否应该与另一个教会合并？是否值得继续坚持下去？

Ultimately, we committed to bear the physical, emotional, and spiritual burden of revitalizing a dying church. Here’s why: there was no other church with a commitment to gospel centrality, urban missions, and Reformed theology in our predominantly Latino and impoverished community.

最终，我们承诺挑起重担，从外体、情感和灵性上，振兴我们这个奄奄一息的教会。原因是：在我们这个以拉丁裔为主的贫困社区，没有其他教会承诺以福音为中心，进行城市宣教和传播改革宗神学。

Reformed theology changed my life, and it changed my fellow church members. This is why we could not let our church die.

改革宗神学改变了我的生活，也改变了我们的教会成员。这就是为什么我们不能让我们的教会消亡。

Eliot: Personal Reformation

艾略特：个人的归正

I grew up in a multicultural Baptist church in one of the city’s deadliest neighborhoods in the early 2000 s. (It’s still deadly—in 2020,it was the hardest-hit with COVID in all of Illinois.) In my high school youth group, I first heard the five points of Calvinism. Conversations with my youth pastor sparked a study of Reformed theology that I would soon embrace, all while I was becoming more invigorated by urban ministry.

我在一个多元文化的浸信会教会中长大，我所在的社区在21世纪初是这个城市最危险的社区之一。(至今仍然是危险的，2020年，它是整个伊利诺伊州受 COVID 影响最严重的地方）。我在高中时参加青年团契，第一次听到加尔文主义五要点。随后，一位青年牧师与我谈话，引发了我对改革宗神学的兴趣，通过研究拥抱了这一神学主张，同时，我也更加振奋地投入到城市事工之中。

Reformed theology changed my life, and it changed my fellow church members.

改革宗神学改变了我的生活，也改变了我们的教会成员。

I saw gun violence, single-parent households, fathers in jail, homelessness. I wanted to see lives changed and biblical knowledge grow. When God called me to CityLights as the church was being planted, I saw the need for heart-transforming doctrines of grace being taught explicitly and boldly.

放眼社区，到处都是枪支暴力、单亲家庭、父亲坐牢、无家可归。我希望看到生命的改变和圣经知识的增长。当上帝呼召我到正在植堂的城市之光时，我看到，能改变人心的恩典教义需要明确和大胆地传讲和教导。

Many of those in CityLights had left the Word of Faith church. To help them, I went deeper into the Reformed faith. The Explicit Gospel by Matt Chandler showed me the corporate and cosmic implications of the gospel. John Piper’s The Pleasures of God helped me and others see the majesty and supremacy of God’s pleasure in all he does. The Gospel as Center, a collection of essays by members of The Gospel Coalition Council, showed me the centrality of the gospel for all of ministry and all of life. I adapted Wayne Grudem’s Systematic Theology to create our church’s first doctrine class. John Piper’s lecture series Gravity and Gladness shaped our understanding of corporate worship, and his poem The Calvinist gave me aspiration of the type of man I wanted to be.


城市之光中的许多人当初离开了信心宣告运动教会。为了帮助他们，我更深入地研究改革宗的信仰。马特·钱德勒的《明确的福音》让我看到了福音的团体和普世意义。约翰·派博的《神的喜悦》帮助我和其他人看到了神在他所做的一切中的威严和至上的喜悦。《以福音为中心》是福音联盟理事会成员的论文集，向我展示了福音在所有事工和所有生活中的中心地位。我改编了韦恩·格鲁德姆的《系统神学》，创建了我们教会的第一个教义课。约翰·派博的系列讲座《神在讲道中居首位》（Gravity and Gladness）塑造了我们对集体敬拜的理解，他的诗《加尔文主义者》让对自己想成为哪一类人有了期望。

Reformed theology had changed me. But just as powerfully, I had seen Reformed theology shape our church members.

改革宗神学改变了我。但同样有力的是，我看到改革宗神学塑造了我们的教会成员。

Alex and Maria: Suffering Under God’s Sovereign Hand

亚历克斯和玛丽亚：在上帝的主权之手下受苦

One church member who has been changed by Reformed theology is Alex Diaz. He was led to the Lord by a faithful brother who invited him to a predominantly Latino  v     in Chicago. Alex was mentored there and eventually became a pastor. But through his careful study of Scripture, he realized the false teaching of the church. He knew he had missional zeal but lacked theological proficiency.

一位被改革宗神学改变的教会成员是亚历克斯·迪亚兹。他被一位忠心的弟兄引领到主面前，这位弟兄邀请他到芝加哥一个以拉丁裔为主的“信心宣告”教会。亚历克斯在那里得到了指导，最终成为一名牧师。但通过对圣经的仔细研究，他意识到教会的错误教导 。他知道自己有传教的热情，但对神学并不精通。

Alex is married to Maria, who was saved from an abusive relationship that produced two children by the time she was 17. The two started to wrestle with the conflict between the truth of the Scriptures and what was being taught or lived by the pastor.

亚历克斯与玛丽亚结婚，玛丽亚之前经历过一段虐待关系，17岁时就生了两个孩子，后来获救。两人开始纠结于圣经的真理和牧师的言传身教之间的冲突。

A CityLights pastor referred Alex to podcasts and books on Reformed theology. They transformed his thinking, eventually leading him to join our congregation. For Alex, a Chicago firefighter facing early retirement due to stage-four cancer diagnosis, it was God’s sovereignty that gave him hope. Alex and Maria now both consider Alex’s cancer a gift from a loving and gracious God who, although allowing cancer to take so much from their lives, gave them a far better blessing: seeing and savoring Christ all the more.

城市之光的一位牧师向亚历克斯介绍了改革宗神学的播客和书籍。这些书改变了他的思想，最终使他成为我们会众中的一员。亚历克斯是芝加哥的一名消防员，因被诊断出癌症第四期而面临提前退休，是上帝的大能大力给了他希望。亚历克斯和玛丽亚现在都认为，亚历克斯的癌症是一位充满爱心和恩典的上帝所赐的礼物，虽然上帝允许癌症从他们的生活中夺走那么多东西，却给了他们更美好的祝福：更多地看到和品尝基督。

Through cancer diagnoses, COVID-related trauma, anxiety and depression, and even the loss of children, resting in the sovereignty of God has encouraged our members to “kiss the wave” that threw us against the Rock of Ages. Trials and trauma can find their proper place in our minds under our grasp of God’s sovereignty in all things.

我们的成员尽管经历了癌症确诊、与 COVID 有关的创伤、焦虑和抑郁，甚至丧子之痛，却依然安息在上帝的主权里，这激励着大家去残生一线对惊涛，不惧怕那些将我们抛向古老巉岩的巨浪。在万事中对神的主权有把握，就能摆正试炼和创伤在我们心中的位置。


David: Electing Love

大卫：蒙爱被拣选

A common theme that comes up in counseling meetings is the baggage of abandonment or abuse. Our members can tell story after story of growing up without fathers or mothers, or of being sexually abused as a child by a relative. These traumas often result in deep-seated resentment toward parental figures and a difficulty in grasping God as Father.

在圣经辅导聚会上，经常出现的一个主题是被遗弃或虐待的包袱。我们的成员可以讲述一个又一个在成长过程中缺父少母的故事，或者在童年时被亲戚性侵的悲剧。这些创伤往往导致人们对父母根深蒂固的怨恨，难以理解为什么说上帝是天上的父亲。

Take David Diaz, for instance. David was born in Honduras and raised in the church. When he was 8, his father showed up drunk and belligerent at the women’s prayer meeting in his mother’s home. After the women prayed for him, David’s father walked him to the door, hugged him, said he loved him, and told him goodbye. David would not see his father for another decade.

就拿大卫·迪亚兹来说吧。大卫出生在洪都拉斯，在教会中长大。在他8岁那年，母亲正在家里举办姊妹祷告会，这时他醉熏熏的父亲出现了，一副来势汹汹的样子。妇女们一起为这个醉汉祷告，醉汉陪大卫走到门口，拥抱他，说了很多“心肝宝贝我爱你”之类的话，最后说再见。从那以后，整整十年，大卫再也没有见过他的父亲。

For years, David struggled with his father’s abandonment and wondered if he had something to do with it. Was he not happy with me? He carried these unsettled and unanswered questions with him as he grew in his Christian walk.

多年以来，一想到父亲抛家舍业这件事，大卫就跟自己较劲：是不是因为自己做错了什么？是不是因为父亲跟自己在一起不开心？当他踏上天路历程的时候，这些悬而未决的问题一直伴随着他。

David was exposed to Reformed theology by a godly man who took the time to explain the doctrines of grace. To David, election seemed unfair.“This is not the God I serve,” he’d say.

大卫接触到了改革宗神学，一位虔敬的弟兄花时间向他解释恩典的教义。对大卫来说，拣选似乎很不公平。他说："这不是我所侍奉的上帝"。

Yet through studying and discussing these truths, David saw not only a just God who would do whatever he pleases, but a loving heavenly Father who reached down and chose him—a totally depraved, sin-cursed man. David’s earthly father rejected him, despite David’s efforts to “choose” his father. Now he embraced the truth of a heavenly Father who not only accepted him, but elected him despite anything he had done, good or bad.

然而，通过学习和研讨这些真理，大卫不仅看到了一位“要怜悯谁就怜悯谁，要恩待谁就恩待谁”的公义的上帝，而且看到了一位慈爱的天父，他伸手拣选了他--一个全然堕落、被罪咒诅的人。尽管大卫努力"选择"他地上的父亲，还是被拒绝。现在他接受关于天父的真理。不管他做过什么，好事还是坏事，天父都不仅接纳了他，而且拣选了他。

The truth of election helped David with his hurt and grief toward his earthly father, enabling him not only to forgive but to build a relationship with him. David, who’d been involved in leading worship since he was 7 in Honduras, ended up coming to CityLights while looking for a Reformed church with passionate worship. Eventually, he became one of our elders.

拣选的真理帮助大卫解决了他地上的父亲带给他的伤害和苦痛，使他不仅能够原谅他，而且能够与他建立起关系。大卫从7岁开始就在洪都拉斯参与带领敬拜，在寻找大发热心的改革宗教会时来到了城市之光教会。最后，他成为我们的长老之一。

In that first year after our church suffered the sadness of losing our lead pastor, David preached on Romans 9, declaring to a still-struggling church the glory of God in choosing ill-deserving sinners for himself. Although we may feel abandoned, we are never forsaken by our gracious Father.

在我们教会因失去了主任牧师而笼罩在愁云残雾中的第一年，大卫为我们证道，讲解《罗马书》第9章，向仍在挣扎的教会宣告了上帝的荣耀，着荣耀是通过为他自己拣选那些不配的罪人而彰显的。虽然我们可能有被遗弃的感觉，但我们仁慈的天父从未撇下我们。

Eliezer: Persevering Saints

埃利泽：圣徒永蒙保守

Being in a Reformed church with a large constituency of former Pentecostals presents unique opportunities (such as passion in corporate worship) along with unique challenges (such as legalism). One of our responsibilities is helping our members understand that their stance before God is not dependent on their work, but on Christ’s alone.

一所改革宗教会里，拥有大量从五旬节派归正的信徒，既是独特的机会（如团体敬拜中激情四溢），也是独特的挑战（如律法主义）。我们的责任之一是帮助成员们明白，他们在神面前的地位并不取决于他们的善工，而只取决于基督的工作。

Eliezer Mercado grew up in a legalistic Pentecostal church in which men were unable to grow beards, women had to wear skirts, and your salvation depended on strict adherence to denominational tradition and Christian practices. If you didn’t attend church faithfully or read your Bible regularly, your salvation was in doubt. Eliezer ended up marrying the senior pastor’s daughter and became his heir apparent.

埃利泽·梅尔卡多在一个律法主义盛行的五旬节派教会中长大，在那里，男人不能留胡子，女人必须穿裙子，你的救赎取决于对教派传统和基督教习俗的严格遵守。如果你不尽忠去教会，不经常读圣经，你的得救就会受到怀疑。埃利泽与高级牧师的女儿结婚，继承他的衣钵。

One day, Eliezer heard a Baptist preacher on the radio. He began tuning in regularly, and his interest was sparked. Soon he began to question his church’s dogma—why did members never hear about struggling with sin? Why did they have to keep asking for manifestations of the Holy Spirit? Why were manmade traditions requirements for salvation? Why was the gospel rarely preached?

有一天，埃利泽在广播中听到一位浸信会布道家，他开始定期收听，兴趣被激发起来。很快，他开始质疑自己教会的成规教条—为什么成员们从未听说过与罪争战？为什么他们必须不断要求圣灵显现和充满？为什么人为的传统变成了救恩的条件？为什么福音很少被宣扬？

Eliezer enrolled at Trinity International University, where he was exposed to the doctrines of grace. Little by little, he began to approach his father-in-law to show him the Bible’s teaching on salvation by grace alone.“We don’t teach that here” was the response.

埃利泽进入了三一国际大学，在那里接触到了恩典的教义。渐渐地，他开始向岳父展示圣经中关于唯独靠恩典得救的教导。岳父的回答是：“我们这里不教这个”。

But Eliezer couldn’t stay quiet. He began to teach his extended family, who were in his church. Their thinking was revolutionized. As they wrestled with the doctrines of grace together, trying to reconcile what they had been taught, they began to understand the freedom found in Christ.

但埃利泽不能保持沉默。他开始教导自己的大家庭，这些人都在他的教会里。他们的思想被彻底改变。当他们一起在恩典的教义上心乱如麻，试图调和他们以前所受的教导时，他们开始理解在基督里找到的释放和自由。

弟兄查经班/艾略特·维拉兹克斯提供

There was freedom in not having to earn your salvation. There was freedom from the fear of God constantly turning his face from them in their sin struggles, to say confidently with the catechism,“I am not my own, but belong—body and soul, in life and in death—to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ. He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood, and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.” There was freedom to trust in the imputed righteousness of Christ alone to secure salvation, not in denominational decrees or traditions nor in the constant repetition of the “sinner’s prayer.”

这自由体现在：救恩不用自己赚取。这自由体现在：信徒在与罪的征战的时候，不用再害怕上帝不断地转过脸去，掩面不看自己。这自由体现在：可以确信教理问答中的字句：”我今生无论生，无论死，身体灵魂，皆非自己所有，乃是属于我信实的救主耶稣基督。他已经用宝血完全偿还了我所有的罪债，并把我从魔鬼的权势中救拔出来，获得自由”。这自由还体现在：因信称义，信靠唯独基督的归义才是得救的保障，而不是信靠教派的规条或传统，更不是信靠需要不断重复的"罪人的祷告"。

As their theology grew, Eliezer and his extended family made the difficult and painful decision to leave their church. After searching for churches listed on The Gospel Coalition website, they found CityLights.

随着在神学的精进，埃利泽和他的大家庭做出了艰难而痛苦的决定，离开他们原先的教会。在搜索了福音联盟网站上所列的教会后，他们找到了城市之光。

As a pastor, nothing brings me more shepherding joy than to see believers like Eliezer and his family, who had been bound to the “performance treadmill,” lifting their voices to sing:

作为一名牧师，没有什么比看到像埃利泽和他的家人这样被束缚在"业绩跑步机"上的信徒举起嗓子唱歌更能带给我牧者的喜悦了。

作为一名牧师，没有别的牧养的喜乐能与此刻相比，埃利泽和他的家人，曾被束缚在“靠行为得救”的信条上，如今却扬声高唱：

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life’s first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from his hand
Till he returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand


活着没有负罪，死时没有惧怕
这就是基督的力量在我身上显大
从生命的第一声啼哭到最后一口气
耶稣决定我的归宿

没有地狱的力量，没有人的谋划
能把我从他手中夺走
直到他回来或召唤我回家
我都站立在在基督的力量之中


Orlando: TULIP-Driven Mission

奥兰多：郁金香五要点驱动的宣教

J. A. Medders writes that Reformed theology “is meant for more than theological headiness; it is meant for mission.” It was zeal for the glory of God, love for good robust theology, and a heart for God’s people that brought Orlando Munoz, one of our elders, to our church.

门德斯（J. A. Medders）写道，改革宗神学"不仅仅是为了占领神学上的高地，而是为了宣教"。正是对神的荣耀的热忱、对良好稳健神学的热爱以及对神的子民的爱心，将我们的长老之一奥兰多·穆诺斯带到了我们教会。

After a night of drinking, Orlando first ended up at a Word of Faith church to check out some ladies. Through his study of the Scriptures, he butted heads with the pastor over theology. He ended up leaving for Texas and joining a church plant.

经过一夜宿醉，奥兰多进了一间信仰宣告教会，目的是为了打探几位女士。通过深入查考圣经，他与牧师在神学上产生分歧。最后他选择离开，前往德州，加入了一间植堂的教会。


His Australian-born pastor turned him on to the writings of Martyn Lloyd-Jones, which led him to J. I. Packer, Andrew Murray, and John MacArthur. As his theology grew, his heart for his friends back in his Word of Faith church compelled him to return. He started a Bible study that turned into a church, which would end up merging with CityLights in 2019.

他的牧师出生于澳大利亚，介绍他接触了马丁·劳埃·琼斯的著作，这使他认识了巴刻、安德鲁·慕丽和约翰·麦克阿瑟。随着在神学上成长，出于对信仰宣告教会里的朋友们的爱，他被迫回归。他发起了一个查经班，后来变成了一间教会，最终于2019年与城市之光合并。

Pressing on for the City

为城市的发展而努力

In our predominately Latino congregation, we have seen the effect of Reformed theology on adults who’d been abused as children, marriages that were on the brink of divorce, and families who didn’t know where the next paycheck would come from. And it was Reformed theology that spurred us as church leaders to press on, get to work, prioritize the teaching of solid biblical doctrine, and be a part of God’s work in our community.


在我们这个以拉丁裔为主的教会中，我们看到了改革宗神学对那些小时候受虐待的成年人、濒临离婚的婚姻、以及不知道下一份薪水从何而来的家庭的影响。正是归正神学促使我们这些教会领袖继续努力，开始工作，把教导坚实纯正的圣经教义放到首位，积极参与上帝在我们共同体中的做工。

为邻里祈祷/艾略特·维拉兹克斯提供

We understand that God is sovereign in all things, including the trials we went through during our leadership transition, COVID, and the individual trials in the lives of our members. We understand that ultimately it is in God that we live and move and have our existence (Acts 17:28), and that he is sovereign over every human heart, head, and hands (Prov.16:9;Isa.46:9–10).

我们明白，神在所有事务上都有主权，包括我们在领导层过渡期间所经历的考验，COVID瘟疫，以及我们成员生活中的个人考验。我们明白，我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎上帝（使徒行传17:28），他对每个人的心、脑、手都有主权（箴16:9；赛46:9-10）。

Our belief in total depravity helped us wrestle not only with the sins we had committed, but the sins committed against us. And we recognized that ultimately, prosperity-gospel preachers promise health and wealth without ever dealing with the problem of sin that permeates every iota of our being. The only solution to the fallenness of our neighborhood is the gospel of Jesus Christ. It’s a solution our community desperately needs.

对全然堕落教义的笃信不仅帮助我们与自己犯下的罪相争，还与那些针对我们所犯的罪相争。我们认识到，成功神学的布道者们许诺健康和财富，但没有处理渗透在我们每个人身上的罪的问题。解决我们社区堕落问题的唯一办法是耶稣基督的福音。这是我们社区迫切需要的解决方案。


The only solution to the fallenness of our neighborhood is the gospel of Jesus Christ.

解决我们社区堕落问题的唯一办法是耶稣基督的福音。

Unconditional election reminded us that God is not hindered by someone’s faulty theological upbringing or poor socioeconomic status. In Chicago, one of the most segregated cities in America, God holds no prejudice.

无条件拣选提醒我们，错误的神学教导和贫困的社会经济地位，都无法组党神。在芝加哥这个美国种族隔离最严重的城市，上帝并不偏待人。

We trusted that because of definite atonement, Christ fully and actually saved sinners in our church and turned them into saints. No matter what church tradition or denominational dogma taught our church members, because of our faith in the finished work of Christ, we can know that God chose us and gave us the gift of saving faith.

我们相信，由于限定性救赎，基督完全地、实际地拯救了我们教会中的罪人，并使他们成为圣徒。无论我们的教会成员受过何种教会传统或宗派教条的教训，因为对基督已经成了的救赎工作的信心，我们可以知道，上帝拣选了我们，并赐给我们得救的信心。

As we pressed on through our church’s hurt, financial disarray, and a global pandemic, we could rest knowing that God’s irresistible grace means our work in our church and community would never be in vain (1 Cor.15:58). We recognized that God’s prophets had been constantly rejected by the people, yet were faithful to what God called them to do. And so we would commit to the work of ministry and teaching the Reformed faith, even if it meant the rejection of family and friends as a result of our doctrinal beliefs. Because of God’s irresistible grace, we can plant and water knowing that God is the decisive cause of growth (1 Cor.3:5–7).


当我们一面经历教会内的伤害、财政困难和全球大流行，一面奋力前行时，我们可以知道，神不可抗拒的恩典意味着我们在教会和共同体中的工作，我们的劳苦在主里面不是徒然的（林前15:58）。我们认识到，神的众先知一直被人们弃绝，却在神召唤他们所做的事情上尽忠。因此，我们将致力于事奉和教导归正信仰的工作，即使这意味着家人和朋友会因为我们的教义信仰而弃绝我们。由于上帝不可抗拒的恩典，我们可以栽种和浇灌，知道上帝是让他们生长的决定性原因（林前3:5-7）。

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we could rejoice knowing that God would ultimately persevere through the saints at CityLights, despite the spiritual and theological baggage we brought. We’d been knocked down, but we’d get back up. We could be struck down, but we would never be destroyed (2 Cor.4:8–10). God would see to it that we would persevere to the end, holy and blameless before him (1 Thess.5:23–24).

最后，也许是最重要的，我们可以欣喜地知道，尽管我们带着属灵和神学上的负担，但神最终会通过城市之光圣徒们坚持下去。我们四面受敌，却不被困住；心里作难，却不至于失望；遭逼迫，却不被丢弃；打倒了，却不至死亡（林后4:8-10）。神会看着我们坚忍到底，在他面前完全无可指摘（帖前5：23-24）。
