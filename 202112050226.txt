致贾斯图斯·约拿斯**1 **维滕贝格，约1527年11月10日]**2**

在这封信的前半部分，路德表达了因伊拉斯谟和圣餐派对他的猛烈攻击而感到的悲痛，并沉思这对他的意义。然后他报告了维滕贝格的瘟疫造成的状况：他为妻子担心，因为她很快就要生第二个孩子了；他讲述了他儿子约翰的病；他还提到了他收留的一些朋友。他报告了克里斯蒂安-戈德施密特的一些事务，并提到他希望完成《传道书》的工作。

在主耶稣、我们的救主里面的恩典和平安！

我感谢你，我的约拿斯，你为我们祈祷，偶尔给我们写封信。我相信我昨天发出的信**3**已经到达你那里了。

我还没有读过伊拉斯谟**4**和圣餐派**5**的书，除了茨温利的三册书。**6**这些人瞧不起我是对的，我这个可怜人，追随了犹大的榜样。他们还迫使我与基督一起哀叹。"因为他……逼迫困苦穷乏的，和伤心的人，要把他们治死。"**7**我因为犯罪得罪了神，而承受神的愤怒。**8** 教皇和皇帝，君主和主教，以及整个世界都恨我，攻击我；这还不够，连我的弟兄也折磨我，以致我的罪、 死亡、以及撒旦和它的众天使不停地发怒**9**。如果基督也抛弃我，那么还有什么可以拯救和安慰我呢？为基督的缘故，他们都痛恨我。但直到最后，基督也不会抛弃我这个最可怜的罪人，因为我自认为是人群中最渺小的。**10** 哦，上帝会同意--我再说一遍，哦，上帝会同意--伊拉斯谟和
圣餐派能体验我内心的痛苦哪怕一刻钟！那么我将会宣布他们是真正的悔改和被治愈了。 现在我的敌人强大而活跃，他们甚至在悲痛上加伤悲痛，**11** 逼迫上帝所击打的人。**12**但这就够了，以免我口发怨言，对上帝的杖不耐烦，因为他既打又治，既杀又活，**13** 祂圣洁完美的旨意里是值得赞美的。世界和它的统治者**14**如此痛恨的人，不可能不为基督所喜。如果我们是属于世界的，世界就会爱自己的人。**15**

我担心我妻子的分娩，**16**执事妻子的例子使我大为害怕。**17**但那大能的主为我做了大事，**18**所以也要我忍耐大事。但愿我纯正传讲和口里承认的基督，成为我的磐石和堡垒。阿门。

我的小约翰现在因病不能向你问候，**19**但他希望你为他祈祷。他停止正常饮食已经12天了，**20** 期间一直是靠流质食物维持生命。现在他终于有了一点胃口。看到这个婴儿渴望像往常一样快乐和强壮，实在太好了，但是他还做不到，因为太虚弱了。

昨天玛格丽特·冯·莫考做了脓肿手术。**21** 由于脓液已经排干，**22** 她开始感觉好多了。我把她限定在我们通常的冬季暖房里居住，而我们则是住在大前厅里。 汉臣 **23** 住在我的卧室，而奥古斯丁[舒尔夫] **24** 的妻子住了他的卧室。**25** 我们希望瘟疫能够结束。**26** 再见了，给你的儿子捎去[我的]一个吻，**27** 并拥抱他的母亲 **28**，请在你的祷告中常常提起我们。

写几条新闻。**29** 我看到了克里斯蒂·戈德施密特夫人**30** 的弟弟--那个年轻人写的信。他在信中说，如果双方的[亲属]同意，他将与多萝西·法尔肯**31**订婚，以稳定而真实的婚姻为目的，并请他的姐姐和克里斯蒂安提供建议和帮助。我不知道在这种情况下应该怎么做。你可以把这个消息告诉他姐姐，**32** 作为一条新闻。
 
我不希望罗马被焚毁，因为那将是一个巨大的恶行。**33** 我希望我们能再次生活在一处，**34**并能在我们死之前，出版我们关于《传道书》的作品。**35** 在你们的祷告中记住我。克里斯蒂安和他的家人已经搬到了柏林，**36** 但侯爵约阿希姆一世**37**在同一天以瘟疫的危险为借口，命令他离开他的整个领地。看哪，撒旦和人的邪恶! 因此，我们维滕贝格人是所有人憎恨、厌恶和恐惧的对象，正如诗篇所说，凡看见我的都嗤笑我他们撇嘴摇头 **38**，但（我们希望）是天使和圣徒的 “冠冕和喜乐 ” **39**。阿门。

马丁·路德，基督的尘土 **40**

Today is the twelfth day that he has eaten nothing, 20  he has been somehow sustained only by liquids. Now he is beginning to eat a little bit. It is wonderful to see how this infant wants to be happy and strong as usual, but he cannot because he is too weak.

Yesterday the abscess of Margaret von Mochau was operated on. 21 Since the pus has drained away, 22  she is beginning to feel better. I have confined her in our usual winter room, while we are
living in the big front hall.  Hänschen 23 is staying in my bedroom while the wife of Augustine [Schurf] 24 is staying in his. 25  We hope for the end of the plague. 26  Farewell, and give a kiss to your son 27
and a hug to his mother 28  [from mel, and remember us in your prayers.

To write some news, 29  I have seen the letter which the young man, the brother of Mrs. Christian Goldschmidt, so has written. In this letter he states that he is engaged to Dorothy Falkensi for a stable and true marriage, if [the relatives] on both sides give their permission, and asks his sister and Christian for advice and help. I do not know what should be done in this case. You can tell thisto his sister,32 as a certain piece of news. 
 
I do not want Rome to be burned, for that would be a great monstrosity. 33  I wish that we could live together again, 34 and could publish our work on Ecclesiastes before we die. 35  Remember me in your prayers. Christian and his family had moved to Berlin, 36  but Margrave Joachimst ordered him out of his whole territory on the same day, under the pretext of the danger of the plague. Behold the wickedness of Satan and men! Thus we Wittenbergers are the object of hate, disgust, and fear of all, as the Psalmist says: A reproach of men and despised by the people, 38, but (we hope)   “the crown and joy" 39 of angels and saints. Amen. 

Martin LUTHER, dirt for Christ's sake 40


20 This statement supplies information for establishing the date of this letter. In a letter to von Amsdorf written on November 1, Luther mentioned that John had been ill for three days; WA, Br 4, 275.On November 4 Luther reported to Jonas that John had been ill for eight days(WA,Br 4.276),and on November 7. he said that John had now been in for over eight days;WA Br 4.277. According to these dates, John became sick on about October 28 ot29. In the present letter to Jonas Luther mentions that John has been ill for twelve days, which would date this letter November 9 or 10. This raises thy question of the no-longer extant letter to Jonas, mentioned at the beginning g this letter. Luther says that he had sent a letter"yesterday. The wa, B editor argues that this letter is no longer extant; so does Rückert, LB,p.216 n. 18. Enders does not deal with the matter at all. L. de Wette(Dr.Martin Luthers Briefe, Sendschreiben und Bedenken [Berlin, 1827] 3,220) suggests that the letter which Luther says he sent "yesterday" might be the one of November 4(WA,Br4,No. 1165). This suggestion jeopardizes the a proximate date established for this present letter (ca. November 10), as de Wette pointed out. This need not be the case, however, if one considers that Luther could very well have written to Jonas on November 4, but-in view of the plague situation-could not send off the letter until "yesterday, i.e, ca. November 9. Another possibility would be to assume that Luther's memory tricked him-a good possibility-and that "yesterday" is not to be taken literally In the opinion of this editor, the letter to Jonas mentioned by Luther at the beginning of this letter of ca. November 1o is the one of November 4(WA Br 4,No. 1165). A comparison of the content of the letters of November 4 and that of ca. November 10 could substantiate this assumption in more detail See also note 29.

21 Margaret von Mochau was a sister-in-law of Andrew Karlstadt (see LW 4879,n.12); see H. Barge, Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt (2nd ed; Nieuw. koop, 1968),2,18,n.38; 1,364. She was taken in by the Luther family when the plague became increasingly severe.

22 Literally: “pure pestilence having been drained away."

23 I.e, John Luther. This word is written in German. See also p. 323,n. 7.

24 Anne, the daughter of the mayor of Torgau, Matthew Moschwitz, was married to Augustine Schurf in approximately 1522. Augustine Schurf(the brother of Jerome Schurf;see LW 48,219,n.2)had been teaching medicine in Wittenberg since 1521, and performed the first dissection of a human head at Wittenberg University. On Augustine Schurf, see ARG 7(1909/10),360 f25 On the rooms of the Luther house (which was the former Augustinian monastery),see ARG 17(1920),301 ff. Notwithstanding the danger involved the Luthers took in people during this plague epidemic, even if they were sick, so that Luther said his home was beginning to be a hospital; WA, Br 4275. In addition to the people mentioned here, the Bugenhagens had moved in after November 2, having been greatly shocked by the dramatic passing of George Rörer's wife, who had died in the Bugenhagen home; wA, Br 4, 276

21 It finally came. On November 22 Luther reported that the plague had disappeared; see WA, Br 4, 284. This seems to have been a somewhat overly optimistic statement; see WA, Br 4,287(November 29),288(December 13) But by December 10, the situation seems definitely to have improved; see WA,Br 4, 294.-It is diflicult to say much about the plague epidemic without going into great medical details. The bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic forms of the plague, the forms in which the plague occurred during the later Middle Ages and the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were highly contagious, and were accompanied by a high rate of mortality caused by a com- bination of intense fever, swellings, abscesses, and even paralysis. The plague broke out in Wittenberg in the summer of 1527. On August 15 the University was evacuated to jena, and from there to Schlieben, near Wittenberg. It did not return to Wittenberg until April of 1528. See Urkundenbuch, Nos. 151-155; Kostlin-Kawerau 2, 171. Luther and his family and Bugenhagen(the city pastor) and his family remained in the plague-infested city (on the plague in Wittenberg, see also G. Buchwald, Zur Wittenberger Stadt- und Universitäts- Geschichte in der Reformationszeit [Leipzig,1893], pp.3 ff.), even though Luther himself was physically weak and had been urged by the Elector on August 10 to leave the city; wa, Br 4, No. 1127; S-J2, No. 769. With both word and deed Luther ministered to the sick; he assisted the city council; he lectured (see p. 181) to a small group of students who for unknown reasons had not left town; and he wrote his beautiful long pastoral letter addressed to John Hess in Breslau(see LW 48, 143,n. 5),which is entitled: Whether One May Flee From a Deadly Plague; WA 23,338 ff; LW 43,113 ff. Luther's actions during these months of danger and distress, together with this treatise give some of the strongest testimony of Luther's understanding of the respon-sibilities a pastor has toward his fock, and a Christian toward his brother. Some scholars have argued that during these weeks of the plague, in which also the tenth "anniversary" of the posting of The Ninety-five Theses fell, Luther composed his A Mighty Fortress is Our God; see Enders, Briefwechsel6,112,n. 9. There are indeed striking similarities between the hymn and Luther's life and work in the plague-infested city. See, however, Luther 19(1937),4fF;PE 6,306;LW 53,283 f

27 The text incorrectly reads filiam, i.e. daughter. lonas had only a son, Justus, who was born on December 3.1525;see WA,Br 3,630n.1.Justus, who later brought much grief to his father (see EndersBriefwechsel 7.302 n.4)，was the second-born. A first-born son, John, died in the summer of 1527; see WA Br 4, 232 (dated August 19); Kawerau, Jonas Briefwechsel 1, No. 102.

28 On February 9, 1522, Jonas had married a certain Catherine Falcke (om Falck, or Falk), who died in 1542; see Enders, Briefwechsel 4, 98, n. 6; WA, Br 8,446,n. 1.

29 Luther apparently felt the information which he had communicated thus far was not "news,because in his November 4 letter to Jonas(WA, Br 4, No. 1165) he had told jonas much of what he tells in this present letter. A closer examination of both letters could substantiate the argument that in the letter of ca. November 10, Luther brings Jonas up to date by continuing to report on those events which he had mentioned for the first time on No. vember 4.

30 The wife of Christian Düring (see LW 48,42,n. 8),or Goldschmidt, was a certain Barbara Blankenfeld. She was a grand-daughter of Thomas Blanken- feld, who had been mayor of Berlin several times. see wa, Br 3,514,n. 4, and WA, Br 13, 74 ad loc., 4, 280, n. 22. Apparently she had a brother, who had written to the Goldschmidts, and Luther had seen this no-longer extant letter. This brother could be identical with John Blankenfeld of Berlin, who had matriculated in Wittenberg in 1516; see WA, Br 4, 280, n. 22.

31 A certain Caspar Falk, or Falcke, was a brother-in-law of Jonas; WA, Br 8,446,n. 1. Did Dorothy Falken have any relation to this Caspar Falk and thus to Jonas?

32 The text does not make clear whose sister this was supposed to be; one can assume, however, that it was another sister of John Blankenfeld, who indeed had at least two more sisters; see WA, Br 3, 514, n. 4 and wA, Br 13, 74, ad loc. But did any one of them live in Nordhausen, where Jonas lived at that time? Or does one have to think of a sister of Christian Goldschmidt?

33 See p. 169. This passage could also be translated: "... for that would be a momentous omen." But "omen" of what? The answer closest at hand would be that "omen" was intended to be connected with God's judgment over the world, and thus with the end of this world. According to WA, Br 4,223,n.4, the author of a contemporary pamphlet (not available to this editor) saw in the sack of Rome God's judgment over the papacy.

34 In the middle of August lonas and his family had gone to Nordhausen to escape the plague and also to take care of some private matters. See wa Br 4, 232, 268. Jonas stayed there till the end of January, 1528. See Kawerau Jonas Briefwechsel 1, Nos. 107,121,122.

35 In the summer and fall of 1526 Luther had lectured on Ecclesiastes; WA Br 4, 110, 122. These lectures were not published until 1532, and then were published by some of Luther's friends (and only on the basis of students notes);WA, 20, 1 ff. It is not clear what role Jonas (who was living in Nord- hausen) was to play in this project. Was he to be the editor? Was he to supply a German translation? Had Luther discussed this translation with him? The latter possibility seems logical, since Jonas did indeed publish, in 1533, a German translation of these lectures; see WA 20, 4. 

36 The aunt of Christian During's wife (see note 30),Catherine Hornung, lived in Berlin as a mistress of Margrave joachim I; see wa, Br 4, No. 1179,Introduction. See also p. 326, n. 1l. 

37 Margrave Joachim i, elector of Brandenburg and one of Luther's earliest foes, afraid that the plague would be brought to his territory, expelled the Dürings. Luther interpreted this as an act of hostility toward his city of Wittenberg. 

38 Ps. 22:7.

39 Phil.4:1

40 Literally:“Christ's mud." For “dirt" Luther wrote lutum, and this was obviously a pun on his name
