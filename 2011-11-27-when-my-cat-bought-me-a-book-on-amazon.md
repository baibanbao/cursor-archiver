- My complaint letter to amazon.com
- Dear sir:
- Something sound incredible but did happen. On Nov. 22, my cat bought a book for me accidentally! The transaction number is (D01-4023066-98*********) and my Amazon id is w***********@gmail.com
- I read the sample of The Song of The Dodo on my Kindle DXG and reached the last page when I walked away. At the very moment, my cat jumped to my desk and put his paws on the kindle. The next day I found that the whole book had been downloaded to my device. The purchase could not be made either by me or by my wife, as I had no intention to buy this book and no one else use my kindle under my roof. The only reasonable suspect is the cat! I know it sounds crazy but I am telling the truth.
- I wonder if you could kindly refund me for this accidental purchase? I promise I will delete The Song of The Dodo from all my devices and never read the full version until I buy it voluntarily.
- Thank you for your attention.
- Yours Sincerely
- A customer from China
- Ten hours later, I got an e-mail from amazon.
- The Reply from Amazon.com
- Hello,
- I understand that you have purchased "The Song of the Dodo" accidentally and want to refund for this order. As a goodwill gesture, I've requested a refund of $14.99 for "The Song of the Dodo." If the item is still on your Kindle (or a Kindle-compatible device), please delete that copy. After the refund is issued, you will no longer be able to access this item.
- Refunds are issued to the payment method used to make the original purchase and usually complete within two to three business days.
- You can also cancel accidental purchases yourself for a short time after the order is placed. Simply select the "Purchased by Accident? Cancel this Order" option on the order confirmation page displayed on your Kindle. You can also sample many Kindle books for free by clicking the "Send sample now" button when shopping in the Kindle Store. We'll send an excerpt to your Kindle wirelessly or you can also view them on any Kindle application.
- I hope this helps. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
