Watching football in the rain 🌧️.

Full script

Foreign [Music]. I was sitting in the rain the other day getting soaked, watching those football players play. My team was losing, so it wasn't even funny. An old dumb me I bet all my rent money. I got so shook I could hardly even talk. So I got my base and we went for a walk. We started walking [Music].

The speaker and their base go on a walking adventure despite financial struggles and a drinking problem 🚶‍♂️🎶💰🍺.

Full script

Now, the base and I, we got a good thing going. We can stand on the corner and see what legs are showing. Some of the girls will walk by, don't like the look of my face. But every last one says: can I pluck that face? And I say, ah, no, you just keep walking. Foreign [Music]. We must have walked about a mile or more. I started to get tired. My feet were getting sore. So I said: base, we've walked pretty far, let's go have a taste in this Soulful looking bar. So we walked in order too. And the bartender, he's standing there like he doesn't know what to do. So I said: hey, man, why they blank? Look on your face. He said: first time in my life I've ever seen a drinking base. Let's go walking. [music]. We had, oh, round after round. Finally I got. So I thought my insides would drown. I mean, every time I looked down I saw them shake like jelly and Kendrick. As much as this base. It's got a much bigger belly. So I said: the base, after we get these last two down, let's make ourselves Homeward Bound. And we tried the walk, but [Applause], in the middle of the thyroid problem, I mean I was seeing double the base that is. By the time we got home I'd straightened up. So I walked into my house and said, hi, buttercup. She said: aha, JC, I can tell by that. Look on your face. You've been out drinking again, you and that old drunken base now. Now we don't have any money and we can't pay the rent. And where are we gonna sleep? Are we gonna sleep in that old tent? And I said you jam, get out of my, I don't need you, I've got my base. Let's go walking. [music]- foreign [Music].

Save money, buy a bass 🎸.

Full script

So if you've got domestic problems or whatever may be the case, just save a little money and go buy a base. And when your mate starts that nagging talking, you can just grab your raincoat, take your base and go walking. You might say: spend all that money. It's only made of wood, but you can tell by its shape: it must be some kind of good. Let's go walking. [music]. [applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music].
