    - I said: What this play is about is that you must be willing to risk everything you have in order to get what you want. And I wrote that down and put it above the typewriter, and everything that didn’t apply to that in some way went bye-bye.

    - Try to figure out what your subconscious is telling you. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=591))
    - It’s a constant uncovering and revealing process. ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=599))
    - A good play to me is a play that challenges an audience’s assumptions. It says: “You think you know something about this, but I’m going to show you something else. I have other ideas about it.” ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=621))
    - A great play—how many are there, maybe fifty?—is a play that completely changes your assumptions about life, so that when you go out and face the world again you look at everything completely differently. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=624))
    - Sit down alone and start free-associating on paper your very private, personal thoughts on the thematic subject area you know you want to write about. Don’t restrict yourself in any way as to what you put down. Describe how you feel about the issues involved. Get angry if you feel angry. Get sad if you feel sad. Give your emotions full play. Express in words everything you can think of on the topic and be one hundred percent honest with yourself as you do it.

    - They don’t shed any light on how to live a fuller, richer life. I walk out of the theater drained, but not fed. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=665))
    - They aren’t looking for fairy-tale endings but, rather, for some answers, some meaningful clues about how to live in this complicated, complex age. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=671))
    - However, even though it’s my idea, I decided not to attempt it because I know nothing about the shoe manufacturing business or the people who populate such a world—the salespeople, the buyers, the inventories, the machinery, the kinds of leather, the designing, the history of the industry, the worries that keep you up at night, and so on. Researching these things was an option, but research is involving, a long-time commitment after which I still might not have felt comfortable with my characters’ world. Deep down, I felt I hadn’t lived and breathed it. It wasn’t a part of me, and it would be difficult for me to really know the people who inhabit it. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=771))
    - It’s very simple. I only know a little bit. And like anybody else, I know certain things very well. And once I get out of that little area I know something about in terms of people, I don’t know it well ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=778))
    - enough to have any original feelings about it. ([Location 779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0062OCO16&location=779))
    - The point is that it is possible to consider writing a play set in a world you know nothing or very little about. However, be sure you have a deep connection to it and then be prepared, before you start the process of writing, to dive into that world head first and learn it as well as you know your own world.
