Well, this prompt that I'm going to show you now I have to get full credit for to this gentleman here, Brett Littlefield, who is in my chat GPT users community, and there's a link underneath this video.

Iteratively craft the best possible prompt with my help ü§ùüìù.

Full script

The problems will be used by you, chat gbt. You'll follow the following process: one: your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I'll provide my answer, but you will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. Then the second thing: based on my input, you'll generate two sections: a revised prompt- so this is like its first attempt at the prompt, based on what you've said- and then it should be clear, concise and easily understood. B questions: ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed for me to improve the prompt. And then, thirdly, we'll continue this iterative process, with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompts in the revised prompt section until I say we're done. So there you go. We're working with chat GPT to develop an incredible prompt, so let's try it out right now and if you're finding this useful, please do like the video and subscribe to my channel for more stuff like this. So great, I'm ready to help you craft the best possible prompt.

"Learn the basics of SEO for beginners with this informative article üìàüîç"

Full script

What would you like the prompt to be about? Okay? Well, I'm gonna have it. Write me an article about SEO, okay. So here we go. I want you to create a prompt to help me write an article, using chat GPT, about SEO for beginners. All right, let's just change that, because it put a c in there, and then we'll just also get rid of that little space that it put in there and go. So, revised prompt: write an informative article using chat gbt on the basics of search engine optimization, SEO and brackets for beginners questions. Now this is where it starts to refine that prompt to give you such a better article. So the first thing it's asking there is: who is your target audience? And you can respond to this just on a new line: one, two, three, four. So I'm gonna say I'm gonna say, let's say, Consultants, okay, I'm gonna put coaches and Consultants. Actually, coaches and Consultants is my target audience. What level of knowledge do they have about SEO? I'm going to put very little. And then a three: is there any specific aspect of SEO that you want to focus on? I'm gonna put that on keywords. And then what is the word count requirement of the article? I'm just going to do one for 500 Words. So 500 Words. There we go and off we go again.

"Learn SEO basics to boost your coaching business üöÄ"

Full script

Revised prompts getting better all the time. Use chat gbt to write a 500 word article for coaches and Consultants who are beginners in SEO, providing an overview of the basics of SEO and how it can benefit their business. And now it's asking me some more questions, three questions here. Can you specify what kind of coaches and Consultants you're targeting: IE life coaches. That's really good. Actually. Let's say, let's go with health coaches, so we'll do those. And then two: would you like me to provide any examples or case studies to illustrate how SEO has benefited other coaches and Consultants? I'm gonna put no because they will likely be made up by chat, GPT and I don't think that's particularly ethical. Where three: are there any specific keywords or topics related to SEO you want me to cover in the article? Yeah, let's just go with SEO for beginners. There you go. So that's the keyword that I would like to Target with the article. And here it goes again. So now it's just improved that prompt just a little bit more.

Full script

Yeah, I reckon it would be a good one to say about attracting new clients. So we go, attracting new clients. Then we'll say: are there any common misconceptions or myths about SEO that you'd like me to dress in this article. Let's put that that SEO does not work anymore, because there was a stage when SEO was pretty hard, but it's, it's back again. I think would you like me to provide any tips on how to track the effectiveness of SEO efforts? I'll just put yes, and there we are, and and it will. It will just keep going until we get this unbelievable prompt right there, and so you can keep going and going like this, and I won't. I won't do it now, but you know you can see it will go on forever. I'm gonna say: now we are done and I am happy, happy with the prompt and let's see what it says there. Now, great, I'm, I'm glad to have been of help. There you go. What a wonderful assistant this is. So now let's take this prompt. Here is the prompt, and I'm going to start a new chat. Let's go up to the top new chat, paste in the prompt that it has given, and I'm also going to add something else to it as well and I'm going to put: please format the article. Well, actually, what do we call it here? Do we call it like: yeah, we please format the article with H1 and H2 titles? And there we are. That's it. I'm just gonna let it do its magic now and here it goes. So it's got. It's got the H1 title at the top there, H2, what is SEO, and so on, and and you can see how quick it writes.

It doesn't have to be to write an article, you know. It could be to create a mid-journey prompt. You know, if you want to have a brilliant prompt to create some artificial intelligence images, it could be used for creating tables, anything that you would normally do with chat GPT. You can use this one prompt, this one amazing prompt, to create the ultimate prompt to give you the best output. So I hope that helped.
