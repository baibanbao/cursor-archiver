- ## Quarantine Diary
- (From Mar.13 to Mar.19, 2020)*
- Hi, there. I am quarantined voluntarily in a local hospital after one day’s fever.  I have had Blood test, CT, of course, and coronavirus test.  Results are awaiting.  Pray for me if you are also a Christian. Have good wishes for me if you are not.
- A  moment ago, everything was beautiful. Wife and kid were having online class.  Flowers were blooming. My father was waiting for me in his car downstairs.  And I was leaving home to face my problem of fever.  #coronaviruschina
- Thank God.  CT is OK.  Temperature 36.7 Celsius.  Wish coronavirus test result would be fine.
- Had an infusion.  The nurse said it’s a kind of anti-virus medicine.  Temperature 37 C.  Night has fallen.
- Well I need to be alone. Alone enough to face the soul of myself. The hospital room is simple but cozy. The TV doesn’t work but no matter. I like silence. I just need a good, short, and solid rest.
- I heard coughs from my neighborhood . Big, long, and happy cough which no one dares to display in the public. But here is the little harbor ready for sailors and travelers. No discrimination, no strange staring, no feeling of being guilty. It is natural to cough, to raise body temperatures as high as one may like. Because it is the quarantine special area of the hospital.
- Temperature 36.5 C. The drinking water is cold. I want to have a sound sleep without a mouse’s stirring.  Hope it will be true.
- the condition in this quarantine area is not good. public toilet, no hot water, no shower room. and worst, someone didn’t/t flush after pooing! though I was not going to use it, I cleaned it. That is my duty because  I know who I am. I am a lucky man who is loved by God.  I have the flame within to warm and lighten the darkness without. And I am happy to do what I have done.
- Got up on 6 AM.  A 5-hour sleep refreshed me. The first thing is to browse twitter to see what happened.  The USA is under emergency.  Went to the public toilet before it was occupied. Afterward washed my hands with a duration of two happy birthday song. Temperature is normal, only 36.2 C.
- I came here voluntarily.  I had an option of not being quarantined. The SOP is to screen CT first, if malfunction of lungs is found, then quarantine becomes mandatory.  But I told the Doc I want to be hospitalized first, then do the medical checks. The CT result was good, which means that they will let me go if I was still in the clinic stage. Why I chose the hard way? Well, I have worried about the possibility of Covid-19 infection for more than 50 days since the day when my sister and her husband came to live with us about two months ago.  They drove from Hubei before the whole province was officially closed. I didn’t blame them. We are a family.  We should stick together. And the reunion of family made my parents happy. I am glad and grateful that they escaped the danger zone.  But I still had been worrying the possibility of infection especially to my dear wife and kid.
- My father is overwhelmingly better than I except one thing. He was a family-centered man but NOT a wife-centered husband. I, as a Christian, see my wife as the bone of my bones.  Husband is the head of a family, but he should take his wife on the most high priority. Wife is more important to her husband than anyone including their children and parents. Man and woman are one flesh. So, I treasure and cherish my own nuclear family more than anything else in the world. Yesterday before I went to hospital, I took this photo of my wife and kid. I know it would be very precious and give me comfort and relief if the very bad things happen.
- Thank God almighty! The Covid-19 test is Negative! Just took the second one.  2 Negatives equals homecoming.
- Visitors are not allowed. But patients can receive parcels from their family.  Sounds familiar. My wife sent me this huge book. It’s better than watching movies which will consume  time and bandwidth.  I really like this kind of old-fashioned book. It details all the plots and analyses all the meat and bones. Reading papers is good.  Reading screens is distracting. The World Movie Classics is my volleyball, my Mr. Wilson.
- Finally, I, myself become a figure too. According to the official announcement by the provincial government, ‘433 persons are under medical observation’. And I am 1/433.
- The food here is salty, plenty, and price friendly. Two steamed bread, a plastic-bowl of corn soup, fried eggs, and potato chips with little pork, only costs 10 Yuan. It can make anyone full but can’t guarantee the nutrition or appetite.  It’s OK for me. I don’t come here to spend a vacation. I come because I have been called here. I just want to have my fever lowered and my strength and health back. The medical staff are very tired as an army who don’t know anything of the future of the war. They just do what they are told to do. You can’t find the morale, confidence and pride of med pros which is often found in some famous big hospitals such as Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai. I understand them. In my hometown only civil servants are regarded as having decent jobs and social status. Doctors, lawyers, are no better than teachers. Nurses are even looked down upon. I have gratitude to all the medical faculty here including the cleaning workers. They are heroes in this special time.  I will say thanks to them when I get out of this place.
- My kid planted a branch in the yard.  In a video phone call, he asked me to pray with him that it may bud and grow. I did it though I know it is against the law of biology. it’s 5 AM and I can’t sleep anymore. I miss my wife and my son. We are not living for ourselves only, but for those we love and care about also. We reap what we sow. No exception. I have wasted many years of my life to live for myself which is just empty and barren. I planted iron branches and steel thorns when I was young. Being blessed, I met my wife and had my son. Everything has been changed. I became a husband and a father.  And miraculously and gradually, I have restored my life of faith. Will the wooden branch planted by my son grow to a tree.? The only thing I know is that I will be like a tree with roots which is my wife, and with fruit, which is my son, and maybe with some seeds, which are my works. I am here for a reason. I am striving to be qualified.
- I said to the sanity worker “Shifu, Ni Xin Ku La” (aka. Master, you are hard and bitter) This expression is heavier and more natural than Xiexie (aka. Thanks). He replied, “patients here seldom say this kind word to me. They think the pay the money, so they deserve it. You are a man with sympathy. ” We had small talks on the hard times, the hardship of hospitalization, and the weather.  We never asked the other which village you come from, which is the biggest privacy in my hometown because from the village and your workplace, your true identification will be quickly discovered. We both respected the privacy of each other.
- Thank God! I am released from the medical observation center — the place where I has been quarantined for three days. I left a thank-you note.  Goodbye.  Farewell.
- When I came back home, my wife and son were giving me welcome by dancing and chanting.  I had a hot shower and a sweet snap. Then we went to the yard to play.  Since gardeners just cut a lot of branches, he and I played with anything handy.  We found some dry fruits looking like golf balls, so an idea jumped into my mind. We collected special branches to make them gold clubs. My kid certainly has a talent. He played an eagle and several birdies. Afterwards, we went to the little garden of my late teacher Ms. Niu  and watered the vegetables that she left since her sudden death last year.  Ms. Niu taught me Chinese in junior middle school.  Once upon a time, I wrote a composition titled My Younger Brother and got a high mark.  After I had the honor to read my masterpiece in front of the whole class, Ms. Niu said: “The essay is well written. But as far as I know, the author has no brothers at all. ” She didn’t know that the boy I described in that fictional work now were coming true and irrigating what she had planted.
- I must rebuild my life after coming from the hospital. Something went wrong. I need to correct them before it’s too late. I don’t want to make plans and rules, which would be broken sooner or later.  I only make a few principles. Don’t be obsessed by mobile phone.  Keep myself away from SNSs. Opinions are not as important as facts.  I need rest. I need recovery.  I need a little time to answer my calling from above.  Last night I had a long walk with my wife.  We talked about the ups and downs recently. The mar is shining in the west sky. At least we have all the stars. I went to bed before 11 PM, which was rare for me.  I shut the iPhone down and drifted into my dream despite the meltdowns in the Wall Street.
- Beneath the stars, in the woods of our yard, under the branch he planted, my son and I sat down on the stools we took and watched the starry night. He asked me to play a song as background music. So, I played ‘Leaning On the Everlasting Arms’ on my iPhone. He said: ‘Dad, I think these woods is a blessed land.  Last time I found the cross. ‘ He meant a piece of wood which is like a crafted cross. He continued: ‘ Let’s pray. ‘ So, we prayed the Lord’s Prayer. He led, and I followed: ‘Our Father in Heaven: Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom comes. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one. For the kingdom, the power, the glory is yours from now to forever. Amen. ‘ After the prayer, he asked: ‘Dad, shall we talk?’ I said: ‘Yes. Let’s talk about the future. What do you want to do when you grow up?’ He replied: ‘I want to be an inventor and a scientist. But sometimes I want to be an anchor of entertainment programs. ‘ ‘ Like a live game youtuber?’ ‘Yes. That’s exactly what I want to be.‘ The Mar was shining brightly like a hospitable host waiting for the immigration from the earth. I think at the due time, a father and a son will talk the same talk and pray the same prayer gazing the blue star on the Venus.
- Time to say goodbye to my hometown. We have stayed here for two months. It’s the longest time for me to live with my parents ever since  I graduated. We live together and die  alone. So, it’s a blessing to reunite with one’s family though there are disputes, quarrels, and bitterness may occur. Time to go back the urban life, the real one. Everything need to be planned and redesigned.  I can’t help going home and reading all my favorite books. The life ahead is exciting.
