修昔底德《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》评语

Thucydides has views - of human nature, religion, the unreliability of the mob, and the inevitable degeneration of democracy - that he means his reader to come to share, but he takes the stand that, far from arguing, he is simply presenting things as they are to a reader who, like him, has a classic mind. He is the original master of the classic feat of presenting his interpretations, evaluations, and judgments as if they are specific, hard, visible facts no different from the many facts that surround them.
