Funeral @all

\[church bells tolling\]

You okay?

\[crows cawing in distance\]

\[Jin chuckles\] Fuckin’ Saul.

Come say hi.

\[Jin\] So sorry.

\[Saul\] Yeah. Me too.

So, this is Prithviraj.

Just Raj, mate.

Nice to meet you. \[clears throat\]

\[Jin\] What is goin’ on here?

I was trying to figure it out on YouTube.

Winner of the Apker Award. Can’t tie a tie.

Well, Lord Kelvin thought that atoms were knotted vortices in the ether.

Ah, did he?

He also thought that there are… \[coughs\]

Thank you.

\[Jin\] Is Auggie here yet?

\[Saul\] She said she’s running late.

\[train clattering on tracks\]

\[horn blares\]

\[indistinct chatter\]

\[woman on PA\] This service is now approaching Oxford,

where this train will terminate.

Please make sure you have all your belongings with you

before you leave the train.

\[breathing shakily\]

\[gasps\]

\[energy thrumming\]

\[inhales sharply\]

\[takes a deep breath\]

\[thrumming intensifies\]

\[glowing numbers sizzling\]

\[thrumming fades\]

\[monks chanting\]

\[Jin\] So sorry for your loss. We all loved your daughter very much.

Thank you for coming.

\[chanting continues\]

\[Vera’s mom\] You’ve all been so kind.

Jin’s looking good.

Phwoar. He’s looking good as well.

What?

Fuck off.

\[Jin sighs\]

\[Jack chuckles softly\]

\[door opens\]

\[both\] Hey.

\[sighs\] How are you doing?

Yeah, you know…

\[sighs softly, sniffles\]

\[Raj mouthing\]

\[Auggie\] Hey.

\[inhales sharply\]

\[whispers\] Did you see the neurologist?

\[quietly\] Yeah.

What’d he say?

She.

She. Oh. Jesus.

She has no clue why it’s happening.

Well, still. It’s still happening?

\[door opens\]

Like, right now?

Like, all the fucking time.

\[door closes\]

\[sighs\]

\[footsteps approach\]

\[tense instrumental music playing\]

\[chanting intensifies\]

\[temple block tapping\]

\[mala beads rattling\]

\[breathing shakily\]

\[sounds distort\]

\[energy thrumming\]

\[menacing music playing\]

\[music cuts out\]

\[man\] You drove, right?

\[indistinct chatter\]

\[camera shutter clicking rapidly\]

\[tense, energetic music playing\]

\[lens whirs\]

\[shutter clicking rapidly\]

\[brakes squeak\]

\[tense music building\]

\[engine revs\]

\[tires squeal\]

\[lens whirs\]

\[camera shutter clicking rapidly\]

\[investigator exhales\]

\[whirring of blades fades into distance\]
