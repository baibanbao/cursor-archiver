Don't dismiss things just because they're popular

If weren't for del Toro, we would have never had the best Harry Potter entry. That's because del Toro convinced Cuarón to do The Prisoner of Azkaban after he found out that Cuarón wasn't interested in the project.

"Del Toro asked, 'Have you read the books?'" Cuarón recalled. "And I said, 'I saw the film; it's not my thing.' And then he asked [again], 'Have you read the books?' And I said, 'No, I have not read the books.' And then he got so pissed off at me. ‘You fuckin' arrogant bastard! Go right now, buy the fuckin’ books and call me back!'"

The rest is history.
