Before the funeral [Will Downing.md](./Will%20Downing.md) and [Jack Rooney.md](./Jack%20Rooney.md)

\[birds singing\]

\[indistinct chatter outside\]

\[water running\]

Excited to see Jin?

Well, it’s not exactly ideal circumstances, is it?

How long has it been?

Don’t know.

I’ll bet you do. I bet you remember to the day.

It’s been a while.

Fuck. I did not sleep at all last night.

Why not?

\[inhales sharply\]

I don’t know, Jack. Maybe it’s, uh…

Maybe it’s because Vera’s killed herself.

\[Jack sighs\]

\[unscrews cap\]

To Vera.

\[gulps\]

\[flask clatters\]

\[rustling\]

Jesus.

Hm?

\[scoffs\]

Hides the tequila smell.

Want one?

No.

Have one.

I don’t want one.

It’s my most popular flavor.

Third highest-selling crisps in the UK

after Walkers Cheese and Onion and Monster Munch Beef.

Congratulations.

Mm-hmm. Suck a dick, Pringles.

\[chuckles\]

\[Jack sniffles\]

\[fastens flask cap\]

Have you heard that Jin’s got a new boyfriend?

Don’t worry.

I bet he’s a total squid.
