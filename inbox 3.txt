# Inbox

- Here you can write disorganised notes to be categorised later
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
- Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  - This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  - For example, you can `Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!


- 想到就写，今天是2021-08-04，我应该做的事情都在[[todo]]之中。

- 现在就开始写作，一点也不耽误。

- Foam 容错性、强壮性，令人瞠目结舌。这是我见过的最强大的文本处理软件。

- 从此可以告别[[Roam Research]]
