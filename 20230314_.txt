How to create memorable characters?

Creating memorable characters is an essential part of screenwriting. Here are some tips on how to create characters that will stick with audiences:

1. Give them a unique personality: Memorable characters have distinct personalities that make them stand out from the crowd. Think about what makes your character different from others in the story and emphasize those traits.

2. Make them relatable: Even if your character is larger than life, audiences need to be able to relate to them on some level. Give your character flaws and vulnerabilities that make them more human.

3. Give them a clear motivation: Characters who have clear goals and motivations are more engaging for audiences. Think about what your character wants and why they want it, and use that to drive their actions throughout the story.

4. Create a backstory: A well-developed backstory can help give your character depth and complexity. Think about where they came from, what their childhood was like, and how those experiences shaped who they are today.

5. Use dialogue to reveal their personality: Memorable characters often have memorable lines of dialogue. Use dialogue to reveal your character's personality, sense of humor, or worldview.

6. Put them in challenging situations: Characters who face difficult challenges or obstacles are more interesting than those who coast through life without any problems. Put your characters in situations where they have to make tough choices or face difficult consequences.

By following these tips, you can create characters that will stick with audiences long after the movie is over.

give me an example from this movie

One example of a memorable character from "Pulp Fiction" is Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Jules has a unique personality that makes him stand out from the other characters in the movie. He's a hitman who quotes Bible verses before killing his targets, which creates an interesting contrast between his violent profession and his spiritual beliefs.

Jules also has a clear motivation throughout the movie. He's trying to leave his life of crime behind and start fresh, which is why he decides to retire after surviving a near-death experience. This goal drives his actions throughout the story and makes him more relatable to audiences.

Finally, Jules is known for his memorable lines of dialogue, such as "I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?" and "Ezekiel 25:17... The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men."

Overall, Jules Winnfield is an excellent example of how to create a memorable character by giving them a unique personality, clear motivation, and memorable dialogue.
