    - Sarah Jane Rehnborg’s Strategic Volunteer Engagement: A Guide for Nonprofit and Public Sector Leaders distills research conducted through the University of Texas at Austin with actual executives of agencies to make a very strong case for what is needed to invest in volunteer effectiveness. I quote from this report throughout the book. Betty Stallings has created a unique resource, Leading the Way to Successful Volunteer Involvement: Practical Tips for Busy Executives. It offers guides, worksheets, checklists, and templates specifically selected or created to assist readers of From the Top Down to put the recommendations here to work. At the end of each chapter, I note the sections of Leading the Way that provide tools to implement the ideas in that part of From the Top Down. Acknowledgments ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=57))

    - All employees must collaborate with that unit in exactly the same way they are expected to work with the physical therapists, the records department, the maintenance staff, or the public relations department. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1742))
    - any volunteer simply because someone doesn’t want to deal with this special category of worker. The director of volunteer involvement must be held accountable to find and prepare the best possible volunteers. If s/he cannot do this, it is grounds for dismissal. But if the director of volunteer involvement is indeed fulfilling this responsibility, then no other staff member has the right to judge the volunteer involvement strategy negatively—and therefore must cooperate. If an employee is uncomfortable with volunteers, the proper administrative response should be to offer training in how to work successfully with volunteers, not to permit him/her to avoid this aspect of the job. Ironically, some directors of volunteer involvement have contributed to the perpetuation of this cycle of “acceptance of rejection.” ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1746))
    - While this may be proper management in the case of a particular volunteer ready to work immediately, it is poor long-range planning. The director of volunteer involvement must identify resistant staff members and—with the help ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1754))

    - Some of the real or imagined threats volunteers pose to employees are expressed in the following list. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1764))
    - If the staff feel that administration does not recognize some of the possible problems volunteers create, they will be reluctant to tell you their genuine reactions to the idea of volunteers—instead, they will undercut (even sabotage) the effort by refusing to be assigned a volunteer or by providing insufficient supervision to volunteers already on board. Volunteers will take paid jobs—maybe my job. Here is a good example of just because you’re paranoid, it does not mean someone is not out to get you. Is it really strange that staff are fearful for their jobs, particularly ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1770))
    - ? Volunteers will do a bad job, and I’ll be left with the blame or the responsibility to “clean up.” (And volunteers can’t be fired, right?) ([Location 1775](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1775))
    - I am also not sure that the time it would take me to do this would be won back in any savings by having the volunteer help me. ([Location 1788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1788))
    - I never learned about volunteer management in my formal education, so I’m not sure how to work with volunteers. But, because I take pride in being a professional, how can I admit that I don’t know how to ([Location 1790](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1790))
    - There are indeed practical issues involved in accommodating volunteers that employees should be encouraged to identify and discuss. It’s fair to acknowledge that volunteers do require staff time; volunteers do have more options for saying no; some volunteers are on ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1808))
    - Some volunteers will be recruited as highly trained specialists, while others may come to your organization as trainees or to fill generalist roles such as friendly visiting. ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=1812))

    - In a comprehensive analysis of undergraduate student volunteerism at the University of Texas at Austin, nearly 90 percent of students who had volunteered with a family member (not to be confused with simply having family members who also volunteer) continued to volunteer when they left home.1 These findings are corroborated by other studies as well. Clearly, family volunteering ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=2407))
    - These range from curriculum-based, “service-learning” activities to completely optional, extracurricular volunteer work coordinated through the school.

    - Idealist (http://www.idealist.org). Idealist (a program of Action Without Borders) is an international multilingual (English, French, and Spanish) site that serves people who wish to volunteer, agencies seeking volunteers, and people seeking jobs in either human resources or volunteer management. In 2007, in partnership with Energize, they opened the Volunteer Management Resource Center (http://www.idealist.org/vmrc) to provide targeted information on the position of volunteer program manager. National Service Resource Center (http://www.nationalserviceresources.org). The National Service Resource Center, administered by ETR Associates, is the knowledge management training and technical assistance provider to the Corporation for National and Community Service (commonly referred to in field as “the Corporation”). Some of its resources are for the use of federally funded service programs such as AmeriCorps and RSVP. But much of the site is publicly accessible and free. Two other useful Corporation sites are Volunteering in America (http://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov), which provides the most recent statistics about volunteering in interactive form, and the National Service-Learning Clearinghouse (http://www.servicelearning.org). Volunteering England (http://www.volunteering.org.uk). The Web site of Volunteering England offers a good deal of excellent information on topics as diverse as corporate employee volunteering, engaging a diverse volunteer force, and more, including downloadable guides on specific subjects. ServiceLeader (http://www.serviceleader.org). ServiceLeader is a project of the RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs of the University of Texas at Austin. It offers a range of practical and research information about volunteer management. World Volunteer Web (http://www.worldvolunteerweb.org). ServiceLeader United Nations Volunteers (UNV) runs World Volunteer Web, a truly international site providing volunteer-related news and information from every country in the United Nations (UN). It is a great starting point to find more in-depth resources in different countries. The Center for Association Leadership (http://www.asaecenter.org). The Center for Association Leadership from the American Society of Association Executives is one go-to source for leaders of membership associations, including professional societies, trade associations, and others who get their work done predominantly through the volunteer participation of their members. The site offers many knowledge resources. BoardSource (http://www.boardsource.org). BoardSource is focused exclusively on developing effective nonprofit boards of directors. The Taproot Foundation (http://www.taprootfoundation.org). The Taproot Foundation is a leader in supporting corporate employee volunteering and pro bono service.

    - Volunteer Opportunity Registries Hardly imaginable a decade ago, one of the important resources today for volunteer engagement is the growing number of online sites where volunteer opportunities can be posted—in a wide array of countries. The largest of these in the United States are http://www.VolunteerMatch.org and http://www.Idealist.org, but there are many more, some narrowly focused on certain types of service or types of volunteers. A number of “aggregator” sites such as http://www.Serve.gov and http://www.AllforGood.org search the largest databases and provide information from all of them to users. Several sites also offer online training and other services for both or either volunteers themselves and project managers. Energize maintains a list of all such sites around the world at http://www.energizeinc.com/prof/volop.html. Online Discussion Forums Just as every other profession, volunteer management has evolved ways for practitioners to exchange information ([Location 4738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=4738))

Blogs Note, as well, that blogs (and, increasingly, microblogs) concerning volunteer issues are proliferating and provide a new source of valuable collegial exchange.

    - • Corporation for National and Community Service (http://www.nationalservice.gov). First formed in 1971 as ACTION (capitalized but not an acronym), this is the federal agency focused on volunteering. The name was changed to the Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) by the Clinton administration in 1993. They state their mission in “What We Do” on their Web site as follows: The Corporation provides grants and training and technical assistance to developing and expanding volunteer organizations. In addition, the Corporation explores, develops, and models effective approaches for using volunteers to meet the nation’s human needs and conducts and disseminates research that helps develop and cultivate knowledge that will enhance the overall effectiveness of national and community service programs. The largest programs they fund or administer are AmeriCorps, which still includes VISTA as a distinct program; the National Senior Service Corps, which includes RSVP, Foster Grandparents, and Senior Companions; and Learn & Serve America. The 2009 Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act has expanded the number of AmeriCorps members and mandates the formation of several new “Corps” for special groups and causes, including military veterans. Annually, the Corporation holds a National Conference on Volunteering and Service (see http://www.volunteeringandservice.org) in conjunction with the Points of Light Institute. • HandsOn Network Generated by the Points of Light Institute (http://www.handsonnetwork.org and http://www.pointsoflight.org). HandsOn Network Generated by the Points of Light Institute (HON/POLI) is the official name selected during the 2008 merger between the former Points of Light Foundation and HandsOn Network. As of the writing of this book, the projects and services of the merged organization are still evolving, as is the division of labor between what the institute will do and what HandsOn will do. They have inherited a number of projects, such as managing National Volunteer Week (usually the third week of April; logos and materials can be downloaded each year at http://www.handsonnetwork.org/programs/more/nvw) and partnering on the National Conference on Volunteering and Service. Along with its network of local affiliates, HON/POLI also works with corporate partners and provides online training for volunteer leaders (i.e., volunteers who serve as team leaders for local HandsOn projects). • Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (http://www.arnova.org). Self-described on their Web site home page as an “interdisciplinary community of people dedicated to fostering through research and education, the creation, application and dissemination of knowledge on nonprofit organizations, philanthropy, civil society and voluntary action,” Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA) members are predominantly academics. They produce the scholarly journal… ([Location 4835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=4835))
    - the Association of Leaders in Volunteer Engagement (AL!VE) is the new national professional association for volunteer resource managers in the United States. Its mission, as stated on its Web site under “Mission, Vision, & Values,” is “to enhance and sustain the spirit of volunteering in America by fostering collaboration and networking, promoting professional development, and providing advocacy for leaders in community engagement.” AL!VE supersedes the former Association for Volunteer Administration (AVA), which closed its doors in 2006. • Council on Certification in Volunteer Administration (http://www.cvacert.org). Practitioners with at least three years of experience in the field of volunteer resources management can earn the credential CVA (Certified in Volunteer Administration) through this unique, international, performance-based program. Originally developed decades ago by the AVA, the CVA program is now sponsored by the Council for Certification in Volunteer Administration. • National Associations for Volunteer Program Managers in Specialized Settings. There are many professional societies for affinity groups, including the Association for Healthcare Volunteer Resource Professionals (AHVRP), the American Association of Museum Volunteers (AAMV), the National Association of Volunteer Programs in Local Government (NAVPLG), and more. Energize maintains a list of such associations at http://www.energizeinc.com/prof/orgspec.html. At the International Level • United Nations Volunteers (http://www.unv.org). United Nations Volunteers (UNV) is the United Nations (UN) organization that contributes to peace and development through volunteerism worldwide. Based in Bonn, Germany, and active in 140 countries, UNV’s main focus is full-time, stipended service by people from one country going to another (the Peace Corps is ([Location 4866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=4866))
    - the UNV affiliate for the United States). In 2001, when the UN declared the “International Year of Volunteers,” UNV was designated as its coordinating body, which propelled it into an advocacy role for the field of volunteerism. That was when it launched the Web site http://www.worldvolunteerweb.org and began producing research and other resources. UNV also coordinates International Volunteer Day, held annually on December 5 since 1985. • International Association for Volunteer Effort (http://www.iave.org). The International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE) was founded in 1970 by a group of volunteers from around the world who saw volunteering as a means of making connections across countries and cultures. It has grown into a global network of volunteers, volunteer organizations, national representatives, and… ([Location 4882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003BEEAH6&location=4882))
