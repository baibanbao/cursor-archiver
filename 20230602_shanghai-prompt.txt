Capture the joyous scene of Shanghai's reopening after a two-month lockdown. The focus should be on the vibrant green meadows on the westbound of the river, where people are picnicking and gathering in celebration. The shot should be taken from a slightly elevated perspective, giving a panoramic view of the meadows and the river. The lighting should be natural, with the warm glow of the afternoon sun casting long shadows and highlighting the joy on people's faces. The colors should be vibrant and saturated, emphasizing the lush green of the meadows and the clear blue of the sky. The composition should be balanced, with the river acting as a natural divider between the cityscape and the meadows. Norman Rockwell style.
