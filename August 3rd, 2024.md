Don't let your life's work disappear. Inflation is a silent thief, and your savings are the target. Use Bitcoin to end central banks.

Central banks love to play god with your money. Time to take control with Bitcoin which they can't manipulate.

If you have 1 whole Bitcoin you’re likely going to be among the 0.2% richest people on earth. Likely much richer because of the high distribution of bitcoins (Gini is at 0.6 and falling).

Today the US Debt passed $35T.

$35T / 21M BTC = $1.67M per BTC.
        - which means that we own 4997w rmb #Finance #[[Jonas]] #[[Seven]]

According to bookmakers there's a 55% chance of Trump becoming President. Then he will buy 1M. Using Bank of America's bull market multiple of x118 we can take a look at how this will affect the price. Current price of BTC is $70k, and current market cap is $1.37T

$70k x 1M coins x 118 = $8.3T

This means total market cap will be $1.37T + $8.3T = $9.67T

$9.67T / 19.73M coins = $490k per BTC.

And this is without focusing on all the other nation states, S&P500 and normies that will FOMO into it.

Also since it's a 55% chance of Trump becoming President we can use simple risk math: $490k x 55% = $269.5k per BTC. This means that BTC is worth at least this today!

Buying Bitcoin with fiat is like buying water with sand in the Sahara desert. It’s the best trade in history.

105 countries have a money printer. If you’re not owning any Bitcoin you’re thinking that none of them will start to print to buy Bitcoin after hearing Trump’s speach yesterday. That’s being naive.

Game theory forces large companies and countries to stack BTC in silence. They have no incentives to announce it.

Enjoy your luck:
Modern humans have lived for 300,000 years and the chance to be alive when perfect money (#bitcoin) was created is 0.02%.

You are not lucky when #bitcoin goes to $1M. You had conviction at $60k when the majority of people didn’t care.
