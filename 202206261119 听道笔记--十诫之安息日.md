- 8 Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
- 9 Work six days and do everything you need to do.
- 10 But the seventh day is a Sabbath to God, your God. Don't do any work - not you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your servant, nor your maid, nor your animals, not even the foreign guest visiting in your town.
- 11 For in six days God made Heaven, Earth, and sea, and everything in them; he rested on the seventh day. Therefore God blessed the Sabbath day; he set it apart as a holy day.
- 圣安息日，预告了一个圣日。
