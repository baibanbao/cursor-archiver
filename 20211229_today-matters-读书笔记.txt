“If you don’t write down your ideas, there is a great danger you will lose them. In Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott explains how she keeps from losing her best ideas:
I have index cards and pens all over the house—by the bed, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, by the phones, and I have them in the glove compartment of my car. I carry one with me in my back pocket when I take my dog for a walk. . . . I used to think that if something was important enough, I’d remember it until I got home, where I could simply write it down in my notebook. . . . But then I wouldn’t. . . . [Writing down your ideas right away is] not cheating. It doesn’t say anything about your character.15”

“Michael Kidwell and Steve Rhode, authors of Get Out of Debt: Smart Solutions to Your Money Problems, believe, “Every person in debt is suffering from some type of depression. Debt is one of the leading causes of divorce, lack of sleep, and poor work performance. It is truly one of the deep dark secrets that people have. It robs them of their self-worth and keeps them from achieving dreams.”13
Going into debt for things that appreciate in value can be a good idea. Purchasing a house, securing transportation so you can work, improving your education, and investing in a business are good things—as long as you can manage them well. But many people incur debt for frivolous things. When you’re still paying for something you no longer use or even have, it means trouble.
Kidwell and Rhode suggest five steps to reduce debt:
1. Stop incurring debt.
2. Track your cash.
3. Plan for the future.
4. Don’t expect instant miracles.
5. Seek professional help.14

Don’t let your possessions or your lifestyle possess you. If you’re a slave to debt, find a way to free yourself.”

“If you find yourself thinking that you have it especially hard in your job or career, you might need to put things into perspective. Take a look at the rules that employees at Mt. Corry Carriage and Iron Works were asked to follow in 1872:
1. Employees will daily sweep the floors, dust the furniture, shelves, and showcases.
2. Each day fill lamps, clean chimneys and trim wicks, wash windows once a week.
3. Each clerk will bring a bucket of water and a scuttle of coal for the day’s business.
4. Make your pens carefully. You may whittle nibs to individual taste.
5. This office will open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. daily except on the Sabbath.
6. Men employees will be given an evening off each week for courting purposes, or two evenings if they go regularly to church.
7. Every employee should lay aside from each pay a goodly sum of his earnings for his benefit during his declining years so that he will not become a burden upon the charity of his betters.
8. Any employee who smokes Spanish cigars, uses liquor in any form, gets shaved at a barber shop, or[…]”
