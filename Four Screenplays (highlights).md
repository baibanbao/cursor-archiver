    - Thelma and Louise, starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, written by Callie Khouri, and directed by Ridley Scott, director of such highly stylized films as Blade Runner, Black Rain, and Aliens. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=222))
    - Every moment took me deeper and deeper into the characters and story. I experienced the film scene by scene by scene, and I trusted the screenwriter and director to take me where they wanted me to go —the ending. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=240))
    - Moments of their relationship, the rape sequence, the truck driver sequence, little bits and pieces of visual memories flooded through me and ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=251))
    - Somehow Thelma and Louise hit a common chord and jangled people’s emotions. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=270))
    - whose approach to screenwriting was not limited by the old concepts of other road movies. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=288))
    - “That’s how I thought of Louise. Now, I love to laugh and I love people who are funny. So I wanted it to be a movie that you were enjoying and having a good time with because in some ways you were watching these women get their lives back. Even though they lose their lives at the end, you watch them as society’s convention is pulled further and pulled out of their grasp, so they become more and more themselves. These were great people to be with, and anybody would have loved to get to know them if they had a chance. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=353))
    - How one little thing can happen and your whole world can fall completely apart. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=384))
    - Everything had to be real and believable. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=386))
    - why she’s sometimes hostile with Thelma, because she felt that if she had really tried, the whole thing could have been avoided, which is really how society feels.” ([Location 395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=395))
    - There are thousands and thousands of women walking around that have something in their past we don’t know about, and they deserve to be treated with respect, whether we had anything to do with it or not.” ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=400))
    - What happened to Louise in Texas is the structural backbone of the entire story line. It’s because of this incident that Louise knows how to use a gun; it’s because of this incident that she runs away from the murder. By the time she realizes what she’s done, it’s too late. Because the “incident in Texas” is ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=402))
    - And good screenwriting is the art of discovery. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=407))
    - The first ten pages of any screenplay are the most important. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=410))
    - A screenplay is a living thing, and each piece, even though separate and complete, is part of a whole. Structure, remember, is the relationship between the parts and the whole. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=416))
    - Basically there are only two ways to open the screenplay effectively: with an action sequence, like Terminator 2, or with an expository, character-driven sequence, like those that open Thelma and Louise or The Silence of the Lambs. That’s ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=419))
    - “Louise is a waitress in a coffee ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=425))
    - Khouri’s visual transitions move the story forward, and as she cuts back and forth between her two main characters she gives us a chance to learn about her characters and see their relationship with each other. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=432))
    - “Film is behavior” is the way the great Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni said it. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=436))
    - experience, a liberating experience to watch that. ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=459))
    - Sometimes there are events in our lives that bring out the best in us. At other times, how we act, and react, or deal with a particular situation tells us who we really are. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=543))
    - James imagined a main character occupying the center of a circle. In this circle, surrounding the main character, are the characters that he or she interacts with. James felt that every interchange between the characters should “illuminate” different aspects of the main character, just as various lamps illuminate different aspects of a dark room. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=576))
    - So much of writing is about getting quiet enough so you can ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=582))
    - hear your characters talking. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=583))
    - “My greatest challenge was not to impose myself on them,” she continues, “and just let them say what they’ve got to say. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=584))
    - “All the time I was writing,” says Khouri, “I felt like I was telling a true story. And all I had to do was wait until somebody told me the next part. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=594))
    - A Plot Point is an incident, episode, or event that hooks into the action and spins it around into another direction ([Location 620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=620))
    - Before you can write one word of the screenplay, you must know your structure: the ending, beginning, Plot Point I, and Plot Point II. The screenwriter builds his or her story around these four elements. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=623))
    - Louise “watches herself in the mirror. She stares as if she’s trying to see into herself, see through herself.” It’s a necessary pause in the action, time to let her take a few deep breaths and settle down, time for us to digest the situation with her. What to do? What to do? ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=745))
    - the Dramatists’ Guild states that no one can change a line in a play unless it’s approved by the author. ([Location 2991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=2991))
    - Sometimes the screenwriter needs to approach a scene directly: You simply write what the scene’s about, like the first scene between Clarice and Crawford. But the screenwriter must always search for another, original way to say what needs to be said, to say it indirectly, as opposed to directly; to avoid the obvious. ([Location 4162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=4162))
    - The tension comes from the audience wanting the character to know what it knows; this technique generates the tension; it made Hitchcock’s films such a treat. This situation is called an “open” story: The audience knows what’s going on, but the character doesn’t. In a “closed” story, the audience learns what’s happening at the same time the character does. ([Location 4190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=4190))
    - If you can leave it open-ended, it will live in the audience’s imagination better. They’re more engaged that way. They will continue the story in their own minds when they leave the theater. ([Location 4291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002QJZ9KE&location=4291))
