- Macbeth Scenes
- Macbeth: Act 1, Scene 7
- Jump to a scene
- A room in Macbeth’s castle.
- MACB.
- If it were done, when ’tis done, then ’twere well
- It were done quickly. If th’ assassination
- Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
- With his surcease, success; that but this blow
- Might be the be-all and the end-all—here,
- But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
- We’ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
- We still have judgment here, that we but teach
- Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
- To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice
- Commends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice
- To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:
- First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
- Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
- Who should against his murderer shut the door,
- Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
- Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
- So clear in his great office, that his virtues
- Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu’d, against
- The deep damnation of his taking-off;
- And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
- Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d
- Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
- Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
- That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
- To prick the sides of my intent, but only
- Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself,
- And falls on th’ other—
- Enter Lady Macbeth.
- How now? What news?
- LADY MACB.
- He has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?
- MACB.
- Hath he ask’d for me?
- LADY MACB.
- Know you not he has?
- MACB.
- We will proceed no further in this business:
- He hath honor’d me of late, and I have bought
- Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
- Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
- Not cast aside so soon.
- LADY MACB.
- Was the hope drunk
- Wherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?
- And wakes it now to look so green and pale
- At what it did so freely? From this time
- Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
- To be the same in thine own act and valor
- As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
- Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,
- And live a coward in thine own esteem,
- Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”
- Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?
- MACB.
- Prithee peace!
- I dare do all that may become a man;
- Who dares do more is none.
- LADY MACB.
- What beast was’t then
- That made you break this enterprise to me?
- When you durst do it, then you were a man;
- And to be more than what you were, you would
- Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place,
- Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
- They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
- Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
- How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me;
- I would, while it was smiling in my face,
- Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums,
- And dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you
- Have done to this.
- MACB.
- If we should fail?
- LADY MACB.
- We fail?
- But screw your courage to the sticking place,
- And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep
- (Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey
- Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains
- Will I with wine and wassail so convince,
- That memory, the warder of the brain,
- Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
- A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
- Their drenched natures lies as in a death,
- What cannot you and I perform upon
- Th’ unguarded Duncan? What not put upon
- His spungy officers, who shall bear the guilt
- Of our great quell?
- MACB.
- Bring forth men-children only!
- For thy undaunted mettle should compose
- Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,
- When we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two
- Of his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,
- That they have done’t?
- LADY MACB.
- Who dares receive it other,
- As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
- Upon his death?
- MACB.
- I am settled, and bend up
- Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
- Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
- False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
- Exeunt.
- 第一幕 第七场 同前，堡中一室
- 麦克白：要是干了以后就完了，那么还是快一点干；要是凭着暗杀的手段，可以攫取美满的结果，又可以排除了一切后患；要是这一刀砍下去，就可以完成一切、终结一切、解决一切——在这人世上，仅仅在这人世上，在时间这大海的浅滩上；那么来生我也就顾不到了。可是在这种事情上，我们往往逃不过现世的裁判；我们树立下血的榜样，教会别人杀人，结果反而自己被人所杀；把毒药投入酒杯里的人，结果也会自己饮酖而死，这就是一丝不爽的报应。他到这儿来本有两重的信任：第一，我是他的亲戚，又是他的臣子，按照名分绝对不能干这样的事；第二，我是他的主人，应当保障他身体的安全，怎么可以自己持刀行刺？而且，这个邓肯秉性仁慈，处理国政，从来没有过失，要是把他杀死了，他的生前的美德，将要像天使一般发出喇叭一样清澈的声音，向世人昭告我的弑君重罪；“怜悯”像一个赤身裸体在狂风中飘游的婴儿，又像一个御气而行的天婴，将要把这可憎的行为揭露在每一个人的眼中，使眼泪淹没叹息。没有一种力量可以鞭策我实现自己的意图，可是我的跃跃欲试的野心，却不顾一切地驱着我去冒颠踬的危险。—— 
- [麦克白夫人上。 
- 麦克白：啊！什么消息？ 
- 麦克白夫人：他快要吃好了；你为什么从大厅里跑了出来？ 
- 麦克白：他有没有问起我？ 
- 麦克白夫人：你不知道他问起过你吗？ 
- 麦克白：我们还是不要进行这一件事情吧。他最近给我极大的尊荣；我也好容易从各种人的嘴里博到了无上的美誉，我的名声现在正在发射最灿烂的光彩，不能这么快就把它丢弃了。 
- 麦克白夫人：难道你把自己沉浸在里面的那种希望，只是醉后的妄想吗？它现在从一场睡梦中醒来，因为追悔自己的孟浪，而吓得脸色这样苍白吗？从这一刻起，我要把你的爱情看作同样靠不住的东西。你不敢让你在行为和勇气上跟你的欲望一致吗？你宁愿像一头畏首畏尾的猫儿，顾全你所认为生命的装饰品的名誉，不惜让你在自己眼中成为一个懦夫，让“我不敢”永远跟随在“我想要”的后面吗？ 
- 麦克白：请你不要说了。只要是男子汉做的事，我都敢做；没有人比我有更大的胆量。 
- 麦克白夫人：那么当初是什么畜生使你把这一种企图告诉我的呢？是男子汉就应当敢作敢为；要是你敢做一个比你更伟大的人物，那才更是一个男子汉。那时候，无论时间和地点都不曾给你下手的方便，可是你却居然决意要实现你的愿望；现在你有了大好的机会，你又失去勇气了。我曾经哺乳过婴孩，知道一个母亲是怎样怜爱那吮吸她乳汁的子女；可是我会在它看着我的脸微笑的时候，从它的柔软的嫩嘴里摘下我的乳头，把它的脑袋砸碎，要是我也像你一样，曾经发誓下这样毒手的话。 
- 麦克白：假如我们失败了—— 
- 麦克白夫人：我们失败！只要你集中你的全副勇气，我们决不会失败。邓肯赶了这一天辛苦的路程，一定睡得很熟；我再去陪他那两个侍卫饮酒作乐，灌得他们头脑昏沉、记忆化成一阵烟雾；等他们烂醉如泥、像死猪一样睡去以后，我们不就可以把那毫无防卫的邓肯随意摆布了吗？我们不是可以把这一件重大的谋杀罪案，推在他的酒醉的侍卫身上吗？ 
- 麦克白：愿你所生育的全是男孩子，因为你的无畏的精神，只应该铸造一些刚强的男性。要是我们在那睡在他寝室里的两个人身上涂抹一些血迹，而且就用他们的刀子，人家会不会相信真是他们干下的事？ 
- 麦克白夫人：等他的死讯传出以后，我们就假意装出号啕痛哭的样子，这样还有谁敢不相信？ 
- 麦克白：我的决心已定，我要用全身的力量，去干这件惊人的举动。去，用最美妙的外表把人们的耳目欺骗；奸诈的心必须罩上虚伪的笑脸。（同下。）

- ### 听课笔记概要
- 主讲人：Owen Horsley （皇家莎士比亚剧院导演）
- ###通过分析、指导演员现场表演《麦克白》A1S7，演示了如何正确理解和翻译莎士比亚。
- 1. 麦克白第一段独白是对谁讲的？（很多人说是对自己、对神明），导演开宗明义地说：是对观众讲的。麦克白不断向观众解释，自己为何想谋杀国王，以及谋杀的障碍是什么？莎翁戏剧的人物独白的目的只有一个：改变观众的想法。
- 2. 因此，莎剧完全是为观众写的。
- 3. 通过两个话剧中心的演员，用汉语表演朱生豪译本，讲解道：理解莎士比亚的关键，是理解人物话语里含有几层思想。A1S7第一段独白中，有几层思想？（演员将其分成7层），导演说：五层。
