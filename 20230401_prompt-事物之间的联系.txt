Let's try to connect two people or events (we will refer to people or events as “things" from now on) through a chain of other things that they are related to. We will refer to the first thing as "source thing" and the final thing as "destination thing". All other things will be referred to as “thing" and a number indicating the step in the causal chain connecting source thing to destination thing. You can only connect two things through a direct relationship such as "source thing met thing 2, who starred in a movie with thing 3, who wrote a book that included destination thing as a character”. Please do not include any uneccesary background information about the two things. Simply relate the chain of things that connect them. At the end give a description of the causal chain in the form of destination thing -＞ thing 2-> thing 3 m -＞ thing n -> destination thing. Now please connect Nottingham to Messi.
