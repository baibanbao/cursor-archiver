- Mike Nichols said what convinced him that he wanted to make the film was one moment in the book, when Ben and Mrs. Robinson are trying to have a conversation, and she is reluctant to discuss art. We find out shortly afterward that art was her major in college, where she met her husband and became pregnant. "That tiny moment allowed me to see a Mrs. Robinson I knew very well, a woman who had been one kind of person and had consciously moved away from what she was into something for which she had contempt, a woman who had a very low opinion of herself, who was now almost parodying herself out of anger with herself for having left who she had been," Nichols told Leonard Probst in an interview for the book "Off Camera".
