【海盗电台按】在中国没有几个人在关心海地，大家更相信“血浓于水”，非我族类，死则死矣，何足道尔。然而，阿の姑娘并不这么想，她创作了这首歌，献给海地中遇难的人们，也唱给这个冷漠的世道。

They Don't Care About (the dying people)

Lyrics/Music/Sung by Ano (阿の)

Have you heard the news lately?
If not, now I tell you a story about a government and its dying people...

Cannot find a smile anywhere
Cannot find a tear anywhere
The planet is quiet as usual
But I know it's giving in to the devil

The government crumbles and tumbles
It gets busy saving itself
It survives forever and...(WHAT A LAUGH!)
In spite of the dying people

They don't care about (the dying people)...
They don't care about (the dying people)...
They don't care about (the dying people)...
They don't care about (the dying people)...

Despair haunts, and...under the sky the winter is frigid as usual...

Cannot find a smile anywhere
Cannot find a tear anywhere
The planet is quiet as usual
But I know it's giving in to the devil

The government crumbles and tumbles
It gets busy saving itself
It survives forever and...(IS IT A MIRACLE?)
In spite of the dying people

They don't care about (the dying people)...
They don't care about (the dying people)...
They don't care about (the dying people)...
They don't care about (the dying people)...

I've told you a story about a government and its dying people, they don't care...they don't care about the dying people.
