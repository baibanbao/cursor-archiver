I used to dream of going to the remote valley to explore.

But today I finally have the chance.

Yes.

My father's friend organized a trip to the valley.

Why is your father involved?

No.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

Today I finally have the chance.

I want to go with my neighbor... neighbor...

I want to go with my uncle, who is a very experienced guide, and my father's friend, a very knowledgeable scientist, Uncle Li, to the valley.

Who is Uncle Li?

No, I just made it up.

We are going to the valley to explore.

First, we will take the Aoxiang flight to Yakbara Valley.

Yakbara Valley.

Yakbara?

Yes, it's a vast plain.

The forest is covered with clouds.

There is a huge lake.

After the plane landed, the three of us got off the plane.

I was stunned by the view.

I was standing there, and my neighbor Uncle Wang patted my shoulder and said, Hey, Xiao En, it's time to go on an adventure.

Uncle Wang opened his backpack.

There were a lot of survival tools in it.

There was a compass, an emergency medical kit, a flashlight, and a pack of compressed dry food.

There were also a few matches and a barbecue grill.

He said that the barbecue grill could be used to grill meat.

I had already known about the Yakbara Valley.

There are huge lakes and many rare fish.

I brought a fishing net to catch fish.

We chose a forest and built a tent.

The scientist Uncle Li went to the forest to collect insect specimens.

Why did you collect insect specimens?

Because the scientist was gone.

I sat in the tent with Uncle Wang and chatted.

At that time, Uncle Li came back.

There were many insects in Uncle Wang's bag.

There were a lot of insects, including a lion, a wolf, a swan, a dragonfly, a dragonfly, a butterfly, and a dragonfly.

Uncle Li said he was hungry and wanted to eat.

Uncle Wang's stomach was also hungry.

Uncle Wang opened Uncle Li's bag and packed a pack of compressed dry food.

Everyone ate.

At that time, there was a sound of pigs.

Uncle Wang said it was a wild pig.

Although the wild pig had no teeth, its two sharp teeth made it run.

The three of us ran to the side.

Because the wild pig was coming to us.

Uncle Wang shouted, climb the tree.

We climbed the tree.

I can't write it down.

I can't write it down.

But I want to write it down.

I'll change it later.

The wild pig can't climb trees.

It was in the tree for a long time.

It just walked.

The three of us jumped off the tree.

Jump off the tree.

But I complained that the compressed dry food was too little.

I wasn't full at all.

But the wild pig didn't give up.

It hit the tree.

If the tree was hit by the wild pig, the three of us would not have survived.

At that time, Uncle Wang took out his poisonous arrow.

It hit the wild pig.

The wild pig looked back at itself in confusion.

A few minutes later, it rolled over with its eyes.

I was still complaining about the compressed dry food.

I'm not full.

I took out the poisonous arrow.

I took out the poisonous arrow.

The wild pig was getting stronger.

I heard the sound of the wild pig.

People said, There is no need to suffer this.

Come and eat here.

The three of us looked back in confusion.

It turned out to be a local mountain name, Awazu.

They said, We have the best food here.

I ran over as soon as I heard the word delicious.

Uncle Wang and Uncle Li rushed over to see.

They rushed over to see.

There was a tribe called Awazu next to the lake.

They usually eat fish in the lake.

We went to their hut.

The Awazu people at the top cut out a fish.

They brought out a plate of raw fish.

They said, This is the latest fish here.

They took up two wooden sticks and made chopsticks.

They wanted to eat.

The sound of the wild pig was heard.

The three of us were in a panic.

We were locked in.

The sound of the wild pig was heard.

Our lake was dirty.

Our lake was dirty.

Our lake was dirty.

Our lake was dirty.

Our lake was dirty.

We were in a panic.

We ran to Uncle Wang's house.
