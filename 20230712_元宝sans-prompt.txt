Create a pixel art scene from the Undertale game universe, specifically a moment of high tension where the character sans, a skeleton with a knack for hacking, is engaged in a digital duel. The setting should be the backstage of the game, a matrix-like environment filled with cascading codes and digital constructs. Sans should be portrayed in his iconic pixelated form, surrounded by his signature bones, but also manipulating streams of code as weapons. The style should be true to the original pixel art of Undertale, with a high contrast between the bright, glowing codes and the darker, more ominous background. The lighting should be dramatic, with the primary light source coming from the codes themselves, casting pixelated shadows. The colors should be a mix of neon blues and greens for the codes, contrasted against the deep blacks and grays of the background. The composition should be a mid-shot, taken with a pixelated lens, with a 16:9 aspect ratio, using a wide-angle lens to capture the vastness of the digital realm. --ar 16:9  --style pixel --q 2 --s 750
