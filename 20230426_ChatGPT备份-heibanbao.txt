Memory in Li Mei's story.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Outcome

These first exercises have enabled us to explore ‘memory’ and how it is recorded in writing. They have addressed a range of questions that are useful to us as writers: What is memory? How do we remember things? What do we remember and why? What is good memory, what is bad memory? What is true memory, what is false memory? What do I mean when I say, ‘We are what we remember and how we remember it’?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the outcome of the first exercises on memory can be understood by exploring how memory plays a crucial role in shaping the characters, their actions, and their relationships. Through these exercises, we have delved into the questions surrounding memory and how it is recorded in writing. By examining memory in Li Mei's story, we can further comprehend the significance of memory in storytelling.

1. What is memory?

Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information from past experiences. In Li Mei's story, her memories of her small village help shape her determination to become a top fashion designer in Hangzhou.

Example: Li Mei vividly remembers the vibrant colors and intricate patterns of the traditional qipao that her grandmother used to wear, inspiring her love for fashion design.

2. How do we remember things?

We remember things through a combination of sensory input, emotional connection, and repeated exposure. Li Mei's story is filled with instances that evoke strong emotions, leading to lasting memories for the characters involved.

Example: Li Mei recalls the intense argument she had with her strict father, Li Jilai, when she decided to move to the city to pursue her dreams. This memory serves as a constant reminder of the challenges she overcame to follow her passion.

3. What do we remember and why?

We tend to remember events that are emotionally significant or personally meaningful. In Li Mei's story, the characters remember events that have a strong impact on their lives or relationships.

Example: Wu Yue, Li Mei's best friend, cherishes the memory of the day they met at an art gallery. They bonded over their shared love for creativity and self-expression, which helped form their strong friendship.

4. What is good memory, what is bad memory?

Good memories are those that bring joy, pride, or a sense of accomplishment, while bad memories are associated with pain, regret, or loss. Both types of memories shape Li Mei's character and her journey.

Example: Li Mei fondly remembers her first fashion show, which marks a significant milestone in her career. In contrast, the memory of her encounter with the corrupt official Liu Taibao and his vengeful actions towards her is a source of fear and sadness.

5. What is true memory, what is false memory?

True memories accurately reflect past events, while false memories are distorted or fabricated recollections. In Li Mei's story, it's essential to differentiate between these two types of memories to understand the characters' motivations and actions.

Example: Huang Shan, Li Mei's rival, falsely remembers Li Mei sabotaging her qipao store, fueling her animosity towards Li Mei. In reality, Li Mei never engaged in such actions.

6. What do I mean when I say, ‘We are what we remember and how we remember it’?

Our memories shape our identity, beliefs, and actions. In Li Mei's story, her memories of her village, her dreams, and her relationships all contribute to her development as a person and a designer.

Example: Li Mei's refusal to become Liu Taibao's mistress is influenced by her memories of her upbringing, her values, and her desire to maintain her integrity. This decision sets the stage for Liu's revenge, further shaping the narrative.

By exploring these questions, we gain a deeper understanding of how memory plays an integral role in Li Mei's story and the overall narrative. This understanding aids writers in crafting more complex and engaging stories that resonate with readers.

Exercise 8 Music and words

Participants: All groups, individual

Music and rhythm can provide an excellent stimulus to the writing process.

1	Close your eyes and listen to a piece of music for a few moments.

2	Let the music continue. Write a speech on a particular subject: war, peace, love, football, etc. Don’t plan ahead. Allow the music to filter into what you are writing, the words you use, etc.

assistant: Exercise 8 Music and words (Li Mei's perspective)

Participants: All groups, individual

Li Mei listens to a beautiful, traditional Chinese melody played on the guzheng, allowing the music to inspire her thoughts and words.

As the music continues, Li Mei writes a heartfelt speech on perseverance:

"Dear friends and fellow dreamers,

Today, I stand before you to speak about perseverance – the unyielding determination to keep moving forward despite the obstacles we face. I have learned that the path to success is not a straight line, but a winding road filled with challenges, heartaches, and self-doubt.

Perseverance is the fuel that drives us to continue chasing our dreams, even when it seems impossible. I come from a small village, with a strict father who couldn't understand my passion for fashion design. But I never gave up, and my journey led me to Hangzhou, where I found friendship, love, and a mentor who believed in me.

In my pursuit to become a top fashion designer, I faced rivalry, as well as encounters with greed and lust embodied by the corrupted official, Liu Taibao. Yet, I persevered, refusing to let his malice deter me from my dreams.

Perseverance is the thread that connects us all. It is the essence of our collective strength, found in the unwavering support of friends like Wu Yue and Chen Ying, and the love of my partner, Zhang Wei.

So, let us celebrate the power of perseverance, the strength we find in ourselves and each other, and the dreams that continue to flourish in the face of adversity.

Thank you."

Li Mei allows the music's rhythm to seep into her speech, with the melody's ebb and flow echoing the emotional journey she's experienced. The music provides a backdrop for her thoughts, shaping the tone and cadence of her words as she speaks on the importance of perseverance.

Exercise 11 Responding to the word

Participants: All groups, individual (4–6 minutes)

Instant-writing can be liberating for any writer, and shows early-stage writers that to produce interesting phrases and original uses of words, they do not have to sit and stare at the sheet of paper waiting for inspira- tion. Indeed, ‘waiting for inspiration’ is the last thing we should be doing; the sitting and pondering comes very far down the line, when we are re- drafting and re-structuring work. The first task is to get it down, in what- ever shape or form, in order to give our critical mind something to work on. This exercise takes us further along this path.

1	Draw a column down the left-hand side of a sheet of paper.

2	At the end of the exercise you will have a list of single words, which I will have given you.

3	You will write the first word in the column.

4	You will immediately write a short phrase or sentence (never just one word) – a thought, a question, a memory, a piece of nonsense – which the word sparks off for you.

5	Do not include the word itself in the phrase or sentence. (See Example 11.1.)

6	You have 10 seconds to write each response.

7	After 10 seconds you will move on to the second word. Stop writing the first phrase, write down the second word in the column, and start writing the second phrase.

8	Keep writing, don’t plan, and if your mind goes blank just write ‘I am writing I am writing’ until something else arrives.

9	Here is the list: Green, Ice, Television, Red, Sand, Love, Religion, Banana, Telephone, Death, Dolphin, London, Shoe, Blue, Mother, Sea, Plane, Summer, Hamburger, Pink, War. (Note to group leader: I usu- ally have a list of 20–25 words, with a good mix of colours, feelings, objects, abstracts and place-names. I never include pronouns. I always try to create a list of words which all members of the particu- lar group will be familiar with.)

10	Read out some of the phrases. (See Examples 11.2.)

assistant: Exercise 11 Responding to the word (Li Mei's perspective)

Participants: All groups, individual (4–6 minutes)

1. Draw a column down the left-hand side of a sheet of paper.

2. At the end of the exercise, you will have a list of single words, which I will have given you.

Li Mei creates a column and writes down the following words:

Fashion, Village, Mentor, Rival, Friendship, Love, Corruption, Courage

3. You will write the first word in the column.

4. You will immediately write a short phrase or sentence (never just one word) – a thought, a question, a memory, a piece of nonsense – which the word sparks off for you.

5. Do not include the word itself in the phrase or sentence.

Li Mei writes her responses:

Fashion - Elegant silhouettes dancing in the wind

Village - The place where dreams were born

Mentor - Guiding light through the darkest nights

Rival - A constant reminder to push further

Friendship - Laughter and support on this winding road

Love - A beating heart that fuels my determination

Corruption - Shadows lurking in the corners of power

Courage - Standing tall in the face of adversity

6. You have 10 seconds to write each response.

7. After 10 seconds, you will move on to the second word. Stop writing the first phrase, write down the second word in the column, and start writing the second phrase.

8. Keep writing, don't plan, and if your mind goes blank just write "I am writing I am writing" until something else arrives.

Li Mei completes the exercise within the given time frame.

9. Read out some of the phrases.

Fashion - Elegant silhouettes dancing in the wind

Village - The place where dreams were born

Mentor - Guiding light through the darkest nights

Rival - A constant reminder to push further

Friendship - Laughter and support on this winding road

Love - A beating heart that fuels my determination

Corruption - Shadows lurking in the corners of power

Courage - Standing tall in the face of adversity

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

This exercise opens the door to a conversation about a very basic aspect of writing: that we all of us have our own individual ways of expressing ourselves through words. The description of ‘war’ as ‘holes in fabric’ is

a brand new image of that event, unique to the person who wrote it. The exercise encourages the writers to trust their own inner voice, and to recognise that creating their own, original work – even if it is one phrase out of the 20–25 or so – is far more interesting than mimicking and repro- ducing what they have heard or read before. Once again, the ‘instant’ nature of the exercise means that they have had the experience of doing it, as opposed to worrying about it.

assistant: Outcome

The outcome of the exercise showcases Li Mei's unique perspective and individual expression through her choice of words and phrases. The exercise has helped her develop a sense of trust in her own inner voice, allowing her to create original work rather than imitating what she has seen or heard before. The phrases she has written provide a glimpse into her life, emotions, and experiences as she navigates her journey towards becoming a top fashion designer in the city. The 'instant' nature of the exercise has allowed her to engage in the creative process without overthinking, thus, letting her subconscious mind guide her writing. This exercise has proven to be a valuable tool for fostering creativity and self-expression in the context of Li Mei's story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 12 Collective poems

Participants: All groups (10–20 minutes)

1	Take the first word from Exercise 11. Go round the circle and hear from the writers all their individual responses to it.

2	There is often much hilarity the first time around, so go back over the word again, this time asking the writers to speak a little more boldly and listening carefully to the different responses.

3	Discuss which images stand out vividly? What is the overall feel and mood? What lines work well next to each other?

4	Read around the circle again. Repeat the process for each word.  What will emerge is a series of collectively created poems –  the Green Poem, the Love Poem, etc. – each built on a range of individ- ual perceptions.

assistant: For the purpose of this exercise, let's imagine that Li Mei, her friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying, her lover Zhang Wei, her mentor Professor Liu, her rival Huang Shan, and a few others are participating.

1. Green

- Li Mei: Morning dew on grass

- Wu Yue: Emerald silk gown

- Chen Ying: Jade pendant, a gift

- Zhang Wei: Bamboo forest sway

- Professor Liu: Tea leaves unfurling

- Wu Yue: Painting with vibrant colors

- Chen Ying: A home-cooked meal shared

- Zhang Wei: Holding hands, walking together

- Professor Liu: Guiding a student towards success

- Huang Shan: A competitive passion, fueling ambition

3. The group discusses the vivid images and overall feel of each poem. They recognize that the Green Poem evokes a sense of nature, growth, and some materialism. The Love Poem conveys different forms of love - romantic, friendship, mentorship, and rivalry.

4. The group goes around the circle, reading the lines of each poem:

The Green Poem:

Morning dew on grass

Emerald silk gown

Jade pendant, a gift

Bamboo forest sway

Tea leaves unfurling

Money, the root of greed

The Love Poem:

A warm embrace in the cold

Painting with vibrant colors

Exercise 13 Poem into performance

Participants: All groups (10–20 minutes)

1	Read one of the poems from Exercise 12 again. Work on it in a bit more detail: it is now more than a random collection of written lines; it is a whole piece. What sort of mood and rhythm comes out? How do the lines sit with each other?

2	Everyone now writes down each line of the poem.

3	When the words ‘I am writing I am writing’ occur, keep these in as they are part of the poem.

4	Everyone now has the same copy of the collectively written poem. (See Example 13.1.)

5	Do the same thing with a few of the other words.

6	Divide up into small groups of 3–5. Each group takes one of the poems.

7	Devise a manner of presenting the poem, in whatever style you choose. Add movement, sound, repetition, choral speaking, etc., keeping in mind that the main aim is to bring the poems to life.

8	Share the results with the whole group.

assistant: For this exercise, let's focus on the Love Poem created in Exercise 12. Li Mei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying will form a group to bring the poem to life.

1. The group reads the Love Poem again and notices its mood and rhythm. They feel it conveys different forms of love and has an uplifting and warm tone.

2. Each person writes down the lines of the poem:

A warm embrace in the cold

Painting with vibrant colors

A home-cooked meal shared

Holding hands, walking together

Guiding a student towards success

A competitive passion, fueling ambition

3. There are no "I am writing I am writing" lines in this poem, so they don't need to include them.

4. Now, everyone has the same copy of the collectively written poem.

5. They decide to focus on the Love Poem for this exercise.

6. Li Mei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying work together to devise a performance that brings the poem to life. They decide to use movement, sound, and choral speaking to emphasize the different forms of love.

7. They plan the performance as follows:

- Li Mei starts by miming a warm embrace while reciting the first line.

- Wu Yue pretends to paint while saying the second line.

- Chen Ying imitates cooking and sharing a meal while reciting the third line.

- All three join hands, walking in a circle and saying the fourth line together.

- They take turns acting as mentor and student for the fifth line.

- Finally, they pretend to compete in a friendly race while reciting the last line.

8. The group shares their performance with the others, showcasing their creativity and the power of collaboration in bringing the Love Poem to life. The performance enhances the emotional impact of the poem, and the audience appreciates the unique interpretations of love expressed through the words and actions.

Exercise 14 Instant writing, instant poems

Participants: Individual (4–6 minutes)

The work described in Exercises 12 and 13 is equally useful as a warm-up for any writer. Just flip through a dictionary, a magazine, or a novel, land- ing on words at random and write your responses. As ever, don’t plan, don’t pause, just write. By the end you will have your list of 20–25 phrases. Select the five most satisfying to you. Play with the order of them, creat- ing a poem. Try doing this every day for a week: five days, five poems. What has that said about your week? What has it said about what you think? What has it said about how you write?

assistant: Li Mei decides to try the exercise to explore her thoughts and emotions through writing. She flips through a fashion magazine and chooses random words. After writing her responses to 20 words, she selects the five most satisfying phrases:

1. Silk whispers against skin

2. The colors of a fading sunset

3. A city skyline illuminated

4. The scent of a blossoming flower

5. Laughter echoing in the streets

Li Mei arranges the phrases to create her poem:

Silk whispers against skin,

The scent of a blossoming flower,

The colors of a fading sunset,

A city skyline illuminated,

Laughter echoing in the streets.

After doing this exercise for five days, Li Mei reflects on her week. Her poems capture her dreams, her love for Hangzhou, her passion for fashion design, and her appreciation for the beauty around her. The poems also reveal her thoughts about her relationships with her friends and lover.

Through this process, Li Mei discovers more about herself and how she writes. The poems showcase her unique voice and ability to express herself through vivid imagery and sensory details. The daily practice of writing helps her gain confidence and sharpen her skills, allowing her to better tell her story and share her experiences with others.

She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

BUILDING A CHARACTER

Watching a play is a bit like observing a controlled experiment in human behaviour. The writer places characters together in a situation, just as the physicist mixes up elements and chemicals, to see what will happen. In both cases, explosions cannot be ruled out. It is no coincidence that a love- smitten person can speak of ‘the chemistry that happened when we met’. Play-reviews speak of the ‘on-stage chemistry’ between the actors.

Some of the experiments in putting characters together in a story, to see what happens, are simple and predictable. In a sentimental romance, we know that the sweethearts will end up together. In a melodrama, we know that the hero will defeat the villain. Different genres of story delve into their characters at different levels: Little Red Riding Hood is much less complex than Hamlet; a character from an Agatha Christie story is likely to be more one-dimensional than one from Maya Angelou. All of them have one thing in common: they were built. Sometimes the foundations are shallow and we get the stereotype; with the best, the observation is deep and wholly original; but they all are based upon some form of research into the human heart and psyche.

How do we start building ‘a character’? A key is the recognition that  there are many sides to an individual. Hamlet continues to fascinate us, not because we know how the story ends (he and everyone else dies) but because, each time we hear it, we discover a new aspect to his character. Even Little Red Riding Hood (as we will see later on) may be more than     ‘the silly little girl who didn’t listen to her mother’s advice’.

I will start this series of exercises with three I developed specifically for use with the primary age group. However, as a reminder of the contradic- tions of human behaviour, and the fluidity of human nature, they are as revealing as many of the more complex exercises.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's explore the process of building a character using a simple exercise to uncover different aspects of her personality and relationships with others.

Exercise: The Contradictions of Human Behavior

1. Choose a character from Li Mei's story (e.g., Li Mei, her father Li Jilai, or her best friend Wu Yue).

2. Identify three opposing pairs of character traits that define the chosen character. For example, for Li Mei: ambitious vs. insecure, compassionate vs. competitive, and traditional vs. innovative.

3. Create a brief scene or dialogue that demonstrates each of these contradictory traits in the character.

Scene 1: Ambitious vs. Insecure

Li Mei stands in front of her sketchpad, drawing an elaborate design for a modern qipao. Her eyes light up as she imagines her creation coming to life on a runway. However, when she overhears her rival Huang Shan boasting about her own designs, Li Mei hesitates, suddenly feeling uncertain about her own abilities.

Scene 2: Compassionate vs. Competitive

Li Mei encounters Wu Yue struggling with her latest artwork. She offers her friend encouragement and advice, demonstrating her compassionate nature. Later, when Li Mei learns about a prestigious fashion design competition, her competitive side takes over as she works tirelessly to create an unforgettable collection.

Scene 3: Traditional vs. Innovative

At her family's traditional qipao store, Li Mei assists her father, Li Jilai, in preserving and promoting the ancient art of qipao-making. Yet, she secretly yearns to revolutionize the fashion industry by incorporating modern styles and techniques into her designs.

Through these simple scenes, we uncover different aspects of Li Mei's character, making her a more complex and intriguing protagonist. By exploring the contradictions in her personality, we gain a deeper understanding of Li Mei and the challenges she faces on her journey to become a top fashion designer.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 15 Today my hand

Participants: Primary (1–3 minutes)

1	Draw the outline of your hand on a sheet of paper.

2	Think of all the things your hand has done today: ordinary things, things you feel good about, things you don’t feel so good about, etc.

3	Around the hand write five sentences, each beginning with the words ‘today my hand . . . ’

4	Discuss all the different things a person’s hand does in a day; how we don’t even think about it, but how much it reveals about who we are and what we are like.

Outcome

This simple exercise shows how, in one day, the same person can do something with love (‘ ... stroked my cat’) and something not quite so lov- ing (‘ . . . pulled my sister’s hair’). It opens a conversation about how a character in a story may be many things, depending on who they are with, what they are doing, how they are feeling, etc.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's perform Exercise 15 to understand Li Mei's character and actions throughout a day.

1. Draw the outline of Li Mei's hand on a sheet of paper.

2. Think of all the things Li Mei's hand has done today in relation to her dream, relationships, and challenges she faces.

3. Around the hand, write five sentences, each beginning with the words "today my hand . . ."

Example sentences:

a. Today my hand sketched a beautiful qipao design, inspired by the flowers in my village.

b. Today my hand held tightly onto Zhang Wei's as we walked together, seeking comfort and support.

c. Today my hand shook with anger as I confronted Liu Taibao, standing up against his advances.

d. Today my hand carefully sewed a qipao for my mentor, Professor Liu, to show my gratitude for his guidance.

e. Today my hand high-fived Wu Yue after her successful art exhibition, celebrating her triumph.

4. Discuss all the different things Li Mei's hand does in a day and how these actions reveal her character, relationships, and emotions.

Outcome:

This simple exercise provides insights into Li Mei's character, such as her passion for fashion design, her love and support for her friends, and her courage to stand up against injustice. It demonstrates how a character's actions can vary throughout a day, influenced by their emotions and the people around them. Understanding these daily actions can help deepen the portrayal of Li Mei and make her a more complex and relatable protagonist.

Exercise 16 Inside–outside Part one

Participants: Primary (3–6 minutes)

1	Think of someone you know and like. Write a physical description of them, so that if I were to meet them I would recognise them. Try and use all five senses. Are they big or small? What does their voice sound like? What sort of shoes do they wear? How do they walk, etc. (See Example 16.1.)

2	Draw a large outline of a person. This is an imaginary character. Around the outline, write as many physical descriptions as you can. Try and be very detailed. If they are wearing a blue shirt, is it bright blue or dark blue? If they have black hair, is it short, curly black hair or long, limp black hair? What are the different ways of describing the sound of a voice? We now have an idea of what that person is like on the out- side. This tells us a little of who they are and what they might be like.

3	Now write inside the outline of the person. In the space where the head is, write down all the different words and phrases that describe ‘thinking’. (See Examples 16.2.)

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

●	Exercises 15–17 all show that, in the creating of a character for a story, we need to know what is done (the hair was pulled), why it was done (the decision to hurt someone) and the result (the feeling of guilt).

●	Interesting stories do not have to be copies of others you know. They can also start from things you know about, and develop on from there.

●	Basic as these exercises are, they introduce to the very young the notion that stories – which come naturally to them anyway – can be developed and made even more interesting through working at them.

●	The investigation of what goes on ‘inside’ is an invaluable way of extending the literacy of emotion, feeling and thought.

●	The exercises open the door to a discussion about the consequences of actions, and the responsibility for our own feelings.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the outcome of Exercises 15-17 showcases:

1. The complexity of characters: These exercises help reveal the different facets of each character's personality, thoughts, and emotions. This enriches their portrayal and makes them more relatable to the reader.

2. Character development: By exploring each character's actions, feelings, and thoughts, we gain a deeper understanding of their motivations, goals, and challenges. This aids in building well-rounded, engaging characters.

3. Storytelling potential: The short stories generated from these exercises demonstrate that unique and interesting stories can emerge from everyday experiences, emotions, and relationships. These exercises encourage creativity and emphasize the importance of exploring personal experiences and emotions in storytelling.

4. Emotional literacy: The exercises provide an opportunity for young writers to explore emotions, feelings, and thoughts, fostering their emotional literacy and enhancing their ability to create emotionally rich characters and stories.

5. Consequences and responsibility: By examining the actions, feelings, and thoughts of characters, these exercises open up discussions about the consequences of actions and the responsibility individuals have for their feelings and decisions.

Overall, these exercises have proven to be valuable tools for character development and storytelling in the context of Li Mei's story, providing insights into the lives of Li Mei and the other characters, and creating a richer, more engaging narrative.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 18 Interviews

Participants: All groups (8–12 minutes)

As with many of the other early-stage exercises, the investigation into the question of how ‘characters are built’ can be helped by looking at our immediate surroundings; in this case, the people we are with.

1	Write a short list of questions you might ask someone if you were conducting an interview for a magazine: likes, dislikes, greatest fears, happiest moment, opinions on world events, etc.; questions you consider would give a wider public a thumbnail sketch of that person.

2	Work in pairs. Interview your partners (2–3 minutes each). Try not to get into general conversation.

3	If you find your interviewee is digressing into unhelpful anecdote, you may lead on to the next question.

4	Write down the answers in note form.

5	Write a 100-word paragraph on your partner, based upon your notes. Try and make it flow, as a magazine article would. You can rearrange things to fit the style of the article.

6	Rewrite the article, inserting a couple of facts or pieces of information that are fictional. Make them believable in terms of the person you are describing, but see if they can have a hint of drama, mystery, etc.

7	Read out the results. What fictional information seemed totally out of place with the general character being described? What fictional information was cleverly placed, as to seem totally in keeping with the person being described?

Outcome

This exercise can lead to a discussion about an essential element in the build- ing of a character: whatever we invest the character with, it has to be credi- ble. This does not mean to say that the quiet man down the road cannot turn out to be a mass-murderer; but only if we can say ‘of course . . . that makes sense of everything we know about him’ when we discover the awful truth.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's conduct an interview with Li Mei and then follow the steps to create a magazine article:

1. List of questions:

- What inspired you to become a fashion designer?

- What do you like most about living in Hangzhou?

- What are your favorite and least favorite things about the fashion industry?

- How do you handle the pressure from your strict father?

- Who are your role models in the fashion industry?

- Can you share a moment in your life that brought you immense happiness?

- What are your thoughts on the current political climate in China?

2 & 3. Imagine conducting the interview and taking notes on Li Mei's answers.

4. Article draft based on the interview:

Li Mei, a young and ambitious fashion designer from Hangzhou, China, aspires to make a name for herself in the city's bustling fashion scene. Growing up in a small village, her passion for design was ignited by traditional Chinese clothing. Despite her strict father's disapproval, she has found support from her friends and mentor, Professor Liu. Li Mei admires designers like Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood for their innovation and creativity. A memorable moment for her was winning her first fashion design competition in Hangzhou. Concerned about China's political climate, she dreams of promoting equality and freedom through her designs.

5. Adding fictional elements:

Li Mei, a young and ambitious fashion designer from Hangzhou, China, aspires to make a name for herself in the city's bustling fashion scene. Growing up in a small village, her passion for design was ignited by traditional Chinese clothing and the discovery of her grandmother's secret collection of exquisite qipaos. Despite her strict father's disapproval, she has found support from her friends and mentor, Professor Liu, who turned out to be a former fashion icon. Li Mei admires designers like Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood for their innovation and creativity. A memorable moment for her was winning her first fashion design competition in Hangzhou, where she received a surprise invitation to a prestigious international fashion event. Concerned about China's political climate, she dreams of promoting equality and freedom through her designs, aiming to revolutionize the industry.

Outcome:

This exercise emphasizes the importance of character credibility, even when adding fictional elements. The introduction of Li Mei's grandmother's qipao collection and Professor Liu's background as a fashion icon adds depth and interest to Li Mei's story while maintaining her character's authenticity. The surprise invitation to the international fashion event adds an element of excitement without straying too far from her character's trajectory.

Drive-based Play Development

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. The example should be a girl who lives in Hangzhou China becoming a fashion designer at last.

Outcome

As you develop your play, bear in mind the use of ongoing exposition; how it continually dips into the suitcase to drive the action forward and

deepen our knowledge of the protagonists. And by far the most important items in that suitcase, in terms of how the narrative will unfold from this point, are their deepest wants, needs and desires. What the protagonists want – their drives – is going to be the key to your structure from this point on.

assistant: In this passage, the author talks about the process of developing a play and emphasizes the importance of ongoing exposition, which is the gradual revelation of information about the story and its characters. The author suggests that a crucial aspect of exposition is the exploration of the protagonists' wants, needs, and desires, as these drives will shape the narrative structure and propel the action forward.

Let's use the example of a girl from Hangzhou, China, who ultimately becomes a fashion designer. We'll call her Li Na.

Imagine a play that tells Li Na's story, starting from her humble beginnings in Hangzhou. As the play progresses, the ongoing exposition would gradually reveal information about her background, her family, her upbringing, and her aspirations. Throughout the play, the audience would come to understand the challenges she faces and the obstacles she must overcome.

Li Na's deepest wants, needs, and desires play a significant role in the narrative. For instance, perhaps she has a deep desire to break free from societal expectations and create a successful career in the fashion industry. This drive will shape the decisions she makes and the conflicts she encounters, ultimately determining the structure of the play.

For example, Act One could introduce Li Na as a young girl who discovers her passion for fashion design. The exposition reveals her struggle to balance her love for fashion with her family's traditional values, which expect her to follow a more conventional career path.

In Act Two, Li Na decides to take the plunge and pursue her dream. She faces numerous challenges, such as leaving her hometown, securing a spot at a prestigious fashion school, and dealing with the competitive nature of the industry. The ongoing exposition deepens our understanding of Li Na's character, showcasing her determination and resilience in the face of adversity.

Act Three shows Li Na working tirelessly to make a name for herself, eventually breaking into the fashion industry and becoming a renowned designer. The play ends with her returning to Hangzhou to showcase her latest collection, demonstrating how her wants, needs, and desires have shaped her journey and transformed her life.

Throughout the play, Li Na's drives—her desire to succeed in fashion and break free from traditional expectations—provide the foundation for the narrative structure. The ongoing exposition allows the audience to understand her motivations, empathize with her struggles, and ultimately celebrate her triumphs.

user: thank you. the girl's name should be Li Mei please.

assistant: Of course, let's revise the example with the protagonist's name as Li Mei.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example in the context of Li mei's story.

STRUCTURE 2: FUSES AND BOMBS

The structure of the play and its forward drive are essentially bound up   with the lives and actions of the protagonists. A small detail you have inserted into the  exposition  –  a  piece  of  information,  a  chance  remark, a seemingly innocent action – can have huge repercussions later on in the play. What you are doing is laying fuses and planting unexploded bombs. Once again, every detail is there for a purpose.

In Chapter 4 we did some work around The First  Major  Turning  Point: that moment in the play when the protagonist ‘steps  off  the path’ – literally in the case of Little Red Riding Hood, morally in the case of Macbeth. In both cases it was a result of a conflict of interests. The sta- tus quo is at risk. Little Red’s wish to follow her mother’s instructions loses out to her desire to pick the flowers. Macbeth’s first step down the path to eternal damnation is when desire for earthly glory won out on his wish to be a good and loyal servant of his king.

The fact that I have just used the phrase ‘in the case of’ is perhaps not coincidental. One way of looking at a play is as a ‘case study’: an examina- tion of how specific characters operate under specific circumstances. The psychoanalyst puts the spotlight on the patient’s past in order to see how the influences of the past (and the choices of action/non-action in life flowing from that) have led to the present. The playwright creates fictional characters to do very much the same; that is, to see what led up to the outcome. How will it all turn out?

‘The ending is everything’ is something you will hear fiction writers say- ing. If the ending (conclusion, resolution, finale or payoff) is to be truly sat- isfying, it has to be absolutely rooted in its beginning. That is why we have spent so much time on life histories, exposition, status quo, etc. It’s rather like building a house: great walls, beautiful roof, but if it’s built on sand it’ll just topple over. A play, like a building, is an act of architecture.

From now you will be working from the character, scene and story-idea you began to develop in Chapter 4. I’ll be asking you to develop them in classic form – that is, where character development and narrative develop- ment are intertwined, in linear form. You may finally subvert that form, just as Samuel Beckett did. But if we do accept that we are working with

a craft (remember ‘-wright’ as opposed to ‘-write’?) then we can subvert only if we know the basic principles.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the "Fuses and Bombs" structure refers to the idea that small details, remarks, or actions introduced during the exposition can have significant consequences later on in the play. These details are like "fuses" that ignite or "bombs" that explode when the narrative reaches a critical point. This structure emphasizes the importance of cause and effect, ensuring that the play's conclusion is deeply rooted in its beginning and is a satisfying outcome for the audience.

An example of a "fuse" in Li Mei's story could be her early interest in sketching and designing clothes for her dolls, which initially seems like an innocent childhood hobby. This detail, however, later ignites her passion for fashion design, leading her to pursue a career in the industry.

A "bomb" in Li Mei's story could be a seemingly insignificant conversation she has with a visiting fashion designer in Hangzhou. This encounter plants the idea in Li Mei's mind that she could follow her dreams and become a successful fashion designer, despite the challenges she may face. As the play progresses, this "bomb" explodes when Li Mei decides to defy her family's expectations and take the risk of pursuing her passion.

The First Major Turning Point in Li Mei's story might be when she makes the difficult decision to leave her hometown and attend a prestigious fashion school. This choice represents her "stepping off the path" of her family's traditional values, as her desire to succeed in the fashion world wins out over the expectations of her family.

Li Mei's play can be seen as a "case study," exploring how her specific circumstances and choices lead her to her ultimate success as a fashion designer. The conclusion of the play must be deeply connected to its beginning, as the earlier events in Li Mei's life lay the foundation for her journey. By building the play on a solid structure, the playwright ensures that the story is coherent, engaging, and satisfying for the audience.

As you develop Li Mei's play, remember to intertwine character development and narrative development in a linear form. While it's possible to subvert this form eventually, it's important to first understand the basic principles of playwriting and create a solid foundation for the story's structure.

user: do the following exercise in the context of Li mei's story

Exercise 84 The conflict between the conscious and the unconscious

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Go back to the characters you developed in the Chapter 4 exercises. Consider what their conscious wants (needs, desires, etc.) are at the start of the story. The character I briefly developed in that chapter – Taresh – might say, ‘To be able to obtain those little things I need which would make my life bearable: bits of tobacco, enough money for the opera.’

2	Now think about what their unconscious wants might be. Taresh’s might be to regain the self-respect he once felt.

3	Now think about what the conflict between the two might be. With Taresh, I would suggest that, if he were to go down the path of petty theft, the further he would take himself away from the possibility of self-respect.

assistant: 1. Conscious Wants (needs, desires, etc.):

At the start of the story, Li Mei's conscious wants include exploring her passion for fashion design, gaining her family's approval, and finding a way to balance her love for fashion with her family's traditional values. Li Mei might say, "I want to pursue my passion for fashion design, while still respecting my family's expectations and making them proud."

2. Unconscious Wants:

Li Mei's unconscious wants could be to break free from the constraints of her traditional upbringing, assert her independence, and prove to herself that she can succeed in a competitive industry. She might want to prove her worth not only to her family but also to herself, overcoming any internal doubts or fears about her capabilities.

3. Conflict between the Conscious and Unconscious Wants:

The conflict between Li Mei's conscious and unconscious wants lies in the struggle to balance her passion for fashion design with her family's expectations. As she pursues her dreams, she may feel guilty for defying her family's wishes or experience self-doubt about her abilities. The further she delves into the world of fashion, the more she risks alienating her family and potentially losing their support. This conflict could manifest in difficult decisions and emotional turmoil throughout the play, as Li Mei grapples with balancing her desire for personal success and her need for familial approval.

user: adapt the following into li mei's story.

Don’t worry too much at this point if you are not sure what the uncon- scious desire or need is. Part of the task of writing a first draft is to dis- cover your characters and your story. It might be that you won’t discover key things until after you have finished the draft. But bear in mind the fact that all stories are – to greater or lesser degrees – based upon the conflict between what the protagonists consciously think they want, and what they unconsciously desire. A character might express himself as good and loyal, and might be perceived so in his actions by the other charac- ters. Where the drama lies is in seeing if, when exposed to temptations, ‘road blocks’, new opportunities, etc., the sleeping inner desires are aroused. There is an interesting moment early in Macbeth, where the king is speaking of the traitor Cawdor, who had been previously one of the most trusted:

There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face: He was a gentleman on whom I built

An absolute trust.

(Act 1, Scene 4)

Immediately Macbeth enters and the king says how much he values him and how much he owes him, to which Macbeth replies:

The service and the loyalty I owe,

In doing it, pays itself. Your highness’ part Is to receive our duties; and our duties

Are to your throne and state, children and servants . . .

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the idea of the conflict between conscious and unconscious desires plays a significant role in shaping her character development and the overall narrative. While writing the first draft of the play, it is essential to explore and discover these desires, even if they are not immediately apparent.

In the context of Li Mei's story, let's adapt the concept of the character's inner desires being aroused when exposed to temptations or new opportunities.

During Li Mei's time in the prestigious fashion school, she meets a fellow student, Zhang, who comes from a wealthy and influential family in the fashion industry. Zhang is well-connected and offers Li Mei an opportunity to work with a renowned designer on a significant project. This opportunity presents a potential shortcut to success, tempting Li Mei to use Zhang's connections to advance her career.

At this moment, Li Mei's unconscious desires for success and recognition conflict with her conscious wants of earning her family's approval and achieving her goals through hard work and determination. She struggles to reconcile these conflicting desires, ultimately deciding whether to accept Zhang's offer or continue working diligently to achieve success on her own terms.

This conflict echoes the quote from Macbeth, where the king initially trusts Cawdor, only to be betrayed by him. In Li Mei's story, her family, particularly her parents, might initially trust her to follow their traditional values and expectations. But as Li Mei is exposed to the temptations and opportunities in the fashion world, her unconscious desires are aroused, leading her to make choices that challenge their trust.

When Li Mei returns to Hangzhou to showcase her latest collection, she faces her family and acknowledges the choices she has made. She might express her gratitude for their support and reaffirm her loyalty to them, similar to Macbeth's response to the king:

"The support and the love I owe,

In pursuing my dreams, strengthens our bond. Your role as my family is to receive my gratitude; and my responsibility

Is to honor our values and cherish our connection . . ."

By exploring the conflict between Li Mei's conscious and unconscious desires throughout the play, the audience gains a deeper understanding of her character, empathizing with her struggles and celebrating her ultimate success as a fashion designer.

user: please continue based on the additional materials and instruction

Here we have Macbeth expressing his conscious values and intentions, juxtaposed with the example of a  Cawdor:  a  man  equally  trusted  by the king, but who harboured in his ‘mind’s construction’ other values entirely. And we know what is going to happen when we get to the Major Turning Point, where Macbeth fails to make it very clear to Lady Macbeth that there will be no talk of murder.  With Macbeth, the conflict between  the conscious and the unconscious is huge. This is because as the unconscious desire (power, earthly glory) makes itself known and asserts itself through his actions, the protagonist’s self-awareness that he is head- ing for eternal damnation grows  and  grows.  At  all  points  along  the  way he struggles with this: in Act 1, Scene 7 he says to Lady Macbeth,  ‘We will proceed no further in this business’, only to be provoked further down the road when she makes the speech about dashing her baby’s brains out.

So the conflict between the conscious and the unconscious is essentially one of values. Without this struggle there would be no drama. With Macbeth it is the fight between those values he knows are right, both socially (feudal loyalty) and morally (Christian duty), and the stakes are very high. In a different type of story, we might have a high-living, self- indulgent person whose unconscious need is to live a simple, spiritual   life. Once again, the drama would lie in that person’s resistance to that need, and how it wins out – or fails to.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the conflict between her conscious and unconscious desires creates tension and drama throughout the play. Her conscious values revolve around respecting her family's expectations and pursuing her passion for fashion design through hard work and perseverance. Meanwhile, her unconscious desires are centered around asserting her independence, breaking free from traditional constraints, and achieving success in the competitive fashion industry.

The contrast between Li Mei's conscious and unconscious desires becomes increasingly apparent as she faces various challenges and temptations throughout her journey. For example, when Li Mei is offered the opportunity to work with a renowned designer through Zhang's connections, she struggles with her loyalty to her family and her internal desire for success and recognition. This struggle mirrors Macbeth's internal conflict between his loyalty to the king and his desire for power and earthly glory.

As the play progresses, Li Mei's internal conflict intensifies, reflecting her growing self-awareness of the potential consequences of her actions. Her decisions to pursue her passion for fashion design and accept Zhang's offer may lead her down a path that could alienate her from her family and compromise her values.

In a pivotal scene, Li Mei finds herself reflecting on her choices and the potential damage they may have caused to her relationship with her family. She might express her inner turmoil, similar to Macbeth's struggle in Act 1, Scene 7:

"I will proceed no further in this path of temptation,

My loyalty to my family is my strength and foundation."

Despite her initial resistance, Li Mei may eventually embrace her unconscious desires, leading her to make choices that challenge her family's expectations and force her to confront the consequences of her actions.

Ultimately, Li Mei's story is about the struggle between her conscious values (family loyalty, hard work, and perseverance) and her unconscious desires (independence, success, and recognition). The drama unfolds as she navigates the conflicts between these competing values, culminating in a satisfying resolution that sees Li Mei reconciling her desires and re-establishing her relationship with her family.

Whether Li Mei's unconscious needs win out or fail to overcome her conscious values, the core of the play's drama lies in her internal struggle and her journey to find balance between her aspirations and her family's expectations.

Exercise 85 Continuing the conflict

Participants: All groups, individual

What we are discovering is that the ‘character’ of the protagonist is revealed by their choice of action – what they consciously do, or fail to do. And these actions are revealed when they are put under some sort of pressure. The pressure can be Little Red’s desire to please herself and pick the pretty flow- ers, so leaving the straight path her mother has instructed her to stay on; or Lady Macbeth’s taunt that her husband is less up to the task than she is.

So, the structure of a play can be seen as a progression of conflicts, in which the protagonist deals with the increasing pressures between the conscious and the unconscious. You could call this the arc of the story: the progression of events that take the protagonist from status quo to final outcome.

Without going into a developed story at all, draw up a list of conscious (C) and unconscious (U) drives or goals a protagonist might have. Make them as opposite as possible, so that the fuses for conflict are laid.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create a list of her conscious (C) and unconscious (U) drives or goals that create conflict and form the basis for the play's structure.

1. (C) Pursue her passion for fashion design while respecting her family's traditional values.

(U) Assert her independence and break free from the constraints of her traditional upbringing.

2. (C) Gain her family's approval and make them proud of her achievements.

(U) Prove her worth to herself and others in the competitive fashion industry.

3. (C) Balance her career aspirations with her responsibilities towards her family.

(U) Achieve personal success and recognition, even if it means distancing herself from her family.

4. (C) Maintain a strong connection with her cultural roots and uphold the values taught by her parents.

(U) Embrace new experiences and ideas that may challenge her cultural identity and upbringing.

5. (C) Work hard and rely on her own merits to achieve success in the fashion world.

(U) Utilize any connections or shortcuts available to her to secure a successful career quickly.

As the play progresses, Li Mei's journey can be structured around these conflicts, with each conflict escalating the pressure she faces in balancing her conscious and unconscious desires. This arc of the story will take Li Mei from her initial status quo, where she dreams of becoming a fashion designer while living in Hangzhou, China, to the final outcome, where she must confront the consequences of her choices and reconcile her conflicting desires.

user: Exercise 86 Developing the battle

Participants: All groups, individual

Take a couple of the examples from the above list. Jot down the possible answers to the following questions. Allow them to help you to imagine  a journey the protagonist is on.

1	How will the unconscious goal be revealed?

2	Will the protagonist embrace and accept the unconscious goal?

3	What steps will the protagonist take to avoid the unconscious goal?

4	What obstacles are placed along the way to prevent the protagonist achieving the unconscious goal?

5	Does the protagonist achieve/fail to achieve the unconscious goal?

6	What does it cost the protagonist to achieve/fail to achieve the unconscious goal?

7	What has been the big change in the character of the protagonist between the outset and the status quo and the resolution of the final outcome?

assistant: For this exercise, we will focus on two examples of Li Mei's conflicting conscious and unconscious goals from the previous list:

Example 1:

(C) Pursue her passion for fashion design while respecting her family's traditional values.

(U) Assert her independence and break free from the constraints of her traditional upbringing.

Example 2:

(C) Work hard and rely on her own merits to achieve success in the fashion world.

(U) Utilize any connections or shortcuts available to her to secure a successful career quickly.

1. How will the unconscious goal be revealed?

Li Mei's unconscious goals could be revealed through the opportunities and temptations she encounters in the fashion school, like meeting Zhang and being offered a shortcut to success or feeling the pressure to break free from her family's expectations.

2. Will the protagonist embrace and accept the unconscious goal?

Li Mei may initially resist her unconscious goals, but as the story progresses, she might gradually embrace them and take actions that align with these desires.

3. What steps will the protagonist take to avoid the unconscious goal?

To avoid her unconscious goals, Li Mei might try to stay true to her family's values by working diligently, avoiding shortcuts, and maintaining close contact with her family to keep herself grounded.

4. What obstacles are placed along the way to prevent the protagonist from achieving the unconscious goal?

Obstacles might include her family's disapproval, her own guilt and internal conflict, competition from other students, and the challenges of navigating the fashion industry.

5. Does the protagonist achieve/fail to achieve the unconscious goal?

This can vary depending on the desired outcome for the play. Li Mei could either achieve her unconscious goals by finding a balance between her ambitions and family values or fail to achieve them, ultimately deciding to prioritize her conscious goals.

6. What does it cost the protagonist to achieve/fail to achieve the unconscious goal?

If Li Mei achieves her unconscious goals, it may cost her some of her close relationships with her family, forcing her to confront the consequences of her choices. If she fails to achieve them, she might face disappointment and struggle with the question of whether she could have been more successful if she had pursued those goals.

7. What has been the big change in the character of the protagonist between the outset and the status quo and the resolution of the final outcome?

Li Mei's character undergoes a significant transformation as she learns to navigate the conflict between her conscious and unconscious desires. She grows as a person, becoming more self-aware, resilient, and willing to accept the consequences of her choices. Depending on the play's resolution, Li Mei may learn to balance her ambitions and family values or make peace with her decisions and their outcomes.

user: compare the following answer with yours. and find the difference and lessons behind please.

Example 86.1

Take my example of the ‘“I must be a loyal wife” (C), “I desire my freedom” (U)’. When thinking about the character, remember all the work done earlier on specificity: this is not just any wife, but this particular one.

●	A single friend of hers has won a free holiday for two, to Greece.

●	She says she can’t take time off, as the small business she and her husband own is not doing so well.

●	She finds at the back of her cupboard the old back-pack she used when she was a student.

●	She takes the back-pack to the Oxfam shop.

●	In the Oxfam shop she finds a pile of old records, dating back to her hippie days. She buys them.

●	She plays the record for her husband, who says the business is doing really badly and scoffs at her for wasting money on old junk.

●	They discuss the business and how to get through the year.

●	The friend rings from the airport.

●	Etc.

The final outcome would demonstrate how she does, or does not, achieve freedom. What you are plotting are those moments of change (or refusal to change) which take her towards, or away from, her desire for freedom.

assistant: Comparing the given example with Li Mei's story:

In the given example, the protagonist is a woman with the conscious goal of being a loyal wife and the unconscious desire for her freedom. The story revolves around a series of events that bring her closer to or farther from this unconscious desire.

In Li Mei's story, the protagonist is a young woman with conscious goals of pursuing a fashion design career while respecting her family's values and working hard to achieve success. Her unconscious goals are asserting her independence and breaking free from her traditional upbringing and utilizing connections or shortcuts for a quick path to success.

Both stories showcase the protagonists' internal conflicts between conscious and unconscious goals. The given example demonstrates this conflict through the wife's actions and decisions in response to her friend's offer of a free holiday and the encounters with her past. In Li Mei's story, the conflict is depicted through her struggles with family expectations, the fashion industry, and the choices she makes in pursuing her dreams.

The lessons to be learned from comparing these two examples include:

1. Specificity: The characters and situations should be specific and relatable, making it easier for the audience to connect with the story and understand the protagonist's conflicts.

2. Progression of events: Both stories present a series of events that reveal the protagonists' unconscious desires and challenge their conscious goals. These events can either bring the characters closer to or farther from their unconscious goals.

3. Choices and consequences: The protagonists' choices and actions play a crucial role in determining the story's outcome. Their decisions, driven by the conflict between their conscious and unconscious goals, can lead to different consequences, shaping their character development and the story's resolution.

By understanding these lessons, we can create more compelling stories that effectively portray the characters' internal conflicts and their journey towards resolving these conflicts.

Outcome

The answering of all these questions will provide you with the basis for the architecture of your story. It should be clear by now that the journey of the protagonist, character, story and plot are totally bound up with each other. In Chapter 1, we noted that ‘to plot’ a play is just that: the play- wright is conspiring to completely involve the unsuspecting audience in her fiction. She draws them in with the characters she reveals, she hooks them with the conflicts in the story, she traps them in the unfolding plot. She rewards them with a satisfying outcome.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the outcome is the culmination of her character development, the story, and the plot as they intertwine and lead to a resolution that provides a satisfying and meaningful conclusion.

Example:

Li Mei, a young girl from Hangzhou, China, dreams of becoming a successful fashion designer. Her journey begins with her conscious goals of respecting her family's traditional values and working hard in the fashion industry. However, her unconscious desires for independence and the temptation of shortcuts to success create internal conflicts that shape her story.

Throughout the play, Li Mei faces various challenges and decisions that test her determination, principles, and character. The audience is drawn into the story by witnessing Li Mei's struggles with her family, career aspirations, and personal growth.

For instance, Li Mei's parents might insist on her pursuing a more traditional career, causing a conflict between their expectations and her dreams. This situation forces Li Mei to make a choice between appeasing her parents or following her passion.

As the story progresses, Li Mei encounters other challenges in the fashion industry, such as a well-connected mentor who offers her a shortcut to success in exchange for compromising her values. This creates another internal conflict for Li Mei and adds a layer of intrigue to the plot.

Li Mei's decisions and actions shape her character development and the direction of the story. Suppose she eventually realizes the importance of staying true to herself and her values. In that case, the audience will be rewarded with a satisfying outcome where Li Mei achieves success in the fashion industry on her own terms, demonstrating her growth and newfound independence.

In summary, the outcome of Li Mei's story results from the interplay of her character, the story, and the plot, with each aspect deeply connected and influencing one another. The playwright effectively draws the audience into the story through engaging characters and conflicts, ultimately rewarding them with a satisfying and meaningful resolution.

THE FINAL OUTCOME

The phrase ‘the ending is all’, has been mentioned. We all know when we feel cheated by an ending. That doesn’t mean that the ‘good’ character has

to necessarily come off well, or that a ‘bad’ one has to get his just desserts. It’s more  to  do  with   instinctively   knowing   that   the   ending   is   just not ‘true’ to the drama that has been unfolding, when we know we have somehow been cheated by the payoff. There was a time when ‘happy end- ings’ were written into some of Shakespeare’s tragedies, and Cordelia doesn’t die and it all ends merrily after the  mayhem.  There  were Hollywood films (in the 1940s and 1950s particularly) in which the cen-   sors, as guardians of a state-imposed morality,  would not allow the villain  to get away with the crime, even when everything about the story said things were heading that way.

It is something to do with the ending having to feel appropriate to every- thing that has led up to it. If the three sisters, in Chekhov’s play, had packed their bags and got on the train to Moscow at the end, we might not feel so sad for them, but we’d feel totally let down by the playwright.

So what makes an ending ‘appropriate’? Why is it appropriate that the girl should get the boy in As You Like It, that the lovers should die in Romeo and Juliet, that the murderer gets caught in any Agatha Christie play, and that Oedipus should gouge his eyes out? We, the audience don’t know if Rosalind will get Orlando, but everything prompts us to believe she will    and we want to know how.We do know that Romeo and Juliet end up dead (the Prologue has told us), but again we want to know how. We don’t know who did the murder on the Orient Express, but we want to know who and why. We don’t know why a terrible fate awaits Oedipus, but we want to know what it will be. We know that Little Red has placed herself and her grandmother in terrible danger, and we want to know if and how she gets them all out of it.

The appropriate ending is the ending that (a) answers the questions that are summoned up in our minds by the beginning, but (b) is arrived at in  ways we did not expect.

assistant: In detail, the final outcome of a story should be a satisfying and appropriate resolution that addresses the questions and expectations raised by the beginning of the story. The audience should feel that the ending is consistent with the events that have unfolded throughout the narrative, while still offering unexpected twists or turns. An appropriate ending respects the themes, characters, and overall tone of the story, providing a sense of closure and leaving the audience with a sense of fulfillment.

For example, let's revisit Li Mei's story. Throughout the play, Li Mei struggles with her passion for fashion design and her family's expectations for her to follow a more traditional career path. The audience becomes invested in Li Mei's journey, empathizing with her internal conflict and rooting for her to succeed.

An appropriate ending for Li Mei's story would address the questions raised at the beginning of the play: Will Li Mei be able to pursue her dreams while still respecting her family's values? Can she find success in the fashion industry without compromising her integrity? The ending should remain true to the story's themes of personal growth, determination, and the balance between cultural expectations and individual aspirations.

Suppose the story concludes with Li Mei earning recognition for her designs and launching a successful fashion line, while also finding a way to honor her family's values. This resolution would provide the audience with the satisfaction of witnessing Li Mei's growth, learning to assert herself and navigate the challenges that come with following her passion. The ending might also include unexpected elements, such as Li Mei incorporating traditional Chinese elements into her designs or finding a way to involve her family in her new business.

In this case, the appropriate ending (a) answers the initial questions about Li Mei's ability to pursue her dreams and balance her family's expectations, and (b) offers unexpected elements that add depth and interest to the resolution. The audience is rewarded with a satisfying conclusion that remains true to the story's themes, characters, and plot, and ultimately provides a sense of closure.

user: analyze this and compare it to li mei's story

Example 86.2

Let’s take the earlier example of the woman who consciously wants to be  a loyal wife, but who unconsciously desires her freedom. Taking on board all that we’ve done around character-creation, world of the story etc., let’s imagine we’ve got her to the First Major Turning Point: the moment where she goes off the path from loyal wifehood and recognises that there are other things she wants from life. The questions that are summoned up  are

(a) will she get what she wants? (b) how will she get what she wants? and

(c) what does she really want? This last is very important, because      it might be that what she really wants is to be a loyal wife and have her freedom. So the endings for this story – all appropriate to the dilemma

that her conscious/unconscious load on her at the start – could be any of the following:

●	After a series of setbacks and struggles she discovers a new life on   a Greek island with another free spirit.

●	After a series of setbacks and struggles she settles for a new life on a Greek island that is a replica of her old life in the London suburbs.

●	After a series of setbacks and struggles she resigns herself to her old life back in the London suburbs.

●	After a series of setbacks and struggles she realises her true freedom lies with her old life back in the London suburbs.

●	Etc.

assistant: Example 86.2 presents the story of a woman who consciously wants to be a loyal wife but unconsciously desires her freedom. This internal conflict forms the core of her story. The First Major Turning Point occurs when she deviates from her path as a loyal wife and realizes she wants more from life.

Comparing this to Li Mei's story, we see similarities in the central conflicts. Li Mei's story revolves around her passion for fashion design and her family's expectations for a more traditional career path. Both stories feature protagonists grappling with internal conflicts and balancing personal desires with external expectations.

In Example 86.2, the possible endings explore different outcomes based on the woman's choices and how she reconciles her conscious and unconscious desires. These endings can be happy, sad, or bittersweet, but they remain appropriate to the story's themes and the protagonist's journey.

Similarly, in Li Mei's story, various endings can be imagined based on her choices and how she deals with her passion for fashion design and her family's expectations. Possible endings for Li Mei's story could include:

1. Li Mei successfully establishes her fashion line, incorporating traditional Chinese elements that please her family, achieving a balance between her dreams and her family's values.

2. Li Mei abandons her fashion dreams and conforms to her family's expectations, only to later realize she can't suppress her passion for design.

3. Li Mei pursues her fashion career, but her family refuses to accept her choices, leading to a strained relationship and a bittersweet success in the fashion world.

These endings, like those in Example 86.2, address the central conflict and provide a resolution that is consistent with the story's themes and character development. By examining both stories, we can see how the protagonists' internal conflicts drive their respective narratives and how different endings can offer satisfying and appropriate resolutions that remain true to the stories' themes, characters, and plots.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example in the context of li mei's story

assistant: The appropriate ending for a story (a) answers the questions that are summoned up in our minds by the beginning and (b) is arrived at in ways we did not expect. It should also remain true to the story's themes, characters, and plots. In Li Mei's story, the central conflict revolves around her passion for fashion design and her family's expectations for a more traditional career path. As the story progresses, the audience would naturally have questions about how Li Mei will balance her dreams and her family's values, what choices she will make, and what the consequences of those choices will be.

Let's consider one possible ending for Li Mei's story that adheres to these principles:

Throughout the story, Li Mei faces various challenges and pressures from her family while pursuing her passion for fashion design. Her family's disapproval and her struggles in the fashion industry take a toll on her. However, she remains determined and resourceful.

One day, Li Mei discovers that her grandmother was once a skilled embroiderer who created beautiful traditional Chinese garments. This revelation inspires Li Mei to create a fashion line that combines her modern design sensibilities with her cultural heritage. Li Mei's family slowly begins to appreciate her talent and dedication, realizing that she is honoring her roots and preserving their cultural legacy through her designs.

Li Mei's designs gain recognition in the fashion world, and she successfully establishes her brand. Her family finally comes to support her, and they attend her first major fashion show together, proudly watching as her creations grace the runway. Li Mei's success in the fashion industry leads to her reconciling with her family and finding a balance between her dreams and her family's values.

This ending is appropriate because it answers the questions raised by the beginning of the story, such as whether Li Mei will be able to pursue her passion while satisfying her family's expectations, and how she will navigate the challenges she faces. The revelation about her grandmother's past and the incorporation of traditional elements in her designs are unexpected yet meaningful twists that add depth to the story. The ending showcases Li Mei's growth as a character and is consistent with the themes of personal growth, family dynamics, and cultural identity.

Outcome

Any of these endings would have (a) answered the questions that were summoned up for us at the start and – if they had kept us guessing –

(b) given us the answers in ways we do not expect. This is an interesting one, and a challenging one for a writer. I personally love the idea of some- one who is trapped by the notion of ‘loyalty’ (duty, responsibility, etc.) going off and eventually finding individual freedom on a Greek island; but as a dramatic conflict it feels rather thin. On the other hand, the notion of someone who wants all that, but who returns to ‘what is known’ and accepts it as a sort of ‘freedom’ is not something that appeals personally; but it contains more interest on a dramatic level.

A play by Noel Coward, which eventually became a film called Brief Encounter, comes to mind. It is the story of a suburban English housewife in the 1940s. She meets a stranger (a doctor, also married) in the buffet of a train station. Over a series of encounters they fall in love. Everything in us wants them to kick over the traces and make a new life together. Everything in the story is telling us that it is impossible – the society they live in, the innate self-repression of the protagonists, the moral codes of the time – and we know that it is doomed. We know that it will end terri- bly. What we want to know (against every hope) is how. The brilliance of the story is that we instinctively know how it will end, and the hook is we don’t know how. At all points in the narrative, the protagonists could say, ‘What the hell, let’s just run off together,’ but given their natures and the world they inhabit, we would be very let down if they had done so – much as we would like them to.

The old phrases ‘keeping the audience on the edge of their seats’ (thriller) and ‘they were rolling in the aisles’ (comedy) tell us a lot. One is about the suspense of the expectation (who did it, etc.); the other is about the

surprise of the unexpected. In both cases the audience is being ‘set up’, and finally gets what they want – a gasp of surprise or a good laugh – but in ways they did not expect.

assistant: The outcome of a story should answer the questions raised at the beginning and provide satisfying answers in ways the audience doesn't expect. This balance between fulfilling audience expectations and surprising them keeps them engaged and makes the story memorable.

Let's apply this principle to Li Mei's story:

Throughout the story, the audience would wonder whether Li Mei will succeed in pursuing her passion for fashion design while also meeting her family's expectations. They would also be curious about how she will overcome the challenges that arise from this conflict.

Imagine a twist where Li Mei learns about a prestigious fashion competition with a significant cash prize. She decides to participate, seeing this as a chance to prove herself to her family and gain their support. The audience would be kept on the edge of their seats, wondering whether Li Mei will win the competition and how her family will react.

As the story unfolds, Li Mei makes it to the final round of the competition. However, she faces a tough decision when her family faces a financial crisis that threatens their business. Li Mei must choose between using her competition winnings to save her family's business or investing in her fashion career.

In the end, Li Mei decides to use the prize money to save her family's business, but her family, touched by her sacrifice, decides to support her passion for fashion and help her find a way to pursue it. This outcome answers the questions raised at the beginning of the story and offers a satisfying resolution to the central conflict. It also provides an unexpected twist that deepens Li Mei's character and adds emotional depth to the story.

This outcome demonstrates the importance of balancing audience expectations with surprising plot developments, keeping the audience engaged, and delivering a satisfying and memorable story.

THE STRUGGLE FOR ARTICULACY

How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge! What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time

Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.

Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, * [Intelligence]* Looking before and after, gave us not

That capability and god-like reason

To fust* in us unused. [Grow mouldy, rot]*

( Hamlet, Act IV, Scene 4)

In developing the poetics of the language your characters are speaking, bear this in mind: all human beings desire to be understood, and desire to understand their own thoughts. Generally, we don’t do a good job of it, and the English language is littered with the evidence:

● I just don’t get it.

● I don’t understand why I said that.

● I don’t get your drift.

● I can’t fathom her.

● I can’t believe my ears.

● I’m not making any sense am I?

● I can’t explain.

● Do you get my meaning?

● You haven’t listened to a single word I’ve said.

● Words fail me. [Add to the list]

By ‘struggling to be understood’ I mean the struggle to articulate our thoughts and feelings exactly, through the vocabulary at our disposal. This does not always mean ‘telling the truth’, of course. There are situa- tions where we use sophisticated tactics to cover up. We lie, dissemble, prevaricate, pretend not to have heard, deliberately mislead, etc. Many

a good drama has been made from the basis of the clever killer’s alibi versus the clever detective’s outwitting of him. Hamlet – one of the most articu- late fictional creations – spends the play (a) failing to understand his own nature, and (b) successfully fooling everyone else into thinking he is mad. In fact, the key to most dramas can be seen as the battle against the failure to articulate. Or perhaps, the struggle to be understood.

The characters in your play all have their own individual voices; which are of course different versions of your own individual voice. In earlier chapters we have explored ways of arriving at this differentiation. Here, I am suggesting that underlying everything is the struggle for articulacy and the different levels it is operating on. All of your characters have thoughts; the struggle to articulate them forms the poetics of their speech and the dynamic of the story.

assistant: The struggle for articulacy refers to the characters' attempts to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and motivations effectively. In the context of Li Mei's story, this struggle can be seen in the interactions between the characters, as they each try to convey their intentions, desires, and emotions.

Let's explore some examples of how the struggle for articulacy can manifest in Li Mei's story:

1. Li Mei and her father, Li Jilai: Li Mei struggles to articulate her dreams and passion for fashion design to her strict father, who might not understand or approve of her aspirations. Conversely, Li Jilai may have difficulty expressing his concerns and reasons for wanting Li Mei to follow a more traditional path. Their communication struggles can lead to misunderstandings and conflict, which further drives the story.

2. Li Mei and her friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying: Li Mei might find it challenging to convey her struggles and inner turmoil to her friends, while Wu Yue, being a lesbian, may have her own struggle to articulate her identity and experiences in a society that might not fully accept her. Chen Ying, as a beautiful housewife, might find it hard to express her desires for a life beyond her current situation.

3. Li Mei and her lover, Zhang Wei: The relationship between Li Mei and Zhang Wei could also showcase the struggle for articulacy, as they navigate their love and support for one another amidst the various challenges they face. Their communication might be hindered by external pressures or their own insecurities.

4. Li Mei and her rival, Huang Shan: Li Mei's rivalry with Huang Shan may highlight their struggle to express their mutual respect and the common ground they share as entrepreneurs in the fashion industry, despite their differences.

5. Li Mei and the villain, Liu Taibao: As Li Mei faces the corrupt official Liu Taibao, she must find a way to articulate her refusal to become his mistress and stand up against his revenge attempts. Liu Taibao, on the other hand, may struggle to express his greed and lust in a way that masks his true intentions.

By considering the struggle for articulacy in Li Mei's story, you can explore the complexities of human communication and how these struggles shape the characters' interactions, relationships, and the overall narrative. This will add depth and emotional resonance to the story, making it more engaging and relatable to the audience.

BEWARE OF WORDS

Writers should always be wary of the ways in which words and phrases can use us, when we imagine we are using them. This is not to say that cliché, quotation, reference to, parody of, etc., are not useful tools – as long as we are aware that we are using them. In the struggle to develop our own individual voices, the following two quotations (which struck me as very original when I came across them) may be useful:

‘The trouble with words is that you don’t know whose mouths they’ve been in.’

(Dennis Potter, talking about ‘Patriotism’)

‘I can say I love London. I can say I love England. I can’t say I love my country, because I don’t know what that means.’

(Alan Bennett)

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, it's crucial to be mindful of how words and phrases can influence the narrative and characterization. Writers should be conscious of the words they choose and avoid clichés, ensuring that their characters' dialogues are unique and true to their individual voices.

For example, Li Mei's father, Li Jilai, might have strong opinions about his daughter pursuing a career in fashion design. Instead of using clichéd phrases to express his concerns, like "You need to choose a more practical career," Li Jilai could say something more specific to his character: "Fashion is a fickle world, Li Mei. I've seen people struggle to make a living, and I don't want that for you."

Similarly, when Wu Yue talks about her artwork, she might avoid using overused phrases to describe her creative process. Instead of saying, "Art is my passion," Wu Yue could reveal something more personal and insightful about her relationship with her work: "When I paint, I feel like I can express my true self without judgment or fear."

By being conscious of the words and phrases used by each character, the writer can avoid falling into the trap of clichés and make the story more engaging and authentic. This also helps to develop the individual voices of each character, making them more relatable and distinct from one another.

Remember, when crafting a story, always be cautious of the words and phrases you use. Make sure they truly represent the characters and their emotions, rather than relying on clichés or overused expressions. This will help to create a more vivid and captivating narrative, ultimately enriching the reader's experience.

user: pls give more examples to explain this.

assistant: Certainly! Let's look at more examples of how to avoid clichés and overused phrases in Li Mei's story:

1. When Li Mei talks about her dreams and aspirations in fashion design, instead of saying, "I want to follow my dreams," she could say, "I've always been captivated by the colors and patterns of fabric, and transforming them into something beautiful feels like my calling."

2. When Professor Liu, Li Mei's mentor, offers advice, instead of using a cliché like, "Believe in yourself, and you can achieve anything," he could say, "The fashion world is competitive, but if you focus on honing your skills and staying true to your vision, you'll make a name for yourself."

3. When Chen Ying, the beautiful housewife, discusses her life, instead of saying, "I'm living the dream," she might say, "I'm grateful for the life I have, but sometimes I wonder if there's more out there for me."

4. When Zhang Wei, Li Mei's lover, expresses his love for her, rather than using the cliché, "You complete me," he could say, "Li Mei, you bring light and inspiration into my life, and I cherish every moment we spend together."

5. When the villain, Liu Taibao, speaks about his nefarious plans, instead of saying, "You'll regret crossing me," he could use more specific language to reflect his character, such as, "You may have defied me this time, Li Mei, but remember that power and influence can change the course of one's life in unexpected ways."

By focusing on developing the individual voices of each character and avoiding clichés, the writer can create a more engaging and authentic narrative. This helps to distinguish each character and make their dialogues more compelling, allowing the reader to connect with the story on a deeper level.

assistant: INT. LI MEI'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Li Mei and her father, Li Jilai, sit in the modest living room. The tension in the air is palpable. Li Mei takes a deep breath, preparing to tell her father about Liu Taibao's intentions.

LI MEI

(softly)

Father, there's something I need to tell you. It's about Liu Taibao, the corrupt official.

Li Jilai looks up, his eyes filled with concern.

LI JILAI

What is it, my child?

LI MEI

(nervously)

Liu Taibao has approached me with... an unsavory proposition. He desires something from me that I cannot, and will not, give him.

Li Jilai frowns, trying to understand what Li Mei is saying without explicitly stating it.

LI JILAI

What exactly does he want, Li Mei?

LI MEI

(lowering her voice)

He wants me to... be with him, in a way that a woman should only be with her husband. He's trying to force me into becoming his mistress.

Li Jilai's face turns red with anger, but he tries to keep his composure for Li Mei's sake.

LI JILAI

(calmly)

I understand now. I'm so sorry you have to face such a vile person, Li Mei. But know that I stand by you, and we will not let him win.

LI MEI

(teary-eyed)

Thank you, Father. Your support means everything to me.

Li Jilai hugs Li Mei, comforting her, as they both face the uncertainty of the situation together.

8	Second draft

You now have your story, your characters and a first draft of your play. You have also begun to realise the themes you are working with, and you have gained confidence in the use of your own individual or collective voices as dramatic poets and storytellers. This is the moment when you will go right back to the start and see what is useful, what is redundant and what needs to be developed and added. We will start this chapter by revisiting some of the things we looked at earlier, in order to help us step back and take a look at the big picture.

All of the exercises in this chapter may be used in the following ways:

●	By the individual playwright.

●	As ongoing group workshop exercises.

●	For further developing group-written performance pieces.

THE BIG PICTURE

Now we will go back to other aspects of composition, structure, etc., some of which we have touched on before. It is worth reminding ourselves of these, because now is the moment to look at the big picture of how your play will be put together. The following will equip you to move on to your second draft.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's consider the process of moving from a first draft to a second draft by examining the big picture of the play. To do this, we'll revisit composition, structure, and other aspects we touched on earlier.

1. Review the overall structure: Examine the beginning, middle, and end of the play to ensure it flows logically and effectively. Are there any scenes or moments that need to be reworked or removed? For example, you might want to add a scene where Li Mei gets advice from her mentor, Professor Liu, on how to handle Liu Taibao.

2. Character development: Check if the characters in the story have distinct personalities, clear motivations, and relatable struggles. Do they grow and change throughout the play? Make sure Li Mei's friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, have their own subplots and contribute meaningfully to the story.

3. Dialogue: Review the dialogue to ensure it's engaging, natural, and true to each character's voice. Make sure the conversations between characters advance the plot and reveal information about their relationships. For example, refine the conversation between Li Mei and her father, Li Jilai, to make it even more impactful.

4. Conflict and resolution: Ensure there are clear conflicts and resolutions throughout the play. The central conflict in Li Mei's story revolves around her pursuit of becoming a top fashion designer while dealing with the villainous Liu Taibao. Check if the resolution to this conflict is satisfying and logical.

5. Themes: Identify and develop the themes of your play. In Li Mei's story, themes might include pursuing one's dreams, standing up against corruption, and the importance of family and friendship.

6. Stage directions and visual elements: Consider the visual aspects of the play, including set design, props, and costumes. For example, describe the traditional qipao store operated by Li Mei's rival, Huang Shan, in detail.

7. Read your play aloud: This helps you identify areas where the dialogue may sound unnatural or where the pacing feels off. Organize a table read with friends or fellow writers to get feedback on how the play sounds when performed.

By revisiting these aspects of your play, you can refine and polish your first draft into a more cohesive and engaging second draft. This process will allow you to take a step back and examine the big picture of Li Mei's story, ensuring it is a compelling and well-structured play.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 106 Back-story

Remember the image of the suitcase? When your characters are intro- duced, they are all carrying the invisible suitcase packed with everything

about their lives and the world they inhabit. Check through the luggage. Are there any items in the suitcase you need to throw out or replace?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's go through the back-story of the main characters and examine their invisible suitcases. We'll consider if there are any elements that need to be removed or replaced to make the story more compelling.

1. Li Mei: She carries her dreams of becoming a top fashion designer and her upbringing in a small village. Her determination and passion for fashion are essential items in her suitcase. However, consider adding more depth to her background or family history that may impact her journey.

2. Li Jilai: As Li Mei's strict father, his suitcase contains his concern for his daughter's future and his traditional values. Examine if there are any aspects of his character or past that could be further developed, such as his own ambitions or regrets that influence his strictness.

3. Wu Yue: As a lesbian artist and Li Mei's best friend, Wu Yue has her own struggles and aspirations. In her suitcase, consider adding unique experiences or challenges she has faced, which could provide more depth to her friendship with Li Mei and her role in the story.

4. Chen Ying: A beautiful housewife and Li Mei's friend, her suitcase contains her supportive nature and the complexities of her personal life. To add more depth to her character, consider exploring her own dreams or aspirations, and how they intertwine with Li Mei's journey.

5. Zhang Wei: Li Mei's lover, his suitcase carries his love for Li Mei and his own life outside their relationship. To enhance his role in the story, consider exploring his career, background, or personal struggles that may impact their relationship.

6. Professor Liu: As Li Mei's mentor, his suitcase is filled with wisdom and experiences from his own career. To strengthen his character, consider adding a past failure or success that shapes his mentorship and relationship with Li Mei.

7. Huang Shan: Li Mei's rival, her suitcase contains her ambition and her competitive nature. To create a more dynamic rivalry, consider including a backstory that explains the source of her competitive spirit or any personal connections to Li Mei or other characters.

8. Liu Taibao: The villain in the story, his suitcase carries his greed, lust, and corrupt nature. To make him a more well-rounded character, consider exploring his background, motivations, or vulnerabilities that led him down this dark path.

By examining the back-stories and contents of each character's invisible suitcase, you can identify any elements that need to be removed or replaced to enrich the overall story and create more engaging, multi-dimensional characters.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 107 Opening scene

Your opening scene is key. We have already done quite a lot of work around the functions of the opening scene of a play. The phrase ‘setting the agenda’ has been used. The musical term ‘overture’ also comes to mind. A dictionary definition of the word: ‘a piece of instrumental music intended as the intro- duction to an opera, oratorio, etc.’. ‘Introduction’ is the key word. The com- poser Gluck (eighteenth century) said that the function of the overture was ‘to prepare the audience for the plot of the play’. An opening scene has a range of functions. Does yours include any or all of the following?

1	A sense of the ‘world of the play’ – contemporary, historical, mythical – that is specific to itself and therefore universal. The conventions, habits and nature of that world and how it operates.

2	Exposition: story. An introduction to the ‘story-action’ that prepares the audience. The facts (or supposed facts) the audience will be told.

3	Exposition: character. An introduction to the protagonist(s), either through themselves or on a reported basis. What they say about themselves, what others say about them.

4	Theme(s). Major topics that the play deals with, not necessarily spelled out but woven into the dialogue and the action.

5	Mood and atmosphere. The words that are used, their musicality, the rhythms of the dialogue.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create an opening scene that incorporates the elements mentioned in Exercise 107:

(Scene: A traditional qipao store in Hangzhou. Li Mei is working diligently on a qipao design, while her best friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, watch her work.)

WU YUE: (admiring the qipao) Li Mei, your designs are truly exceptional. I can see your passion in every stitch.

LI MEI: Thank you, Wu Yue. I just hope one day I can make my mark on the fashion world here in Hangzhou.

CHEN YING: With your talent, Li Mei, I have no doubt you'll achieve your dreams. But what does your father think about it?

LI MEI: (sighs) Father is still very traditional. He wants me to follow a more conservative path, but I'm determined to prove myself.

(Enter Professor Liu, Li Mei's mentor.)

PROFESSOR LIU: Li Mei, your designs are coming along nicely. Your hard work is evident. Just remember, the path to success is never easy.

(The sound of laughter is heard from outside the store. Huang Shan, Li Mei's rival, passes by with a group of customers, showing off her qipao designs.)

HUANG SHAN: (smirking) Keep dreaming, Li Mei. This city only has room for one top qipao designer, and that's me.

(As Huang Shan leaves, Li Mei looks more determined than ever.)

LI MEI: I won't let her bring me down. I will become the top fashion designer in this city, no matter what it takes.

(The opening scene gives a sense of the world of the play, taking place in Hangzhou, China, where traditional fashion and modern aspirations collide. It provides exposition for the story and introduces the protagonist, Li Mei, her friends, mentor, and rival. Themes of ambition, determination, and overcoming challenges are woven into the dialogue, setting the mood and atmosphere for the rest of the play.)

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 108 Exposition

Throughout the play you will be unpacking items from the suitcase that are useful to the telling of the story. Their functions include (a) allowing the audience to inhabit the world of the play, (b) allowing the audience to follow the journeys of the characters, (c) fuelling the action and (d) laying unexploded bombs.

Go through your play and ask the following questions:

1	Where and how do moments of exposition occur in your play?

2	Are there moments of exposition that serve no function, or hinder the development of the story?

3	What important bits of information, needed by the audience, are missing?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze moments of exposition in the play.

1. Moments of exposition in the play:

- Opening scene: Li Mei's ambition to become a top fashion designer and her father's disapproval are introduced. Her friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying, as well as her mentor, Professor Liu, and her rival, Huang Shan, are introduced.

- A scene where Li Mei shares her struggles and dreams with her lover, Zhang Wei, deepening their relationship and exposing their emotional connection.

- A scene where Li Mei encounters Liu Taibao and learns about his wicked intentions. This serves as the introduction of the main conflict between Li Mei and Liu Taibao.

- A scene where Li Mei discovers the depth of Huang Shan's rivalry and their competition intensifies.

- A scene where Li Mei's father, Li Jilai, confronts her about her career choice and their relationship becomes strained.

2. Identifying moments of exposition that serve no function or hinder story development:

- If there's a scene discussing Li Mei's childhood hobbies or interests that are unrelated to her current ambitions or struggles, it could be removed or revised to be more relevant to the story.

3. Identifying missing information needed by the audience:

- The audience might need more information about the significance of qipao in Chinese culture and why it's important for Li Mei to succeed as a designer in this field.

- The audience could benefit from understanding how Li Mei's small village background influences her character and her aspirations.

- Additional backstory about Liu Taibao's corrupt behavior and his impact on the community could provide more context for his role as the villain in Li Mei's story.

By assessing these points of exposition, you can ensure that the play maintains a strong narrative, keeps the audience engaged, and develops characters in a way that supports the overall story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 109 The protagonist Part one

The protagonist is the person (or persons) whose story the play is telling. The audience will be focussed on their journey. In some plays it is clear who that is (Hamlet; Vladimir and Estragon); in others, where there are a range of characters who have equal ‘air time’, it might not seem so obvious. You need to know, so ask yourself the following:

1	Whose story are you telling?

2	Has the focus begun to shift from your original protagonist towards another character?

3	How would it affect the story if you shifted the central focus to another character?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story:

1. Whose story are you telling?

The story is primarily focused on Li Mei, a young girl from a small village in Hangzhou, China, who dreams of becoming a top fashion designer in the city. The play follows her journey as she navigates personal relationships, professional rivalries, and a dangerous conflict with a corrupt official, Liu Taibao.

2. Has the focus begun to shift from your original protagonist towards another character?

If during the development of the play, scenes and dialogues have started to give more importance to secondary characters, like her friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying, her father Li Jilai, or her mentor Professor Liu, it might be time to evaluate whether the focus has shifted from Li Mei. In this case, it is essential to ensure that Li Mei remains the central character and that any scenes involving secondary characters contribute to her story and character development.

3. How would it affect the story if you shifted the central focus to another character?

Shifting the central focus to another character would change the entire perspective and narrative of the play. For example, if the focus shifted to Li Mei's father, Li Jilai, the play might become a story about a traditional father struggling with his daughter's aspirations in a modern world. Alternatively, if the focus were on Liu Taibao, the play could become a cautionary tale about corruption and the abuse of power. While these alternative storylines could be interesting, it's important to remember that the original intent was to tell Li Mei's story and her journey to become a top fashion designer while overcoming various challenges.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Part two – the protagonist

If you are unsure whose story is at the heart of the play, try writing it out (in story form) from the points of view of several of the characters.

Example 109.1

Retell Little Red Riding Hood from the point of view of: the grandmother; the mother; the wolf; the wood-cutter.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's retell the story from the points of view of several characters:

Li Jilai (Li Mei's father) - As a strict and traditional father, Li Jilai is concerned about his daughter's dreams of becoming a top fashion designer in the city. He worries about the challenges she might face, and the values she could lose along the way. He is torn between his love for Li Mei and his duty to protect her, as well as his desire to see her follow a more conventional path.

Wu Yue (Li Mei's best friend) - Wu Yue, a lesbian artist, admires Li Mei's determination to pursue her dreams despite the societal pressures they both face. As they navigate the challenges of life in the city, Wu Yue supports Li Mei's aspirations and encourages her to break free from the constraints placed on her by her father and their traditional village upbringing.

Chen Ying (Li Mei's other best friend) - Chen Ying, a beautiful housewife, is fascinated by Li Mei's pursuit of her dreams. Although she has chosen a more traditional life, she admires Li Mei's courage and ambition. Chen Ying becomes an unexpected source of strength and support for Li Mei in her journey to become a successful fashion designer.

Liu Taibao (the corrupt official) - Liu Taibao, a greedy and lustful villain, sees Li Mei's beauty and talent as an opportunity to fulfill his desires. He wants to force Li Mei to be his mistress, but she refuses. This refusal fuels his vengeful nature and leads him to plot against her, adding another layer of complexity and danger to Li Mei's story.

By exploring the story from multiple perspectives, we gain a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations. This exercise also helps to identify potential areas of conflict and development in the narrative, ultimately creating a richer and more engaging story for the audience.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 110 The protagonist’s goal/objective

There are two most important items in the protagonist’s back-story: (a) their conscious needs, wants and desires (their active goal or objective), and (b) their unconscious needs, wants and desires (their dormant goal or objective). The motor of the play is when the two are in conflict. The out- come of the play will be the resolution of that conflict. Ask yourself the following questions:

1	What are your protagonist’s active and dormant goals/objectives?

2	How much of a potential threat is the dormant goal to the active goal?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's explore her active and dormant goals/objectives and their potential conflict:

1. What are your protagonist's active and dormant goals/objectives?

Active Goal/Objective: Li Mei's conscious desire is to become the top fashion designer in the city. She wants to break away from her small village's traditional expectations and make a name for herself in the world of fashion. This goal drives her actions and decisions throughout the story.

Dormant Goal/Objective: Li Mei's unconscious desire might be to gain her father's approval and maintain her close relationships with her friends and lover. Deep down, she may also yearn for the safety and security of her traditional upbringing, even though she actively pursues a more modern and ambitious path.

2. How much of a potential threat is the dormant goal to the active goal?

The dormant goal could pose a significant threat to Li Mei's active goal of becoming a successful fashion designer. Her unconscious desire for her father's approval and the comfort of her traditional village life may cause her to question her decisions or hold herself back from taking risks in her career. This inner conflict might lead to moments of self-doubt and hesitation, affecting her relationships and her pursuit of success.

As the story progresses, Li Mei will need to confront and resolve the conflict between her active and dormant goals. This could involve a pivotal moment where she must decide between pursuing her dreams or maintaining the safety and approval of her traditional background. The outcome of this conflict will ultimately shape Li Mei's character arc and the overall narrative of the story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 111 The First Major Turning Point

The First Major Turning Point is where the protagonist’s dormant goal/objective makes itself known. The active goal is challenged and the status quo is threatened or changed. This is now the driving force behind the play, and the main action begins here. From this moment, expectations are raised in the audience as to the outcome of the play. Ask yourself the following questions:

1	Where and how does the First Major Turning Point occur in your play?

2	Does it happen in a manner that is believable and appropriate to that world?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze the First Major Turning Point and its credibility:

1. Where and how does the First Major Turning Point occur in your play?

The First Major Turning Point occurs when Li Mei's fashion designs catch the attention of the corrupted official, Liu Taibao. Until this point, Li Mei has been working hard to establish herself as a fashion designer, driven by her active goal. However, when Liu Taibao tries to force her into becoming his mistress in exchange for his support and resources, Li Mei's dormant goal of gaining her father's approval and maintaining her relationships becomes challenged.

This turning point threatens the status quo and sets the main action into motion. Li Mei is now faced with a moral dilemma: should she compromise her values for the sake of her dreams, or stand her ground and risk losing the opportunity for success? This conflict highlights the tension between her active and dormant goals and raises the stakes for the audience.

2. Does it happen in a manner that is believable and appropriate to that world?

Yes, the First Major Turning Point is both believable and appropriate to the world of the play. In a society where corruption, power dynamics, and traditional values are prevalent, it is plausible for a character like Liu Taibao to wield his influence to get what he wants. Moreover, the stakes are high for Li Mei, who is trying to navigate the complex and competitive world of fashion while maintaining her integrity and relationships.

The turning point also reinforces the themes of ambition, moral choices, and the struggle for self-identity, making it a fitting and dramatic event in Li Mei's story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 112 The major conflicts of the story

The major conflicts in the story are given expression through the journey of the protagonist. These may operate on any or all of the following levels: the inner world (head, heart and soul), the immediate outer world (family, lovers, etc.), the wider social world (teachers, colleagues, etc.), the institutional world (police, professions, etc.), the historical     or geographical circumstances of the world. Ask yourself the following questions:

1	What levels of conflict are depicted in your play?

2	Where and how are these expressed in the action?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze the major conflicts and how they are expressed in the play:

1. What levels of conflict are depicted in your play?

a) Inner world (head, heart, and soul): Li Mei struggles with the decision to either maintain her integrity and risk her dream or accept Liu Taibao's proposition to secure her success as a fashion designer. This inner conflict highlights her morals, desires, and the struggle for self-identity.

Exercise 113 The protagonist under pressure

The choices the protagonist makes under pressure reveal deep character. The pressure is  the  developing  conflict  between  the  conscious  and the unconscious. The greater the pressure, the deeper is the revelation   of character. The events that flow from the increasing pressure on the protagonist provide the spine of the story. These  events  can  be  depicted as obstacles, reversals of fortune, strokes of luck, loss of nerve,  a bold move, being thrown off-course, etc. Ask yourself the following questions:

1	Where do such events occur in your play?

2	Which are the major moments of pressure in which deep character is revealed?

3	Which are the incidental moments of pressure?

Exercise 114 Events as change

Each event is a moment of change: of mind, heart, conscience, circum- stance, fortune, etc. The greater the crisis around the event, the greater the value (moral or material) of the change. As a general principle, as the story unfolds the stakes get higher. Ask yourself the following questions:

1	What is the progression of events?

2	If 1 is low pressure and 10 is high pressure, where would you place each event on the scale of 1–10?

3	As the story unfolds, the stakes get higher. Does the progression of events in your play reflect the increasing value of the changes taking place?

Exercise 115 The final outcome

From the First Major Turning Point, expectations have been raised in the audience as to the outcome. As the events evolve those expectations develop. The final outcome  of  the  play  is  the  biggest  change  of  all. Everything has been put in place to support it. However surprising, shocking, delightful or unexpected it is, it must be appropriately believable to the events leading up to it. Ask yourself the following questions:

1	Does your protagonist achieve what she thinks she wants, or what she really needs, or what she doesn’t desire?

2	Does she achieve it in a manner that is satisfying and appropriate to the journey the audience has been following?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze the final outcome and whether it is satisfying and appropriate to the journey the audience has been following:

1. Does your protagonist achieve what she thinks she wants, or what she really needs, or what she doesn't desire?

Li Mei achieves not only what she thinks she wants, which is to become a top fashion designer in the city, but also what she really needs: personal growth, independence, and the strength to stand up against adversity. In refusing Liu Taibao's advances and overcoming the obstacles he creates, Li Mei demonstrates her integrity and resilience. These experiences further enrich her character and contribute to her success in the fashion world.

2. Does she achieve it in a manner that is satisfying and appropriate to the journey the audience has been following?

Yes, Li Mei's journey is satisfying and appropriate for the audience. Throughout the story, the audience witnesses Li Mei's personal and professional growth as she navigates the challenges of the city, forms supportive relationships, and confronts her adversaries. Her success as a fashion designer is hard-won, and her determination to remain true to her values makes her triumph even more rewarding. As the story progresses, Li Mei's experiences shape her into a stronger, more resilient person, making her ultimate success not only believable but also deeply satisfying for the audience.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 116 All the other characters

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Outcome

By addressing the questions above, you will have begun to consider where and how your first draft needs to be restructured, tightened and clarified. We have also seen that change is constantly happening, as the conflict between the conscious and unconscious of the protagonist develops.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the outcome for each character is connected to their individual journeys and the changes they experience as a result of the conflict between their conscious and unconscious desires. The development of these conflicts drives the story forward, resulting in both positive and negative changes for the characters.

For example, Li Jilai, Li Mei's strict father, initially wants to protect his daughter and maintain traditional values. Throughout the story, his perspective on Li Mei's ambitions shifts as he witnesses her determination, talent, and resilience. His unconscious desire is to see his daughter happy and successful, even if it means letting go of some of his traditional beliefs. As the story progresses, Li Jilai learns to respect Li Mei's aspirations, which results in a deepened understanding and acceptance of her dreams. This change in Li Jilai's mindset is the outcome of his character arc.

Another example is Liu Taibao, the corrupt official and antagonist of the story. His conscious goal is to possess Li Mei and take revenge on her for refusing his advances. However, his unconscious desire may be to maintain his power and control over others. As the story unfolds, the conflict between Li Mei and Liu Taibao escalates, leading to a series of events that eventually result in Liu Taibao's downfall. He is exposed for his corruption and faces the consequences of his actions, while Li Mei triumphs over his attempts at revenge. This outcome is a direct result of the change in the characters' dynamics and the resolution of the conflict between their conscious and unconscious desires.

By examining the outcomes for each character, you can identify areas in your first draft where the story needs to be restructured, tightened, or clarified. This process will also help you understand how the changes occurring within the characters, driven by the conflict between their conscious and unconscious desires, contribute to the development of the story. Through this analysis, you can create a more engaging and cohesive narrative that effectively explores the complexity of human desires and motivations.

Li Mei, Hangzhou Poet

user: use this technique, to write a story of Li mei, who is a girl living in hangzhou,china.

I read and read and read and I get into this fury of language, and it’s ...the highest caliber of language. And I know when I start to write, I’m not gonna step down below this. —Werner Herzog

Herzog challenges the traditional three-act structure taught

in film schools and says it leads to mediocre and predictable films. Herzog emphasizes writing with a sense of urgency. Not necessarily at great speed or with time constraints, but with a focus on dedicating time to recording the thoughts and pictures as they arrive in your mind. Don't dwell. Write!

Werner's writing is very disciplined, to the point where he tries to never erase a single word once he writes it down. Use this type of urgency and precision to increase the quality of your own writing.

Herzog talks about “psyching” himself up with poetry and music before he writes. He cites the works of Virgil, a Roman poet, as an example that leads to his highest caliber of writing. You can read a translation of one of Virgil's pieces, The Georgics

assistant: In the city of Hangzhou, where the ancient canals intertwine like a beautiful silken web, there lived a young girl named Li Mei. With the world pulsing around her, she felt as if she were the beating heart of the city, breathing life into its every crevice. The air was thick with the scent of jasmine and magnolia, mingling with the heady aroma of freshly brewed tea.

Li Mei would spend her mornings traversing the bustling markets, her laughter ringing through the stalls like the sweetest of melodies. The market sellers would eagerly share their stories with her, each tale a colorful tapestry woven from the threads of their own lives. As she listened, Li Mei felt a surge of inspiration rise within her, a wellspring of creativity that threatened to overflow.

Her afternoons were dedicated to a sacred ritual: Li Mei would retreat to her family's ancestral home, an ancient building adorned with intricate wood carvings that whispered of a time long past. There, perched atop the highest windowsill, she would unleash the torrent of thoughts and emotions that had built up within her throughout the day. With urgency and precision, she would pour her soul onto the pages of her delicate rice paper journals, her brush dancing and swirling as if possessed by the spirits of the great poets who had come before her.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting its golden hues across the city, Li Mei would immerse herself in the works of the great poets. She would lose herself in the verses of Virgil, the words cascading over her like a waterfall, washing away the worries of the day and igniting a fire within her heart. The night air, heavy with the songs of cicadas, would wrap itself around her like a lover's embrace as she crafted her own verses, each line a testament to the indomitable spirit of the human soul.

Li Mei's poetry soon became the talk of Hangzhou. Her words carried with them the essence of the city, the dreams and aspirations of its people woven into every stanza. It was said that her poetry could make flowers bloom and the stars dance in the heavens, such was the power of her verse.

But Li Mei never sought fame or fortune; she simply wished to share her love for Hangzhou and its people. With each poem she penned, she wove a thread into the tapestry of the city's soul, a vibrant and eternal testament to the beauty of life.

And so it was, in the ancient city of Hangzhou, that a young girl named Li Mei captured the hearts of its people with her words. In her hands, she held the power to ignite the passions of a city and to inspire generations to come. With urgency and precision, she wrote her way into the annals of history, leaving behind a legacy that would echo through the ages.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example in the context of Li mei's story. Li Mei is a girl living in hangzhou china. She struggles from a village girl to a top fashion designer in Hang Zhou.

STRUCTURE 1: IMPARTING INFORMATION

Exposition: the opening part of a play or a story, in which we are introduced to the characters and their situation.

We have already looked at ways in which the protagonists  are  introduced to us at the start of a play. What the playwright is doing is ‘exposing’ those things about the characters and their situation that will help the audience engage with the story  at  this  point.  However,  there  may be other key ‘facts’ that are not directly about the characters, but which the writer needs to let the audience know. These relate to ‘the world of the play’.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, as she transforms from a village girl to a top fashion designer in Hangzhou, the structure of imparting information through exposition is crucial to immerse the audience in the world of the play and understand the characters' motivations and challenges.

Exposition:

The story begins in a small village on the outskirts of Hangzhou, where Li Mei, a young and ambitious girl, lives with her family. Li Mei's passion for fashion and design is evident from the beginning, as she constantly sketches clothing designs in her notebook and dreams of creating beautiful garments that would make people feel confident and unique.

Her family, while supportive of her dreams, is concerned about the challenges that Li Mei would face in the competitive world of fashion. The exposition introduces the key characters in Li Mei's life, such as her parents, her siblings, and her best friend, who all play a role in her journey to becoming a successful designer.

Example:

As the story unfolds, the audience learns about the world of the play, which includes the cultural and social landscape of Hangzhou and the fashion industry. The writer can incorporate scenes where Li Mei visits the city, marveling at the grandeur and elegance of the boutiques and fashion houses that line the streets. This would serve to illustrate the contrast between her village life and the world she aspires to be a part of.

Through exposition, the audience would also be informed of the challenges and hardships faced by those who pursue a career in fashion design. For instance, the writer could include a scene where Li Mei attends a fashion show and overhears experienced designers discussing the struggles they faced in the industry. This would provide context and emphasize the stakes involved in Li Mei's journey.

By incorporating these elements in the exposition, the writer successfully introduces the characters, establishes their motivations, and sets the stage for Li Mei's journey from a village girl to a top fashion designer in Hangzhou. The audience is now well-prepared to follow her story and engage with the challenges and triumphs that lie ahead.

user: do this exercise in the context of Li  mei's story please.

Exercise 79 Exposition – the world of the play

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Take a few plays – classic, modern classic, contemporary – and read their opening sequences.

2	Note those facts about the world of the play that the writer has dropped into the dialogue.

3	Note the different techniques the writers use.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze the opening sequences of three plays – a classic, a modern classic, and a contemporary play – to identify how the writers impart exposition about the world of the play.

1. Classic Play: "A Doll's House" by Henrik Ibsen

Opening Sequence:

The play opens with a scene in the Helmers' home, where Nora and her husband Torvald are talking. Through their conversation, we learn about the Helmers' financial situation and their family dynamics.

Facts about the world of the play:

- The play is set in 19th-century Norway.

- Nora and Torvald have a rigid and traditional relationship, with Torvald exerting control over Nora's actions.

- The societal expectations and gender roles are clearly defined.

Technique:

Ibsen uses dialogue between the characters to reveal their relationships and societal norms. He subtly inserts information about the world they live in without making it sound like exposition.

2. Modern Classic Play: "Death of a Salesman" by Arthur Miller

Opening Sequence:

The play starts with Willy Loman, a traveling salesman, returning home after a failed sales trip. His wife, Linda, and their two sons, Biff and Happy, are introduced as they discuss Willy's deteriorating mental state and their struggling family situation.

Facts about the world of the play:

- The play is set in post-WWII America, with a focus on the American Dream.

- Willy Loman represents the common man's struggle for success and validation.

- The Loman family is financially strained, and their relationships are strained as well.

Technique:

Arthur Miller employs dialogue and interactions between the characters to reveal the world of the play. He also incorporates stage directions and descriptions of the setting to provide additional context.

3. Contemporary Play: "The Wolves" by Sarah DeLappe

Opening Sequence:

The play begins with a teenage girls' soccer team warming up before a game. The girls discuss various topics, including current events, their personal lives, and the sport they're playing, which gradually reveals their individual personalities and the world they live in.

Facts about the world of the play:

- The play is set in contemporary America.

- The teenage girls navigate the complexities of adolescence, friendship, and competition.

- The world of the play is centered around the girls' soccer team, their interpersonal relationships, and the pressures they face.

Technique:

DeLappe uses naturalistic dialogue and overlapping conversations to reveal the world of the play. The characters' discussions and interactions provide insight into their lives and the context of their world.

Applying these techniques to Li Mei's story, the writer could use dialogue and interactions between the characters to provide information about the world of the play, such as the cultural landscape of Hangzhou, the contrast between village life and city life, and the challenges of the fashion industry. By incorporating subtle exposition, the writer can create an immersive and engaging experience for the audience.

user: combine the four examples together to write a story for Li mei

Example 79.1 Romeo and Juliet

This is exposition at its baldest. A prologue of fourteen  lines  is  spoken, in which the whole story is told and the whole world of the play revealed.

Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life’ Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parent’s strife.

The fearful passage of their death-marked love, And the continuance of their parent’ rage,

Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;

The which if you with patient ears attend,

What here shall miss, our toil will strive to mend.

This style of exposition does away entirely with the need for the audience to discover what happens. It tells us what will happen, so focussing us totally on how it happens.

Example 79.2 Macbeth

In the first two scenes – before we meet our ‘first combatant’ – we learn a number of things about the world of the play:

●	It has supernatural dimensions, in the form of witches.

●	There has been a great and bloody battle between the Scottish king’s forces and those of the rebels, who are supported by the Norwegians.

●	The thane of Cawdor has been a major rebel.

●	The forces of the king have won the day, largely thanks to Macbeth, and the Norwegian king must pay ‘ten thousand dollars’ to the victors before he can bury his dead.

●	Cawdor is to be put to death.

Here we have a broad canvas, on which a world of feudal brutality and supernatural creatures is depicted. In these two scenes we are told about what has just happened. It seems that everything has been put to rights, the good have been rewarded and the bad have got their just resorts. But what about those witches ...?

Example 79.3 The Seagull

In the scene with Medvedenko and Masha we not only learn about them (from what they say about themselves and each other), but are also given the low-down on two of the major protagonists, Nina and Konstantin. Chekhov has set the scene in the grounds of an estate, and in the back- ground is a makeshift stage. There are some workmen in the background, completing the stage. We learn the following:

●	There’s going to be a play happening very soon.

●	Konstantin has written the play.

●	Nina will act in the play.

●	Nina and Konstantin are in love.

Here we are being told what is going to happen next. We are also invited into a world of some wealth and privilege, with a smattering of ‘the arts’ thrown in.

Example 79.4 Death of a Salesman

In a previous exercise we looked at everything we learned about Willy, from what he said about himself and what Linda said about him. This is a scene with an enormous amount of information in it, and from our knowl- edge of Willy alone, we are given a detailed picture of his world. As the dialogue moves along though, Arthur Miller fleshes out the picture of his domestic world: this is not just this travelling salesman, it is the travelling salesman who lives in this house in this neighbourhood:

●	Building developments have boxed the house in, so that even with the windows open there is no air.

●	The street is lined with cars, there’s no fresh air in the neighbourhood. The grass in the yard doesn’t grow anymore.

●	The builders cut the trees down.

●	There used to be lilac, wisteria, peonies and daffodils growing, but these days not even a carrot would grow in the yard.

●	The smell from apartments invades the house.

Here we are being invited to imagine what was in comparison to what is. This is the physical arena in which Willy’s story unfolds, as it was once and as it is now.

assistant: In the story of Li Mei, we can employ the exposition techniques from the four examples to create a rich and engaging narrative.

Opening Prologue (Inspired by Romeo and Juliet):

In the bustling city of Hangzhou, where tradition meets modernity,

A humble village girl with dreams, in a world of disparity,

Li Mei, gifted with passion, strives for the fashion throne,

As she navigates a new path, leaving her simple life alone.

Through trials and tribulations, she'll claim her destiny,

Facing the competitive world with courage and artistry.

With each stitch and design, she'll break through the walls,

Witness the journey of Li Mei, as her dream finally calls.

Act I - Introducing the World (Inspired by Macbeth):

In the opening scene, Li Mei is seen sketching designs in her small village, surrounded by the simplicity of rural life. A group of elderly women gather nearby, sharing stories of talented individuals who ventured into the city, hinting at the supernatural elements that influenced their success.

The scene shifts to the city, revealing the competitive nature of the fashion industry and the complexity of the world Li Mei is about to enter. The current top designers are seen discussing their rise to fame and the challenges they faced, setting the stage for Li Mei's own journey.

Act II - The Play and Romance (Inspired by The Seagull):

In the city, Li Mei is invited to showcase her designs in a fashion show organized by her newfound friends. She works tirelessly on her creations, determined to impress the audience and make a name for herself. Meanwhile, Li Mei falls in love with a fellow designer, adding a romantic layer to her story.

The fashion show is a success, and Li Mei's talent is recognized. Her designs capture the hearts of the audience, and she gains the attention of influential figures in the fashion world.

Act III - The Transformation of Li Mei's World (Inspired by Death of a Salesman):

As Li Mei's success in the fashion industry grows, her world transforms drastically. The contrast between her rural upbringing and the glamour of Hangzhou's fashion scene is highlighted. The city's development encroaches upon the natural beauty that once inspired her, and she faces the pressures of maintaining her success and remaining true to her roots.

In the end, Li Mei finds a way to merge her heritage and newfound fame, creating designs that honor her background while embracing the modernity of Hangzhou's fashion world. The story concludes with Li Mei rising to the top of the fashion industry, staying true to herself and her village, and proving that dreams can come true with determination and hard work.

user: Ok, adapt the following example to Li mei's story please.

Example 79.5 Attempts on her Life

In a previous exercise we looked at how hard facts (or what seem to be hard facts) about Anne are delivered in the first scene. We also noted that the very structure of the scene – a sequence of seemingly unconnected telephone messages – gave us a picture of a fragmented world of electronic communication. In terms of the wider world of the story, what other clues has the writer planted into the messages:

●	This world embraces a number of (possible) places: Vienna, Prague, Minnesota, airports.

●	This is a world in which intimate words (crude or sincere) and thoughts are received through anonymous machines.

●	This is a world where the identity of the protagonist is constantly shifting, depending on the individual speaking to her through the machine.

You could call this anti-exposition, the polar opposite to the prologue in Romeo and Juliet. We are presented with a world where nothing can be taken at face value. We think we ‘know’ something about the protagonist, through the words of one caller, then all seems contradicted when the next caller comes on line. In its language and its references, this is the contemporary world we inhabit. Of all the plays we have looked at, it should present the most familiar world to us. However, in its evasiveness, it feels the least familiar, which is why it is so brilliant. It takes the world we think we know and exposes it as something utterly unknowable. Even the strange, bloody and supernatural world of Macbeth seems more solid than the shifting sands of the modern, techno-fragmented world of Attempts on her Life.

assistant: Example 79.5 - Li Mei's Shifting World

In a scene inspired by "Attempts on her Life," Li Mei finds herself in the midst of an ever-changing world as her career progresses. As she interacts with people from different cities and backgrounds, her perception of herself and her environment begins to shift.

The scene begins with Li Mei receiving a series of messages from people she's met along her journey. Some messages come from her hometown, while others are from places she has visited, such as Paris, New York, and Tokyo. These messages convey various emotions, ranging from admiration and support to jealousy and criticism.

This world embraces a number of (possible) places: Hangzhou, Paris, New York, Tokyo, and more.

This is a world in which intimate words (crude or sincere) and thoughts are received through anonymous machines, such as social media and emails.

This is a world where the identity of the protagonist is constantly shifting, depending on the individual speaking to her through the machine.

In this scene, Li Mei's world becomes a reflection of the contemporary, globalized society we live in, where identities and perceptions are constantly changing. Each message she receives offers a different perspective on her life and achievements, highlighting the fragmented nature of her world.

As the scene unfolds, Li Mei begins to question her own identity and the world she inhabits. The messages force her to confront the complexities of her newfound fame and the challenges she faces in maintaining her sense of self amid a world that seems to have an ever-changing opinion of her.

This adaptation presents Li Mei's world as a reflection of our own modern, techno-fragmented reality, where nothing is as stable as it seems, and the protagonist must navigate the shifting sands of perception and identity. Through this scene, the story of Li Mei exposes the challenges of living in a constantly changing world and the struggles of remaining true to oneself.

user: please write a story of li mei based on the following example.

Example 79.6 Little Red and other tales

Look at any folk or fairy tale and you will find the same elements featured in the exposition: (a) specific protagonists with distinct character-features and (b) a specific world for the character to move in.

There was once upon a time a little country girl, born in a village, the prettiest little creature that ever was seen. Her mother was beyond reason excessively fond of her, and her grandmother yet much more. This good woman caused to be made for her a little red riding-hood; which made her look so very pretty, that everybody called her, the Little Red Riding hood. One day, her mother said to her . . .

(Iona and Peter Opie. The Classic Fairy Tales)

Once there was an old boatman who lived in a little hut on the banks of the holy River Ganges. For many, many years his family had rowed boats across the great river. His grandfather and his father had been boatmen before him; and our friend had taken over the job when he was just a boy. Like all the villagers he was poor. The money he made rowing people from one bank to the other could scarcely feed his family. But although life was hard he never grumbled. He was happy to be of service to his passengers. One day, a well-dressed city gentleman climbed into his boat . . .

(Beulah Candeppa. Tales of South Asia)

Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife. The old man was of a kindly nature and had a pet sparrow which, since he was childless, he treated as tenderly as if it had been his own child. One day the old man took a basket and a hatchet in his hand and went as usual to the mountains to cut firewood. The old woman in the mean- time began to wash clothes at the well . . .

(Iwaya Sazanami. Japanese Fairy Tales)

There was a man long ago living near Ballaghadereen named Owen O’Mulready, who was a workman for the gentleman of the place, and was a prosperous, quiet, contented man. There was no one but him- self and his wife Margaret, and they had a nice little house and enough potatoes in the year, in addition to their share of wages, from their master. There wasn’t a want or anxiety on Owen, except one desire, and that was to have a dream – for he had never had one. One day, when he was digging potatoes . . .

(Joseph Jacobs. Celtic Fairy Tales)

assistant: Example 79.6 - Li Mei's Journey

Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Hangzhou, there lived a young girl named Li Mei. She was born and raised in a humble village on the outskirts of the city, and her natural beauty and grace captivated all who met her. Li Mei's parents worked tirelessly to provide for their family, but they always encouraged Li Mei to pursue her dreams and passions.

Li Mei's grandmother was a skilled seamstress, and she passed her knowledge and love for fashion onto her granddaughter. Under her grandmother's watchful eye, Li Mei learned to create beautiful garments from simple fabrics. As she grew older, her talents blossomed, and her dream of becoming a top fashion designer in Hangzhou seemed within reach.

One day, Li Mei's mother, aware of her daughter's potential, encouraged Li Mei to venture into the city and present her designs to a renowned fashion house. With a mixture of excitement and fear, Li Mei gathered her portfolio and embarked on her journey to the heart of Hangzhou's fashion scene.

Upon arriving in the city, Li Mei was overwhelmed by the dazzling lights, towering skyscrapers, and the hustle and bustle of urban life. Undeterred, she navigated the crowded streets and eventually found herself at the doorstep of the prestigious fashion house.

As Li Mei hesitantly entered the elegant building, she was met with skepticism from the fashionable elite who looked down upon her modest village attire. However, her determination and unwavering belief in her own talent caught the attention of a prominent designer named Mr. Zhou.

Mr. Zhou, curious about the young girl from the village, took a chance and decided to mentor Li Mei. Under his guidance, Li Mei refined her skills and developed a unique style that blended traditional Chinese elements with modern design sensibilities.

Li Mei's hard work and dedication did not go unnoticed. Soon, her designs were featured in prominent fashion shows and magazines, earning her widespread acclaim and admiration. Her once modest village background became a symbol of her humble beginnings and a testament to her incredible journey.

As Li Mei's fame grew, so did the challenges she faced. The pressures of success and the ever-changing world of fashion threatened to overwhelm her. But through it all, Li Mei remained true to herself and the values instilled in her by her family.

In time, Li Mei became a top fashion designer in Hangzhou, defying expectations and proving that even a simple village girl could achieve greatness. Her story serves as an inspiration to all who dare to dream and follow their passions, no matter the obstacles they face along the way.

Outcome

With the examples I have used, and others you may have chosen, we have seen that the function of the exposition is to prepare the ground, by introducing the protagonist(s) and their world. Within this, some form of future dilemma, problem or question is raised (whether explicitly or just

hinted at). Whatever the case, the writer has carefully chosen which facts from the back-story to expose. We have seen how this can be done by spilling all the beans at once (Romeo and Juliet) or by holding the cards very close to the chest (Attempts on her Life), and everything else in between. Death of a Salesman is a good example of how the modern ‘well-made play’ delivers its exposition – by enfolding the information very cleverly into the dialogue: we are receiving a huge amount of ‘facts’ without being aware of it.

assistant: Outcome Assessment for Li Mei's Story:

In Li Mei's story, we have effectively used exposition to introduce our protagonist and her world. The readers get a sense of Li Mei's humble beginnings, her passion for fashion, and her dream of becoming a top fashion designer in Hangzhou.

Exercise 80 An opening passage

Participants: All groups, individual

You are going to write three opening passages for a play. In them you will be introducing your protagonist. Nothing hugely dramatic should happen, but you have to include a number of expositional ‘facts’ that the audience needs to know. The task is to insert them craftily, in such a way that the audience is not sitting there thinking, ‘Oh we’re being spoon-fed the facts.’ Here are the ‘facts’ about the characters and the basic situation. Having done all the previous work on character, change and subtext, bring as much of that into the exercise as is useful. By now you should be adept at summoning up characters and situations quite speedily.

1	She went to college to study fine art. She likes the colour red. Her father died when she was eight years old. The college she studied at was a hotbed of left-wing politics. Write this as her side of a telephone conversation.

2	He was a singer in a college rock-band. He failed to complete the college course. He is overweight. He spoke at her mother’s funeral. Write this as two people who are talking about him (he is not present).

3	She lived abroad for several years. While she was abroad there was civil unrest in her homeland. While she was abroad she met up with an old friend. She reads detective novels. She returned home as the successful executive for a large corporation. Write this as a dialogue over dinner.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's write three opening passages for a play, introducing her character and incorporating the given facts:

1. (Li Mei's side of a telephone conversation)

Li Mei: Hey, Xiao Chen! Yeah, I was just going through some of my old art from college. You know how much I loved studying fine art. (Pauses) Oh, I always had a thing for the color red, so you'll see a lot of it in my work. (Pauses) Yeah, my dad passed away when I was eight, so he never got to see my art. (Pauses) You remember our college, right? It was always buzzing with left-wing politics. (Pauses) Anyway, I'll see you soon. Take care!

2. (Two people talking about Li Mei, who is not present)

Person A: You know Li Mei, right? She was the lead singer in that college rock band.

Person B: Oh, I remember her. She didn't complete her course, though, did she?

Person A: No, she didn't. She struggled with her weight and faced some health issues. But she was a great singer.

Person B: I heard she spoke at her mother's funeral. Must've been tough.

Person A: Yeah, it was. But her speech was beautiful and heartfelt.

3. (A dialogue over dinner)

Friend 1: So, Li Mei, tell us about your time abroad.

Li Mei: I lived in Europe for a few years. It was quite an experience, especially with all the civil unrest happening back home in China.

Friend 2: Did you make any new friends while you were there?

Li Mei: Actually, I ran into an old friend from school. We ended up spending a lot of time together, discussing detective novels and reminiscing about the past.

Friend 1: And now you're back as a successful executive for a major fashion corporation. That's quite a journey!

Li Mei: Yes, it's been quite the adventure, and I'm grateful for every step of it.

user: Exercise 81 A prologue

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Find a news-story from the daily paper.

2	Imagine you are going to write a full play based on the story.

3	Write a prologue in which, as with Romeo and Juliet, you give the bare bones of the whole story, laying out what will happen to the characters, but not how it will happen.

assistant: 1. News-story from the daily paper: "Village girl Li Mei becomes a top fashion designer in Hangzhou."

2. Imagine a full play based on Li Mei's journey from her humble beginnings to her success in the fashion industry.

3. Prologue:

Once upon a time in Hangzhou's embrace,

A tale unfolds of struggle and grace.

A village girl, named Li Mei, she stood,

With dreams of fashion and life in the hood.

In humble beginnings, she toiled and strived,

To make her mark and come alive.

From modest roots and a life of strife,

Li Mei fought to change her life.

In this tale, a journey unfolds,

Of Li Mei's path to dreams untold.

Through hardship and trials, she'll rise above,

To find her place in a world she'll come to love.

Watch as her story takes its flight,

From village girl to designer's delight.

Though we share her destination clear,

The twists and turns are yet to appear.

So lend us your ears and follow her quest,

As Li Mei puts her passion to the test.

In Hangzhou's arms, she'll find her way,

And claim her success in the world of the day.

user: Exercise 82 Character from Chapter 4

Participants: All groups, individual

Go back to the character and story-idea you were working on in Chapter 4. You wrote an opening scene, and it contained at least two characters. Consider everything we have done so far regarding opening scenes and their function. Rewrite the scene, bearing in mind the following:

1	What do we learn about the characters in terms of (a) what they      say about themselves and (b) what the other characters say about them?

2	What change(s) takes place for the characters in terms of their situation?

3	How is the world of the play revealed?

4	How is subtext dealt with; how much is revealed by what is not said, half-said, alluded to and hinted at?

5	What questions does the scene summon up (consciously or otherwise) in the minds of the audience?

assistant: In Chapter 4, we developed a story-idea about Li Mei, a village girl who becomes a top fashion designer in Hangzhou. The opening scene featured Li Mei and her best friend, Xiao Lan, discussing Li Mei's big opportunity to move to the city and pursue her dream.

Rewritten Opening Scene:

(Li Mei and Xiao Lan sit on a bench in their village, watching the sunset.)

Xiao Lan: (excited) Li Mei, I can't believe you got accepted into that prestigious design school in Hangzhou! You must be over the moon!

Li Mei: (nervous) Yes, I am excited, but also scared, Xiao Lan. I've never been away from our village, and I'll be leaving everything I've ever known behind.

Xiao Lan: (supportive) But you've always been so talented, and everyone in the village admires your creativity. You've made the most beautiful dresses for our festivals, and now it's time for the rest of the world to see your gift.

Li Mei: (sighs) My mother worries about me going to the city. She says it's a different world out there, and she's afraid I won't be able to adapt. Sometimes, I worry she might be right.

Xiao Lan: (smiling) Li Mei, remember when we were kids, and you made that red dress for my birthday? Even though we didn't have much, you always found a way to create beauty from the simplest things. You're strong and resourceful. The city won't defeat you.

Li Mei: (smiles) Thank you, Xiao Lan. You've always been my biggest supporter. I just hope I can make everyone proud, especially my late father. I know he'd want me to chase my dreams.

Xiao Lan: (grabs Li Mei's hand) I know you'll succeed, Li Mei. Just promise me that no matter how famous you become, you'll always remember our little village and the friendship we share.

Li Mei: (tears up) I promise, Xiao Lan. You'll always be in my heart.

(Scene fades as they watch the sun dip below the horizon.)

In this revised scene, we learn the following:

1. Li Mei is nervous but excited about her opportunity. Xiao Lan is supportive and admires Li Mei's talent.

2. The change taking place for Li Mei is her transition from village life to city life, where she will face new challenges.

3. The world of the play is revealed through the conversation about the village and the city, highlighting the contrast between the two environments.

4. Subtext is revealed through Li Mei's fears and her late father's influence, hinting at the emotional journey she will experience.

5. The scene raises questions about Li Mei's ability to adapt to city life, her pursuit of her dreams, and whether her success will change her relationship with her village and Xiao Lan.

user: Exercise 83 Unpacking the suitcase

Participants: All groups, individual

We have discussed exposition as happening at the start of the play, but that is not the whole of it. In Chapter 4, we saw how the whole life history of the protagonist(s) needs to be in place before the story begins. It was as if you were packing a suitcase full of the character’s whole existence and world and then, in scene one, deciding which items to take out and expose to the audience. But it does not finish there, for as you go along there will be other items in the suitcase that you will need to reveal to the audience at key moments in the play. So exposition continues – on different levels – throughout the play.

Look at a range of plays (or TV soap operas and dramas) and see how the writer has ‘gone back to the suitcase’ at certain points, to push the story

forward and deepen our understanding of the protagonist(s). What devices and techniques have they used?

assistant: In this exercise, we'll analyze plays, TV soap operas, and dramas to see how writers "go back to the suitcase" and reveal more about the protagonist(s) throughout the story. We'll discuss different techniques and devices used to expose character details and move the plot forward.

1. Flashbacks: Flashbacks are a common technique used in both plays and on-screen dramas to reveal important past events or character details. For example, in the play "Death of a Salesman" by Arthur Miller, flashbacks are used to show Willy Loman's past experiences, his relationship with his family, and his career struggles.

2. Monologues: Characters may deliver monologues, revealing their inner thoughts, feelings, and background information. In the play "A Streetcar Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams, Blanche DuBois's monologues provide insight into her past and her mental state.

3. Dialogues: Through conversations between characters, writers can reveal essential information about a protagonist's past or their motivations. In the TV drama "Breaking Bad," Walter White's dialogues with other characters uncover his reasons for turning to a life of crime and the complexities of his relationships.

4. Letters or diaries: Characters may discover letters, diaries, or other written materials that reveal crucial details about a protagonist's past or intentions. In the play "The Glass Menagerie" by Tennessee Williams, the character Tom reads a letter from his father, which offers insight into the family's history.

5. Visual cues: In TV dramas and movies, visual cues can hint at a character's past or personality traits. For example, in the TV series "Mad Men," Don Draper's office decorations and personal items provide subtle hints about his background and interests.

6. Actions and choices: A character's actions and decisions throughout the story can reveal crucial information about their motivations, values, and past experiences. In the play "Hamlet" by William Shakespeare, Hamlet's choices and actions expose his internal struggle and his thoughts about revenge, justice, and morality.

By analyzing these different techniques, we can see how playwrights and screenwriters carefully reveal more about the protagonist(s) throughout the story, enriching the audience's understanding of the character(s) and propelling the plot forward.

user: analyze this example please.

Examples 83.1

●	In a melodrama (a type of sensational drama, with rather two- dimensional characters, popular in nineteenth-century Europe and America), the use of ‘big, dramatic revelation’ was common. The curtain on Act 1 might come down on a line such as, ‘But Sir Roger, your long-lost father has been locked in the attic for these past fifty years!’ Crude as this might seem, it tells us exactly what exposition is: those things that are brought in from the past lives of the prota- gonists to affect the on-stage action.

●	When Macbeth seems to be faltering in his resolve to murder the king, Lady Macbeth reveals something about her own history to prove how much her own determination should spur him on:

I have given suck, and know How tender ‘tis to love the babe that milks me:

I would, while it was smiling in my face,

Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums, And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this.

(Act 1, Scene 7)

●	Exposition arrives in all sort of forms: the arrival of messages with hitherto unknown but crucial information (letters, faxes, phone messages, etc.); ‘I remember’ speeches; flashbacks; the use of a nar- rator-figure; confessions; gossip; the arrival of the messenger to tell the king that the enemy are outside the walls.

●	Soap operas are practically all exposition. Note the way in which characters are continually sidling up to each other with the line, ‘Sid, can I, er, have a word with you about what happened last night . . .’ which is generally some bit of gossip about the shady goings on of one of the other characters.

assistant: In this example, several techniques for exposition are mentioned and illustrated. Let's analyze each of these techniques and how they contribute to revealing the backstory or character details:

1. Big, dramatic revelation: In melodramas, a sudden and surprising revelation about a character's past is often used to shock the audience and influence the story. Although this method might seem crude, it serves the purpose of exposition by exposing crucial information from the protagonist's past.

2. Character speeches: In Shakespeare's "Macbeth," Lady Macbeth reveals a significant aspect of her past through a speech, showing her determination and influencing Macbeth's actions. This technique is effective in providing insight into a character's motivations and mindset.

3. Various forms of exposition: The example mentions several methods for delivering exposition, such as messages with unknown information, "I remember" speeches, flashbacks, narrator figures, confessions, and gossip. These techniques allow the playwright to reveal essential details about the characters and their past, which can affect the on-stage action.

4. Soap operas: In this genre, almost every interaction between characters serves as exposition. Characters often share information about past events or gossip about other characters, which helps the audience understand the relationships and motivations of the characters involved.

Overall, these examples highlight different methods of exposition used in theater and television to reveal crucial information about the characters and their pasts. Each technique serves to enhance the audience's understanding of the characters, their motivations, and the story's development.

Exercise 7 I am writing

Participants: All groups, individual (3–5 minutes)

In Exercises 5 and 6 you were writing without thinking ahead. This time you will again be ‘just writing’, but there will be no numbers or pink elephants or given subjects.

1	You are going to write, but until you start you will have no idea what is going to come out.

2	Start with the words ‘I am writing . . . ’ and do not stop.

3	If you find that, even if only for a second, your mind feels blank, just write ‘I am writing, I am writing, I am writing . . . ’ until something else appears.

4	Don’t plan, don’t censor yourself, just write.

5	Ready, steady . . . go. (See Example 7.1.)

6	When you have finished, underline words, phrases and sentences that you particularly liked. (See Example 7.2.)

Example 7.1

Before starting work this morning – my first day on this book – I did this exercise myself. What came out was the following jumble, including the bad grammar and spelling:

I am writing because I am starting to write this book what is a book a book is something between hard covers no not that it can be between

papercovers and its called a paperback my back is aching at the moment so I’m nt looking forward to sitting at the machine and typ-  ing in fact my back is so bad I think I’ll have to lie down but I cant lie down because I have to carry on with this exercise for the book the book the book I cant think of oh yes I can . . . etc.

Example 7.2

From my own effort I liked the rhythm of ‘papercovers and its called a paperback my back’.

assistant: Exercise 7 is a creative writing exercise that encourages participants to write freely without any specific topic or constraint. It is designed to stimulate the flow of thoughts and ideas while bypassing the writer's internal censor. This exercise can be done individually or in groups and typically takes around 3-5 minutes to complete. The objective is to write continuously without stopping or planning, allowing the mind to express itself without any constraints.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Begin writing with the phrase "I am writing..." and let your thoughts flow freely.

2. If you experience a moment of writer's block, continue writing "I am writing, I am writing, I am writing..." until new ideas emerge.

3. Do not plan or censor your writing; just let the words flow.

4. Start the exercise and continue until you feel it's time to stop.

5. After completing the writing, underline words, phrases, or sentences that you particularly enjoyed or felt proud of.

Example 7.1 provides a sample of how the exercise might look when completed. The example demonstrates that the writing may be a mix of thoughts, emotions, and random ideas. It is not meant to be grammatically perfect or even coherent, but rather a free-flowing expression of the writer's mind.

Example 7.2 highlights the self-reflection aspect of the exercise. After completing the writing, the author identified a specific phrase they enjoyed: "papercovers and its called a paperback my back." This process of self-reflection can help writers identify their strengths and areas of interest.

In summary, Exercise 7 is a creative writing exercise that encourages participants to write freely and spontaneously without planning or censoring their thoughts. This exercise can help writers overcome writer's block, stimulate creative thinking, and allow for self-reflection.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

Even at this very simple stage of the process, we can learn to value quirkiness and originality in what we write, and to trust our instincts.

assistant: Outcome refers to the result or the lessons learned from participating in a specific activity or exercise. In the context of creative writing exercises like Exercise 7, the outcome is the development of an appreciation for quirkiness and originality in one's writing, as well as building trust in one's instincts.

Quirkiness and originality are essential components of engaging and compelling writing. They set a writer's work apart from others and make it memorable. By participating in free-flowing writing exercises, writers can discover their unique voice and style, which can help them create more captivating and distinctive pieces.

Trusting one's instincts is crucial in the writing process. Often, writers may second-guess or doubt their ideas, which can lead to writer's block or hesitation. By practicing exercises that focus on writing without planning or self-censorship, writers can learn to trust their instincts and allow their thoughts to flow more freely onto the page.

Example:

Let's consider an individual participating in Exercise 7. They start writing:

"I am writing about the strange little creature I saw in my garden today, it had four legs, two wings, and a shiny green shell. It danced around the flowers, humming a tune only it could hear. It seemed to have a message for me, but I couldn't understand its language. I felt a strong connection to this peculiar being, and it felt like we shared a secret only the two of us knew."

In this example, the writer has allowed their imagination to run free, describing a quirky and original scene involving a strange creature in their garden. This creative and unique piece of writing highlights the writer's ability to trust their instincts, letting their thoughts flow without self-censorship or doubt.

In conclusion, participating in creative writing exercises like Exercise 7 can lead to valuable outcomes such as learning to value quirkiness and originality in one's writing and trusting one's instincts. By practicing these skills, writers can develop their unique voice and style, making their work more engaging and memorable.

Exercise 8 Music and words

Participants: All groups, individual

Music and rhythm can provide an excellent stimulus to the writing process.

1	Close your eyes and listen to a piece of music for a few moments.

2	Let the music continue. Write a speech on a particular subject: war, peace, love, football, etc. Don’t plan ahead. Allow the music to filter into what you are writing, the words you use, etc.

assistant: Exercise 8, titled "Music and Words," is a creative writing exercise that involves using music as a source of inspiration for writing. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how music and rhythm can stimulate the writing process by influencing the tone, pacing, and language used in the piece. This exercise can be done individually or in groups.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Close your eyes and listen to a piece of music for a few moments. Choose any music that resonates with you or evokes a particular emotion.

2. While the music continues to play, write a speech on a specific subject, such as war, peace, love, or football. Do not plan ahead or try to control the direction of the speech. Instead, let the music influence your writing, shaping the words, tone, and style.

Example:

Imagine a participant listens to a soothing, peaceful piece of music and decides to write a speech about love. They begin writing:

"As I stand before you, my heart swells with a profound sense of love and unity. The gentle breeze whispers sweet nothings into our ears, reminding us of the delicate bonds that connect us all. Love, my dear friends, is the language of the soul, an eternal melody that resonates within each of us. It is a tender dance, a harmonious waltz that transcends time and space, weaving an intricate tapestry of emotions and experiences."

In this example, the writer has allowed the music's calming and serene qualities to influence their writing. The language used in the speech is poetic and flowing, with a rhythm that mirrors the music. The tone of the speech is gentle and reflective, demonstrating how music can effectively shape and inform the writing process.

In conclusion, Exercise 8 "Music and Words" highlights the power of music as a catalyst for creative writing. By allowing music to influence their writing, participants can create unique, emotionally resonant pieces that showcase the interconnected nature of music and language. This exercise can help writers explore new styles, tones, and themes while honing their ability to effectively convey emotions and ideas through their writing.

1	I am a wizard and in a moment I will make all the words that exist in the world disappear except four words.

2	Choose the four words you are going to save and write them down.

3	I am a wizard and I have decided to be generous – you can keep four more words.

4	Choose them and write them down.

5	You now have eight words and they will soon be the only eight words in the world. If you turn those eight words into a poem, then all the other words will be saved.

6	You can repeat words if it helps the poem, but you can only use those eight.

assistant: Exercise 10, titled "Instant Poem," is a creative writing exercise that challenges participants to create a poem using a limited set of words. This exercise can be done individually or in groups and typically takes 2-3 minutes to complete. The purpose of this exercise is to encourage writers to think creatively and practice concise expression, focusing on the power and impact of individual words.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Imagine that you are a wizard, and in a moment, you will make all the words in the world disappear except for four words.

2. Choose the four words you want to save and write them down.

3. As a wizard, you decide to be generous and allow yourself to keep four more words.

4. Choose these additional four words and write them down.

5. You now have eight words, which will soon be the only words in the world. To save all the other words, you must turn these eight words into a poem.

6. You can repeat words in the poem if necessary, but you can only use the eight words you selected.

Example:

1-2. First four words: love, light, dreams, stars

3-4. Next four words: darkness, hope, dance, whispers

5-6. Poem using the eight words:

Love whispers, light and darkness,

Dreams dance amid stars and hope.

Stars in darkness, hope in light,

Love whispers dreams, dance of hope.

In this example, the participant chose a mix of eight words that convey emotions, actions, and imagery. They created a poem using these words, repeating some of them to create a cohesive and meaningful piece of writing.

In conclusion, Exercise 10 "Instant Poem" is an engaging and challenging creative writing exercise that pushes participants to think creatively and practice concise expression. By limiting the number of words available, writers are encouraged to focus on the impact and power of individual words, honing their ability to craft evocative and meaningful poetry.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

Well done, you’ve  saved  all  the  words  in  the  world.  I  am  no  longer  a wizard, but you are a poet.

assistant: The outcome of Exercise 10, "Instant Poem," is the realization that despite having only a limited set of words, participants are able to create a meaningful and evocative poem. By completing this exercise, participants can discover their own poetic abilities and appreciate the power of individual words in conveying emotions, imagery, and ideas.

In the context of the exercise, the participant "saves" all the words in the world by crafting a poem using only the eight words they selected. The imaginary wizard role is relinquished, and the participant is recognized as a poet for their accomplishment.

Example:

Let's revisit the poem created in the previous example:

First four words: love, light, dreams, stars

Next four words: darkness, hope, dance, whispers

Poem using the eight words:

Love whispers, light and darkness,

Dreams dance amid stars and hope.

Stars in darkness, hope in light,

Love whispers dreams, dance of hope.

In this example, the participant successfully used the limited set of eight words to create a poem that conveys a sense of emotion and imagery. The poem implies a connection between love, light, darkness, dreams, and hope, suggesting that these elements are intertwined in the human experience.

By accomplishing this task, the participant realizes their poetic potential and appreciates the power of individual words to create a rich and evocative composition.

Exercise 11 Responding to the word

Participants: All groups, individual (4–6 minutes)

Instant-writing can be liberating for any writer, and shows early-stage writers that to produce interesting phrases and original uses of words, they do not have to sit and stare at the sheet of paper waiting for inspira- tion. Indeed, ‘waiting for inspiration’ is the last thing we should be doing; the sitting and pondering comes very far down the line, when we are re- drafting and re-structuring work. The first task is to get it down, in what- ever shape or form, in order to give our critical mind something to work on. This exercise takes us further along this path.

1	Draw a column down the left-hand side of a sheet of paper.

2	At the end of the exercise you will have a list of single words, which I will have given you.

3	You will write the first word in the column.

4	You will immediately write a short phrase or sentence (never just one word) – a thought, a question, a memory, a piece of nonsense – which the word sparks off for you.

5	Do not include the word itself in the phrase or sentence. (See Example 11.1.)

6	You have 10 seconds to write each response.

7	After 10 seconds you will move on to the second word. Stop writing the first phrase, write down the second word in the column, and start writing the second phrase.

8	Keep writing, don’t plan, and if your mind goes blank just write ‘I am writing I am writing’ until something else arrives.

9	Here is the list: Green, Ice, Television, Red, Sand, Love, Religion, Banana, Telephone, Death, Dolphin, London, Shoe, Blue, Mother, Sea, Plane, Summer, Hamburger, Pink, War. (Note to group leader: I usu- ally have a list of 20–25 words, with a good mix of colours, feelings, objects, abstracts and place-names. I never include pronouns. I always try to create a list of words which all members of the particu- lar group will be familiar with.)

10	Read out some of the phrases. (See Examples 11.2.)

assistant: Exercise 11, titled "Responding to the Word," is a creative writing exercise that focuses on using single-word prompts to generate instant reactions in the form of phrases or sentences. This exercise can be done individually or in groups and typically takes 4-6 minutes to complete. The purpose of this exercise is to encourage writers to practice generating ideas quickly without waiting for inspiration, emphasizing the importance of writing spontaneously to give their critical mind material to work with.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Draw a column down the left-hand side of a sheet of paper.

2. Prepare to write a list of single words provided by the exercise.

3. Write the first word in the column.

4. Immediately write a short phrase or sentence inspired by the word. This can be a thought, question, memory, or piece of nonsense.

5. Do not include the word itself in the phrase or sentence.

6. Allow only 10 seconds to write each response.

7. After 10 seconds, move on to the second word. Stop writing the first phrase, write down the second word in the column, and start writing the second phrase.

8. Keep writing without planning, and if your mind goes blank, write "I am writing, I am writing" until something else comes to mind.

9. Use the provided list of words for this exercise: Green, Ice, Television, Red, Sand, Love, Religion, Banana, Telephone, Death, Dolphin, London, Shoe, Blue, Mother, Sea, Plane, Summer, Hamburger, Pink, War. (Group leaders can create their own list with a mix of colors, feelings, objects, abstracts, and place-names, avoiding pronouns and using words familiar to all group members.)

10. Share some of the phrases generated during the exercise.

Example:

1. Word list in the column:

Green

Ice

Television

2. Responses:

Green - Rolling hills stretched to the horizon

Ice - A shiver runs down my spine

Television - Flickering images danced before my eyes

In this example, the participant quickly generated phrases based on the word prompts. The responses reflect thoughts, memories, or imagery sparked by the words.

In conclusion, Exercise 11 "Responding to the Word" helps writers practice spontaneous idea generation and emphasizes the importance of writing without waiting for inspiration. This exercise encourages creative thinking, enhances writing skills, and assists writers in overcoming writer's block by embracing a more instinctual approach to writing.

user: these examples are from the book, compare the with your answer and tell the difference. if anything to be improved.

Example 11.1

If the word is ‘green’, I might write ‘that tatty old school blazer’ (because my school blazer was green and my mother sewed leather arm-patches on it).

Examples 11.2

Some phrases written by one group I worked with:

●	Green: The Emerald City, I am writing, the city.

●	Love: Pain and swelling, envy and blossoming.

●	Banana: Ridicule and madness.

●	Telephone: Revelations and gossip.

●	Death: Darkness, sorrow, fear, I am writing I release.

●	War : Dark, ragged edges, holes in fabric, tears.

assistant: Upon comparing the examples provided in the book with the answer given earlier, there are some differences:

1. In Example 11.1, the response to the word "green" is more specific and personal, mentioning the writer's school blazer and the leather arm-patches sewn by their mother. In the previous answer, the response to "green" is more generic, describing a landscape with rolling hills.

2. Examples 11.2 show a variety of responses that are more abstract, metaphorical, or emotion-driven compared to the responses in the previous answer, which leaned more towards literal or visual descriptions.

Based on these differences, to improve the initial answer, it's important to encourage more personal, emotional, and abstract responses that explore a wider range of perspectives. For example:

1. Word list in the column:

Green

Ice

Television

2. Improved responses:

Green - That tatty old school blazer with leather arm-patches

Ice - A frozen lake, slippery and treacherous

Television - Hours spent with friends, laughing and sharing moments

These improved responses incorporate a more personal touch, while also exploring emotions and abstract concepts. By considering various perspectives and embracing different approaches to the word prompts, writers can further enhance their creative thinking and writing skills.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

This exercise opens the door to a conversation about a very basic aspect of writing: that we all of us have our own individual ways of expressing ourselves through words. The description of ‘war’ as ‘holes in fabric’ is

a brand new image of that event, unique to the person who wrote it. The exercise encourages the writers to trust their own inner voice, and to recognise that creating their own, original work – even if it is one phrase out of the 20–25 or so – is far more interesting than mimicking and repro- ducing what they have heard or read before. Once again, the ‘instant’ nature of the exercise means that they have had the experience of doing it, as opposed to worrying about it.

assistant: The outcome of Exercise 11, "Responding to the Word," emphasizes the importance of recognizing and embracing each individual's unique way of expressing themselves through writing. By quickly generating phrases or sentences in response to single-word prompts, participants discover their own inner voice and learn to trust their instincts in creating original work.

This exercise helps writers realize that generating their own unique expressions, even if only for a single phrase, is more interesting and rewarding than merely reproducing or mimicking what they've read or heard before. The "instant" nature of the exercise allows participants to focus on the experience of writing without worrying about the end result.

Example:

Let's take the word "war" and the unique description from the book: "holes in fabric."

This phrase presents an original perspective on the concept of war, focusing on the damage, disruptions, or gaps it creates in the fabric of society, relationships, or life itself. The writer who came up with this phrase trusted their inner voice and generated a fresh, thought-provoking image that goes beyond conventional descriptions of war.

By engaging in this exercise, participants learn to trust their own creative instincts and develop confidence in their ability to craft original and compelling writing. The outcome of Exercise 11 is a greater appreciation for each individual's unique perspective and the power of originality in the writing process.

Exercise 12 Collective poems

Participants: All groups (10–20 minutes)

1	Take the first word from Exercise 11. Go round the circle and hear from the writers all their individual responses to it.

2	There is often much hilarity the first time around, so go back over the word again, this time asking the writers to speak a little more boldly and listening carefully to the different responses.

3	Discuss which images stand out vividly? What is the overall feel and mood? What lines work well next to each other?

4	Read around the circle again. Repeat the process for each word.  What will emerge is a series of collectively created poems –  the Green Poem, the Love Poem, etc. – each built on a range of individ- ual perceptions.

assistant: Exercise 12, "Collective Poems," is a group exercise that encourages collaboration and sharing of individual responses to create a series of collective poems. This activity brings participants together, helping them appreciate diverse perspectives and the unique insights that each person brings to the table. The exercise typically takes 10-20 minutes to complete.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Start with the first word from Exercise 11. Go around the circle, asking each participant to share their individual responses to the word.

2. As the first round might generate laughter or shyness, repeat the process, encouraging participants to speak more boldly and listen carefully to the different responses.

3. Discuss the vivid images, overall mood, and which lines work well together. This conversation helps participants identify the standout elements in each response.

4. Read the responses around the circle again and repeat the process for each word from Exercise 11. As a result, a series of collectively created poems will emerge, each representing a range of individual perceptions.

Example:

Using the words "Green" and "Love" from Exercise 11, the group shares their individual responses:

Green:

- Rolling hills stretching to the horizon

- The color of my favorite sweater

- Fresh leaves sprouting in spring

Love:

- The warmth of a hug on a cold day

- A tender kiss under the moonlight

- The bond that holds a family together

After discussing the vivid images, mood, and the flow of the lines, the group can create two collective poems:

The Green Poem:

Rolling hills stretching to the horizon,

Fresh leaves sprouting in spring,

The color of my favorite sweater.

The Love Poem:

The warmth of a hug on a cold day,

A tender kiss under the moonlight,

The bond that holds a family together.

In conclusion, Exercise 12, "Collective Poems," promotes collaboration, appreciation for diverse perspectives, and the creation of shared works that celebrate the unique contributions of each participant.

Exercise 13 Poem into performance

Participants: All groups (10–20 minutes)

1	Read one of the poems from Exercise 12 again. Work on it in a bit more detail: it is now more than a random collection of written lines; it is a whole piece. What sort of mood and rhythm comes out? How do the lines sit with each other?

2	Everyone now writes down each line of the poem.

3	When the words ‘I am writing I am writing’ occur, keep these in as they are part of the poem.

4	Everyone now has the same copy of the collectively written poem. (See Example 13.1.)

5	Do the same thing with a few of the other words.

6	Divide up into small groups of 3–5. Each group takes one of the poems.

assistant: Exercise 13, "Poem into Performance," takes the collective poems created in Exercise 12 and transforms them into performance pieces. This exercise encourages participants to think about the mood, rhythm, and flow of the poem, helping them to develop a deeper understanding of the piece. The activity typically takes 10-20 minutes to complete.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Choose one of the poems from Exercise 12 and read it again. Focus on the mood, rhythm, and how the lines relate to each other. This helps participants see the poem as a whole piece rather than just a random collection of lines.

2. Each participant writes down every line of the chosen poem.

3. If the phrase "I am writing, I am writing" appears in the poem, keep it as part of the piece.

4. Now everyone has a copy of the collectively written poem. (See Example 13.1, which we'll create using the Green Poem example from Exercise 12).

5. Repeat the process with a few of the other words and poems from Exercise 12.

6. Divide participants into small groups of 3-5 people. Assign one poem to each group.

Example 13.1:

Using the Green Poem example from Exercise 12:

The Green Poem:

Rolling hills stretching to the horizon,

Fresh leaves sprouting in spring,

The color of my favorite sweater.

Now that each group has a collectively written poem, they can work together to explore the poem's mood, rhythm, and flow. Participants can experiment with different ways to perform the poem, considering factors such as tone, volume, pacing, and body language.

For example, Group 1 might perform the Green Poem with a serene tone and a slow pace, emphasizing the calm and peaceful imagery of the poem. This performance can help participants connect with the poem on a deeper level and appreciate the unique aspects of the collective creation.

In conclusion, Exercise 13, "Poem into Performance," allows participants to develop a greater understanding of their collective poems by exploring different performance aspects. This exercise encourages collaboration, communication, and creative expression as participants bring their poems to life.

2. Actors should project their voices clearly and confidently, ensuring that their words can be heard by the audience.

3. Each actor should take turns reciting a line from the poem, transitioning smoothly between one another.

4. Actors may choose to use gestures or body language to emphasize key words or phrases in their lines.

5. Actors should stay engaged and focused on their fellow performers throughout the performance, reacting naturally to their lines and movements.

In conclusion, the stage layout and positioning for the performance of the collective poem involves dividing the stage into sections and placing each actor in one of these sections. With proper stage prompts, actors can effectively communicate the poem's message and engage with their audience.

user: now an audience comes in accidentally, she doesn’t know what’s going on. would you please explain to her this poem performance and tell her the meaning of it.

assistant: Certainly! If an audience member were to walk in unexpectedly during the poem performance, here's an explanation that can be given to help her understand what's happening:

"Hello! You've just walked into a unique poetry performance event. We're exploring the power of collective creativity through a series of poems written and performed by the participants. Each poem has been crafted by the group, with each person contributing individual lines in response to a given word. The goal of this exercise is to showcase how our unique perceptions and interpretations can come together to create a unified and original piece of art.

Today's performance features several of these collective poems, and the actors on stage are taking turns reciting lines from the poem. They are expressing the mood, rhythm, and flow of the poem through their voices, body language, and facial expressions, bringing the words to life.

The meaning behind each poem may vary, as they are based on the individual responses and interpretations of the participants. The beauty of this performance is that it highlights how our diverse thoughts and experiences can contribute to a shared artistic expression. As you watch, you may find your own personal meaning in the poems and appreciate the collaborative nature of the creative process."

user: now the audience wants join in . she advices 7	Devise a manner of presenting the poem, in whatever style you choose. Add movement, sound, repetition, choral speaking, etc., keeping in mind that the main aim is to bring the poems to life.

Now, let's rehearse the poem with the new idea:

1. The group will use choral speaking for some lines, where all actors recite the line together, creating a harmonious effect.

2. Actors can incorporate movements, gestures, or body language to emphasize certain words or phrases in their lines.

3. The poem's presentation can include sound effects or rhythmic clapping by the actors to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the performance.

4. Actors can use repetition for emphasis, where a line or phrase is repeated by one or multiple actors to add depth and meaning to the poem.

5. Actors should maintain their positions, but they can move within their respective sections to engage with the audience and create an interactive performance.

Rehearsing with these new elements will bring the poem to life and create a dynamic, engaging performance that showcases the collective creativity of the group.

user: now all the actors including the new comers discuss the outcome

Outcome

Having gone through all the stages of Exercises 11 and 12, the group will now have had the experience of (a) individual writing, (b) collective writ- ing, (c) working collaboratively in small groups, and (d) putting a piece of own-written text ‘on its feet’.

assistant: As the actors, including the new participant, gather to discuss the outcome of the exercises, they can reflect on their experiences in various aspects of the creative process:

1. Individual Writing: The actors can share their thoughts on how the initial writing exercise allowed them to tap into their unique perspectives and ideas. They can discuss the challenges and triumphs they encountered when trying to come up with creative responses to the given words.

2. Collective Writing: The group can explore the collaborative nature of the exercise and how it brought their individual ideas together to create a series of collective poems. They can discuss the importance of respecting and valuing each other's contributions and how the process fostered a sense of unity and shared creativity.

3. Working Collaboratively in Small Groups: The actors can reflect on their experiences working in smaller groups to develop the performance aspect of the poems. They can discuss the challenges of collaborating and finding a balance between individual ideas and the collective vision. This part of the process may have taught the participants valuable lessons in communication, compromise, and teamwork.

4. Putting a Piece of Own-Written Text 'On Its Feet': Finally, the group can share their thoughts on the process of transforming their written work into a performance. They can discuss how the addition of movement, sound, repetition, and choral speaking brought their poems to life and enhanced the overall impact of the performance. The actors can also talk about their feelings of accomplishment and pride in presenting their own work to an audience.

Overall, the outcome of these exercises demonstrates the importance of individual creativity and the power of collective collaboration. The actors have grown and learned together, ultimately creating a unique and engaging performance that showcases their shared artistic vision.

Exercise 14 Instant writing, instant poems

Participants: Individual (4–6 minutes)

The work described in Exercises 12 and 13 is equally useful as a warm-up for any writer. Just flip through a dictionary, a magazine, or a novel, land- ing on words at random and write your responses. As ever, don’t plan, don’t pause, just write. By the end you will have your list of 20–25 phrases. Select the five most satisfying to you. Play with the order of them, creat- ing a poem. Try doing this every day for a week: five days, five poems. What has that said about your week? What has it said about what you think? What has it said about how you write?

assistant: Exercise 14, "Instant Writing, Instant Poems," encourages individual participants to engage in a creative writing warm-up activity that promotes spontaneity and self-expression. By quickly generating phrases and sentences in response to random words, participants can discover new ideas and connections, and learn more about their own writing style and thought process. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise with an example:

1. Choose random words: Pick 20-25 random words from a dictionary, magazine, or novel. You can do this by flipping through the pages and stopping at random places.

Example words: melody, raindrop, courage, lantern, whisper

2. Write your responses: For each word, write a short phrase or sentence that the word sparks in your mind. Remember not to plan or pause; just write whatever comes to your mind first.

Example responses:

- Melody: A tune that lingers in the heart

- Raindrop: The sound of nature's tears

- Courage: Standing tall in the face of adversity

- Lantern: A guiding light in the darkness

- Whisper: Secrets shared in hushed tones

3. Select the most satisfying phrases: Out of the 20-25 phrases you've written, choose the five that resonate with you the most or feel the most interesting.

4. Create a poem: Arrange the selected phrases in an order that creates a coherent and meaningful poem. You may need to experiment with different arrangements to find the best fit.

Example poem:

A tune that lingers in the heart

The sound of nature's tears

Standing tall in the face of adversity

A guiding light in the darkness

Secrets shared in hushed tones

5. Repeat daily: Try performing this exercise every day for a week, creating five different poems.

6. Reflect on the experience: After completing the exercise for a week, consider what it has revealed about your week, your thoughts, and your writing style. You may notice patterns, recurring themes, or new insights about your creative process.

By engaging in this exercise, participants can develop their creative writing skills, foster a habit of daily writing, and gain a better understanding of their own thoughts and creative instincts.

BUILDING A CHARACTER

Watching a play is a bit like observing a controlled experiment in human behaviour. The writer places characters together in a situation, just as the physicist mixes up elements and chemicals, to see what will happen. In both cases, explosions cannot be ruled out. It is no coincidence that a love- smitten person can speak of ‘the chemistry that happened when we met’. Play-reviews speak of the ‘on-stage chemistry’ between the actors.

Some of the experiments in putting characters together in a story, to see what happens, are simple and predictable. In a sentimental romance, we know that the sweethearts will end up together. In a melodrama, we know that the hero will defeat the villain. Different genres of story delve into their characters at different levels: Little Red Riding Hood is much less complex than Hamlet; a character from an Agatha Christie story is likely to be more one-dimensional than one from Maya Angelou. All of them have one thing in common: they were built. Sometimes the foundations are shallow and we get the stereotype; with the best, the observation is deep and wholly original; but they all are based upon some form of research into the human heart and psyche.

How do we start building ‘a character’? A key is the recognition that  there are many sides to an individual. Hamlet continues to fascinate us, not because we know how the story ends (he and everyone else dies) but because, each time we hear it, we discover a new aspect to his character. Even Little Red Riding Hood (as we will see later on) may be more than     ‘the silly little girl who didn’t listen to her mother’s advice’.

I will start this series of exercises with three I developed specifically for use with the primary age group. However, as a reminder of the contradic- tions of human behaviour, and the fluidity of human nature, they are as revealing as many of the more complex exercises.

assistant: Building a character in a story involves creating a multi-faceted individual with depth and complexity. The process of character development starts with understanding that humans have many sides, and capturing those nuances can make a character feel more real and relatable. Characters can be built based on research, observation, and imagination. Below is an example of a simple exercise that can be used to build a character, even for primary age groups:

Exercise: Building a Character Through Contradictions

1. Choose a simple character: Start with a well-known character, such as Little Red Riding Hood.

2. List their traits: Write down the basic traits of the character. For Little Red Riding Hood, this could include being innocent, naive, and curious.

3. Explore contradictions: Consider how the character might behave or think in ways that contradict their basic traits. For example, Little Red Riding Hood might show bravery when facing the wolf or display a cunning side when trying to outsmart him.

4. Add complexity: Develop the character further by adding more contradictory traits, experiences, or thoughts. This could include Little Red Riding Hood learning from her mistakes and becoming more cautious or resourceful in future encounters.

Example Character Profile:

- Name: Little Red Riding Hood

- Basic traits: Innocent, naive, curious

- Contradictory traits: Brave, cunning, resourceful

- Experiences: Encountering the wolf, being saved by the woodsman, learning to be more cautious

By exploring the contradictions within a character, we can create a more complex and engaging individual that can captivate the reader's attention. Understanding the fluidity of human nature and the many sides to an individual helps in crafting characters that feel real and relatable, regardless of their role or genre in the story.

Exercise 15 Today my hand

Participants: Primary (1–3 minutes)

1	Draw the outline of your hand on a sheet of paper.

2	Think of all the things your hand has done today: ordinary things, things you feel good about, things you don’t feel so good about, etc.

3	Around the hand write five sentences, each beginning with the words ‘today my hand . . . ’

4	Discuss all the different things a person’s hand does in a day; how we don’t even think about it, but how much it reveals about who we are and what we are like.

assistant: In Exercise 15, "Today my hand," participants are asked to reflect on the various tasks their hand has performed throughout the day. This exercise encourages children to think about their daily actions and how they may reveal something about their character or personality. Here is a detailed explanation with an example:

1. Draw the outline of your hand: Have the participants trace their hand on a sheet of paper. This will serve as a visual reference for the activity.

2. Reflect on daily activities: Ask participants to think about all the things their hand has done today. This includes ordinary tasks, accomplishments they are proud of, and actions they may regret or feel uncomfortable about.

3. Write five sentences: Participants should write five sentences around the hand outline, each beginning with the phrase "Today my hand..." These sentences should describe the actions or activities their hand was involved in throughout the day.

4. Discuss and share: Invite the participants to discuss the various things their hands do in a day, focusing on how these actions reveal aspects of their personality and character. Encourage sharing and open discussion among participants to foster a sense of connection and understanding.

Example:

1. Hand outline drawn on paper.

2. Participant reflects on their day and the activities their hand took part in.

3. Five sentences written around the hand outline:

- "Today my hand helped my mom in the kitchen."

- "Today my hand played with my little sister."

- "Today my hand wrote a letter to my best friend."

- "Today my hand accidentally spilled juice on the floor."

- "Today my hand fed our dog."

4. Participants discuss their sentences and share their experiences, gaining insight into each other's lives and characters.

By engaging in this exercise, children become more aware of their daily actions and consider how these activities contribute to their overall character. The exercise also promotes self-reflection and encourages empathy and understanding among participants as they share their experiences.

```

In this stage design, participants are positioned facing the audience, with enough space between them to comfortably present their hand outlines and share their experiences. You can adapt the number of participants and their positions based on the size of the stage and the number of people involved in the performance.

To start the performance, each participant can step forward, display their hand outline to the audience, and read their five sentences. After everyone has shared, participants can engage in a group discussion on stage, exploring the similarities and differences in their daily actions, and reflecting on what those actions reveal about their characters.

As an alternative, you could also arrange chairs in a semi-circle on stage for the participants to sit and share their experiences in a more intimate setting, allowing for a more conversational performance. The stage design might look like this:

```

+-----------------------------------------------+

|                                               |

|   P1       P2        P3        P4        P5  |

|    \__                                      |

|        \__   Chair Semi-Circle            |

|                                               |

+-----------------------------------------------+

```

In this design, "P1, P2, P3, P4, P5" represent the positions of participants, and the "\" lines indicate chairs arranged in a semi-circle. Participants can sit on the chairs, show their hand outlines, and discuss their experiences with the audience.

user: now the actors stand up and move. plese mark their route using ascii and explain why they move that way.

assistant: In this new stage design, the actors will stand up and move to create a more dynamic performance that encourages interaction among them. Here's an ASCII representation of their movement routes:

```

+-----------------------------------------------+

|                                               |

|   P1       P2        P3        P4        P5  |

|    \__        *      *         *         *  |

|        \__   Chair Semi-Circle   *         |

|                   *        *         *       |

+-----------------------------------------------+

```

In this design, the asterisks (*) represent the movement routes of the actors. The actors will stand up from their chairs and move towards the center of the stage, creating a more connected and engaging performance.

Here's the reason behind the movement:

1. By moving towards the center, actors can create a sense of unity and collaboration, emphasizing the shared experiences and reflections that the "Today my hand" exercise brings.

2. The movement allows actors to physically engage with their performance, adding a dynamic element that makes it more visually appealing for the audience.

3. As the actors move, they can interact with one another more closely, fostering a sense of connection and encouraging deeper discussion about their daily actions and the insights they reveal about their characters.

After moving towards the center, the actors can engage in a group discussion about their hand outlines and experiences, sharing thoughts and insights with both each other and the audience.

user: Now you are Pina the great dancer, please teach them a dance about today my hand. give instructions in details please.

assistant: As Pina, the great dancer, I am delighted to share a dance inspired by the "Today my hand" exercise. This dance will incorporate hand movements to express the various actions and emotions connected to the theme. Here are the detailed instructions for the dance:

1. Warming up: Encourage the actors to stretch their hands, wrists, arms, and shoulders to prepare for the dance.

2. Positioning: Have the actors stand in a circle, facing inwards, maintaining a comfortable distance from one another.

3. Introduction (8 counts): Each actor will take turns moving their hands to the center of the circle, representing one action their hand did today. They will move their hands in sync with the rhythm, taking one count for each movement.

4. Verse 1 (16 counts): Actors will move their hands gracefully in front of their body, reflecting the "ordinary things" their hands did today. Encourage them to create fluid movements with their wrists and fingers, flowing from one action to another.

5. Chorus (16 counts): Actors will perform bold, expressive hand gestures to represent the things they feel good about. They should move their hands with strength and confidence, highlighting the positive aspects of their day.

6. Verse 2 (16 counts): Actors will shift to more subtle, introspective hand movements, illustrating the things they don't feel so good about. Their movements should be more reserved and reflective, evoking the complexity of human emotions.

7. Chorus (16 counts): Repeat the same bold, expressive hand gestures from the first chorus, reinforcing the positive aspects of their day.

8. Bridge (16 counts): Actors will reach out towards the center of the circle with both hands, then pull their hands back towards their hearts. This movement symbolizes the connection between their daily actions and their inner selves.

9. Chorus (16 counts): Perform the bold, expressive hand gestures once more, celebrating the positive aspects of the day.

10. Outro (8 counts): Actors will gradually slow down their movements, bringing their hands to rest on their hearts. This symbolizes the acknowledgment and acceptance of the various aspects of their day.

11. Ending: Encourage the actors to take a moment of stillness and reflection before relaxing and stepping out of the circle.

Remember, the dance should be adapted to the actors' unique experiences and abilities. Encourage them to express themselves freely and creatively, allowing their hand movements to tell the story of their day.

user: Now Pina and actors sit down and discuss the outcome

Outcome

This simple exercise shows how, in one day, the same person can do something with love (‘ ... stroked my cat’) and something not quite so lov- ing (‘ . . . pulled my sister’s hair’). It opens a conversation about how a character in a story may be many things, depending on who they are with, what they are doing, how they are feeling, etc.

assistant: After the dance, Pina and the actors sit down together to discuss the outcome of the "Today my hand" dance. Here is the potential discussion and outcome:

Pina: So, how did you all feel about the dance? What emotions or thoughts did it bring up for you?

Actor 1: I felt like I was really connecting with my actions from the day. It made me more aware of how my hands played a role in my daily experiences.

Actor 2: It was interesting to see how the dance allowed us to express both the positive and negative aspects of our day through hand movements.

Pina: That's great! This dance exercise was meant to show how, in just one day, a person can experience a range of emotions and actions. It's important to remember that our characters in a story or play can also be multifaceted, depending on their interactions, emotions, and circumstances.

Actor 3: Yes, it made me realize that we shouldn't create one-dimensional characters. Instead, we should aim to portray them as complex individuals with their own unique experiences and emotions.

Actor 4: I also think this exercise helped us to connect with our characters on a deeper level. By exploring the different aspects of their day, we can gain insight into their personalities and motivations.

Pina: Exactly! As performers and writers, it's essential to consider the complexities of human behavior and emotions. This exercise should serve as a reminder to always strive for depth and authenticity when creating and portraying characters.

Outcome: The "Today my hand" dance exercise provided valuable insights into the multidimensionality of human emotions and actions. It encouraged actors and writers to consider the many facets of their characters, resulting in more complex and authentic portrayals. The exercise also served as a means for self-reflection and connection with one's own daily experiences.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Exercise 16 Inside–outside Part one

Participants: Primary (3–6 minutes)

1	Think of someone you know and like. Write a physical description of them, so that if I were to meet them I would recognise them. Try and use all five senses. Are they big or small? What does their voice sound like? What sort of shoes do they wear? How do they walk, etc. (See Example 16.1.)

2	Draw a large outline of a person. This is an imaginary character. Around the outline, write as many physical descriptions as you can. Try and be very detailed. If they are wearing a blue shirt, is it bright blue or dark blue? If they have black hair, is it short, curly black hair or long, limp black hair? What are the different ways of describing the sound of a voice? We now have an idea of what that person is like on the out- side. This tells us a little of who they are and what they might be like.

3	Now write inside the outline of the person. In the space where the head is, write down all the different words and phrases that describe ‘thinking’. (See Examples 16.2.)

4	In the space where the heart is, write down all the words and phrases that describe ‘feelings’. (See Examples 16.3.)

assistant: In this exercise, participants are encouraged to explore the details of both the physical appearance and the inner thoughts and feelings of a character. Let's go through each step with an example.

Step 1:

Think of someone you know and like. For example, let's choose a friend named Emma. Write a physical description of Emma: She is of average height, has shoulder-length wavy brown hair, and wears glasses with a round frame. She has a soft, melodic voice that is gentle and calming. She often wears comfortable sneakers and walks with a confident stride.

Step 2:

Draw a large outline of an imaginary person. Add detailed physical descriptions around the outline, such as:

- Dark blue, knee-length dress

- Long, straight black hair

- Bright green eyes

- Red lipstick

- Wearing a silver wristwatch

- High-heeled black boots

- Confident posture

Step 3:

Write inside the outline of the person, focusing on the head area, to describe 'thinking'. Include words and phrases like:

- Analytical

- Creative

- Curious

- Daydreamer

- Logical

- Reflective

- Strategic

Step 4:

In the space where the heart is, write down words and phrases that describe 'feelings':

- Compassionate

- Empathetic

- Excitable

- Fearful

- Joyful

- Sensitive

- Warm

This exercise helps participants to build a well-rounded character by considering both their physical appearance and their inner thoughts and feelings. By focusing on these aspects, participants can create more complex and relatable characters for their stories or plays.

user: everyone now give these examples. please comment on them

Example 16.1

He has rough hands, a high-pitched voice, shiny shoes, long legs, etc.

Examples 16.2

Plans, brainwork, thoughts, maths, ideas, interests, etc.

Examples 16.3

Love, sadness, hate, feeling good, jolly, etc.

assistant: Example 16.1 focuses on the physical description of a character, providing details that help us visualize this person. However, it could be more specific in its descriptions to paint a clearer picture. For example, instead of saying "shiny shoes," one could say "shiny black leather shoes" or "shiny patent leather dress shoes."

Examples 16.2 and 16.3 list words and phrases related to thinking and feelings, respectively. These examples offer a range of emotions and thoughts that can be attributed to a character, helping to build their personality and inner world.

To further enhance these examples, participants could add more specific and descriptive words or phrases. For instance, in Example 16.2, instead of using the general term "ideas," one could mention "innovative ideas" or "practical solutions." Similarly, in Example 16.3, instead of using the term "jolly," one could use "exuberant joy" or "contagious enthusiasm."

By using more specific and descriptive words or phrases, participants can create a richer and more nuanced character, making it easier for readers or audiences to connect with them on a deeper level.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Part two – inside–outside

Participants: Primary (3–6 minutes)

1	Draw a large outline of a person. This is now a character you are making up.

2	Using the list of ‘inside things’, write down what thoughts the person has, and what makes the person have different feelings.

assistant: In Part two of the Inside-Outside exercise, participants are asked to create an imaginary character by focusing on their inner thoughts and feelings, building on the previous exercise where they provided a physical description.

1. Start by drawing a large outline of a person on a sheet of paper. This will be the imaginary character you are creating.

2. Using the list of 'inside things' from the previous exercise (Examples 16.2 and 16.3), write down the character's thoughts and feelings within the outline. For this part, think about what situations or experiences may evoke different feelings and thoughts in your character.

Example:

Suppose we create a character named Sarah. Inside the outline of Sarah, we'll write her thoughts and feelings.

- In the head area, write her thoughts:

- Dreams of becoming a veterinarian

- Worries about her upcoming exams

- Thinks about her friends and family

- Enjoys solving puzzles

- Often daydreams about traveling the world

- In the heart area, write her feelings:

- Feels happy when spending time with her pet dog

- Feels sad when she sees animals in pain or suffering

- Feels proud of her achievements in school

- Feels anxious about fitting in with her peers

- Feels excited about the prospect of going to college

By including both the character's thoughts and feelings, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of their personality, motivations, and emotions. This approach helps create well-rounded and believable characters that resonate with readers or audiences.

关心医生童年

user: 就下面这篇帖子，给这位医生写一个回复，表示对她童年的关心，以及对她这种回忆写作的鼓励。

MAY-20230414-第一次感受死亡

2023.04.14 00:00

第一次觉得自己快要死了是在幼儿园中班还是大班的时候。那是午休时间，我将口香糖不小心咽下去了，然后躺在小床上留着眼泪，静静等待死亡的来临。

口香糖那时候叫泡泡糖，是小伙伴的爸爸从上海出差时买回来送我的。我很是欣喜并珍惜，那是物资匮乏的时代。

泡泡糖可以吹起很大很大的泡泡，大到泡泡破了的时候可以糊住整个嘴巴，有时候甚至会粘到鼻子上。如果粘上了，我们会用脏脏的小手将其撕下来继续放进嘴巴里，继续嚼，继续吹，互相比赛，看谁吹的泡泡大。不想嚼的时候，便放进衣服角里，想吹泡泡时，再取出来，现在想起来，有时候泡泡糖都成黑色了，还在吹泡泡。

那天中午午休时，我本将泡泡糖收进来衣服角里，但是一时半会睡不着，便又悄悄取出来放进嘴巴里嚼着吹泡泡，因为是躺着一不小心，泡泡糖顺着喉咙咽进去了，我告诉隔壁伙伴，说我把泡泡糖咽进去。小朋友异常认真的说“泡泡糖咽进去，会将肠子粘住，然后会死的”。我因为午休时悄悄吃的泡泡糖，不敢说，想到自己快要死了，静静躺着，还留着眼泪。想到爸爸下午来接我发现我已经死了怎么办？想着想着，睡着了，午休醒来发现自己竟然没有死。但从此以后再也不敢躺着嚼泡泡糖，好像也不在将泡泡糖放进衣服角了。

那是我记忆中第一次感受死亡。

assistant: 亲爱的MAY医生，

非常感谢您分享了这段童年的回忆。在我们的成长过程中，这些看似微不足道的经历往往对我们产生深远的影响。读到您当时在小床上流着眼泪等待死亡，我不禁感叹童年时代的无知与纯真，同时也惋惜您当时的恐惧与无助。

尽管那个时代物资匮乏，但泡泡糖和朋友之间的竞争给您带来了无尽的欢乐。这些珍贵的回忆无疑让我们更加怀念那段时光，也提醒我们珍惜当下，以及勇敢面对生活中的困境。

您用文字记录下这段经历，不仅让读者感受到了您的真诚与热情，还鼓励了大家将自己的回忆写出来，分享给更多的人。这种回忆写作不仅有助于我们了解自己，还能帮助他人找到共鸣，从而产生深刻的情感联系。

再次感谢您分享这段回忆，希望您继续在这个平台上分享更多有趣、感人的故事。祝您生活愉快，工作顺利！

诚挚的祝福，

[您的名字]

user: 用黄纪苏翻译的《爱因斯坦的梦》的风格（见下文），来重新组织这段话，去掉客套，留下睿智的思考和简练的文字。

世界将在一九零七年九月二十六日结束。这个人人都清楚。

伯尔尼的情形和所有的城镇一样。末日的前一年，学校都关了门。来日无多，干吗还要为来日学习？孩子们乐得再没了功课，在克拉姆街拱廊里玩逮人，到阿勒街上疯跑，往河里扔石子，把零币都买了薄荷甘草糖。家长们随他们爱干什么就干什么。

末日前一个月，四行八作都关了张。议会大厦里再没什么可议的，电报大楼无声无响，劳奔大街上的表厂、努代克桥那边的面粉厂也都没了动静。就剩那么一点儿时间，还要什么工商业？

阿姆特豪斯街的露天咖啡馆，人们坐在那儿抿着咖啡，轻松随意地谈论生活。空气里充满了解放。例如此刻有位棕眼睛女人正跟她妈说，小时候妈妈给人当裁缝没时间跟她在一起。母女俩计划着到卢塞恩一游。她们要把两条生命往余下的一点儿时间里妥善安排。另一张桌上，有个男子告诉他的朋友，混帐上司时常在办公室的更衣间和他老婆几小时几小时地苟且，而且威胁他们夫妇，要是找麻烦就开了他。现在还有什么好顾虑的？他把老板收拾了，夫妻也言归于好。心事总算了却了，于是伸展腿脚，让眼睛随阿尔卑斯山东游西逛。

面包铺里的师傅手指粗粗的，哼哼着小曲，把面团放进炉里。这些日子大家来买面包全都那么客气。一个个笑容可掬，掏钱麻利，因为钱正不值钱。他们聊弗里堡的野餐，聊孩子讲给他们的可爱故事，聊下午遛的长长的弯儿。他们好像不在乎世界完不完结，反正大家同命运。只剩一个月的世界是个平等的世界。

末日的前一天，街上笑语欢声。从不说话的邻居互致朋友的问候，宽衣解带到喷泉里洗澡。还有人往阿勒河里扎猛子，游到筋疲力尽，便躺在河边厚厚的草上吟诗诵赋。素昧平生的高等法院律师和邮局小职员笑谈着艺术和色彩，手挽手走在植物园的姹紫嫣红里。从前的职位高低还有什么关系？在只剩一天的世界里，他俩站着一般高，坐着一般齐。

从阿勒拜尔街拐下来的一条小街的暗处，一男一女倚着墙喝啤酒吃熏肉。然后她把他带回自己的公寓。她是有夫之妇，但多年来一直恋着这个男人。她要在世界的末日一了自己的心愿。

个别家伙在街上跑来跑去着做好人好事，以弥补从前的过失。只有他们笑得不大自然。

结束前一分钟所有人都集合在艺术馆外的空地上。男人女人孩子围成大圈拉起手。没有人说话，绝对的寂静，以至能听见左右人的心跳。这是世界的最后一分钟。在这绝对的寂静中，花园里一束紫龙胆花底一闪，熠熠生辉，旋即隐没在众芳之中。博物馆后一棵落叶松的针叶在微风中瑟瑟。后面的树林透出阿勒河面上的万点碎日。东面圣文森大教堂单薄的红色塔楼耸入半空，它的石头构造像叶脉一样纤细。高高在上的阿尔卑斯山满头飞雪，紫白交映，广大肃穆。一片云在飘。一只燕在飞。没有人说话。

最后几秒钟，仿佛是大家手拉着手跳离了托帕兹峰。结尾像大地一样来到。寒气驰过，身体没了重量。静静的地平线张大口。茫茫白毯越逼越近，终于将这团粉红、这团生命席卷了去。

assistant: 时间将在某一刻结束，这是人们都知道的事实。

城市的情形与其他地方一样。时间有限，学校关闭，孩子们尽情玩耍，无需为未来担忧。家长们也放任他们去享受。

世界只剩一个月，所有工作和商业都停止了。人们在露天咖啡馆轻松地谈论着生活，空气中弥漫着解放的气息。人们计划着如何度过剩下的时间，分享过去的故事，放下过去的委屈，欣然面对未来。

这个世界只剩一个月，却变得更加平等。街上欢声笑语，素不相识的人互相寒暄。职位高低不再重要，在这有限的时间里，人人都站在同一高度。

末日前，人们为了弥补过去的过失，到处做好事。然而，他们的笑容显得有些勉强。

结束前一刻，人们聚集在广场上，围成一个大圈，拉起手来。在这绝对的寂静中，大自然依然生机勃勃。没有人说话。

最后几秒钟，仿佛人们与世界共同走向终结。寒气驰过，身体失去重量。静静的地平线张开口，茫茫的白毯逼近，终将带走这片生命的痕迹。

MAY-20230414-第一次感受死亡

2023.04.14 00:00

第一次觉得自己快要死了是在幼儿园中班还是大班的时候。那是午休时间，我将口香糖不小心咽下去了，然后躺在小床上留着眼泪，静静等待死亡的来临。

口香糖那时候叫泡泡糖，是小伙伴的爸爸从上海出差时买回来送我的。我很是欣喜并珍惜，那是物资匮乏的时代。

泡泡糖可以吹起很大很大的泡泡，大到泡泡破了的时候可以糊住整个嘴巴，有时候甚至会粘到鼻子上。如果粘上了，我们会用脏脏的小手将其撕下来继续放进嘴巴里，继续嚼，继续吹，互相比赛，看谁吹的泡泡大。不想嚼的时候，便放进衣服角里，想吹泡泡时，再取出来，现在想起来，有时候泡泡糖都成黑色了，还在吹泡泡。

那天中午午休时，我本将泡泡糖收进来衣服角里，但是一时半会睡不着，便又悄悄取出来放进嘴巴里嚼着吹泡泡，因为是躺着一不小心，泡泡糖顺着喉咙咽进去了，我告诉隔壁伙伴，说我把泡泡糖咽进去。小朋友异常认真的说“泡泡糖咽进去，会将肠子粘住，然后会死的”。我因为午休时悄悄吃的泡泡糖，不敢说，想到自己快要死了，静静躺着，还留着眼泪。想到爸爸下午来接我发现我已经死了怎么办？想着想着，睡着了，午休醒来发现自己竟然没有死。但从此以后再也不敢躺着嚼泡泡糖，好像也不在将泡泡糖放进衣服角了。

那是我记忆中第一次感受死亡。

assistant: 死亡的感触如此难以捉摸，may医生的这篇《第一次感受死亡》让我们回到了儿时，体会到那时死亡的无知与恐惧。在这篇短文中，作者以口香糖为线索，勾起我们关于物资匮乏时代的回忆。当时的孩子们，将口香糖视作珍宝，即便脏了也依然继续嚼，用泡泡糖来度过快乐的童年时光。

然而，在无意中将口香糖吞下的那一刻，死亡的阴影悄悄降临。孩子们对死亡的恐惧源于对未知的无助，而悄悄落下的眼泪，让我们感受到了当时小小的心灵所承受的沉重。从这个经历，may医生开始认识到死亡的存在，并随之而来的是更加谨慎和小心。

这篇短文以简练的文字展现了生命的脆弱和宝贵，让我们在回忆中明白，无论岁月如何变迁，人们对生命的敬畏与珍视始终不变。

user: 用爱因斯坦的梦的文风，来改写may医生的这篇文章。可以参考下面这篇

设想时间是一个圆圈，弯转过来首尾相接。世界重复着自己，无休无止，不差毫厘。

人们大都不知道，活过的日子还会从头再来。商人不知道同一买卖要一做再做。政治家不知道在时间的轮回中，他们还要在同一讲台上叫嚷无数遍。父母将儿女的第一声笑珍藏在心，好像再不会听到。头回做爱的恋人怯生生除却衣裳，对软腿酥胸叹为观止。他们哪里晓得那眉目之意、肌肤之亲都将一而再，再而三，一成不变？

马克街上也是如此。那儿的店老板哪里知道，他们出手的每件手编毛衣、每条绣花手绢、每块巧克力糖、每只精巧的手表的罗盘，都还会回到他们手上？日落黄昏，老板们有的回家享天伦，有的下酒馆，冲着外边拱廊巷呼朋唤友。他们把每寸时光像代销的绿宝石那样抓紧把玩。他们哪里知道，天底下没有过客，一切都将重来。水晶吊灯檐上爬行的蚂蚁当然不会知道，它正返回它起步的地方。

盖勃胡同的医院里，一个妇人在向丈夫道别。他躺在床上，茫然地望着她。过去两个月里，他的喉癌扩散到了肝胰和大脑。两个年幼的孩子坐在屋角的椅子上，不敢看那老人般塌陷的面颊、皱缩的皮肤。妻子来到床前，轻轻吻过丈夫的额头，低声说了再见，带着孩子匆匆离去。她肯定这是最后一吻。她哪里知道一切将周而复始，她还要出生，还要读大学预科，还要在苏黎世的画廊举办画展，还要在弗里堡的小图书馆遇见他，还要同他在暖洋洋的七月去图恩湖荡舟，还要生孩子，丈夫还要在药房干上八年，然后一夕归来时喉咙长了瘤子，还要呕吐还是衰竭，还要在这个钟点，这家医院、这张病床淹然化去。她怎么会知道呢？

在时间为圆的世界里，每次握手、每次亲吻、每回生产、每个字眼都将毫不走样的重复。朋友闹翻、龃龉生于琴瑟、亲情毁在了金钱、上司嫉妒给小鞋穿、许了的愿不算，这一切都将重演。

正如一切都将重复下去，一切都已发生万遍。每个城市里都有个别人，在睡梦里隐约觉出所有事都曾发生在从前。这些人趑蹶蹭蹬，而且意识到自己前世即已想错做错、多灾多难。倒霉人与床单鏖战于死一样的夜晚。他又怎么能够安生，既已明白前世覆辙来世还要重蹈，每个举动都无法改变？这些两头落难的人说明了时间是个圆。每个城市后半夜的空街阳台，都被他们的唉声叹气填满。

1905年4月16日

在这个世界里，时间仿佛偶因一堆石、一阵风而改道的水流。宇宙的一些故障时不时地使时间的大河岔出小溪倒转。赶上这时候，河汊里的鸟儿、土地和人们便蓦然发现自己回到了过去。

被运回到过去的人很容易辨认。他们深衣蹑行，尽量不出一点儿声，不碰一根草。他们害怕过去弄出的动静会对将来发生不利的影响。

例如此时此刻，就有这么一位蹲在克拉姆街十九号拱廊的阴影里。她呆在那个地方，对于来自将来的旅人不是个合适的去处。行人走去走来，东张西望。她蜷在角落里，倏而又溜过街道，缩进二十二号的一个黑处。她生怕脚下扬起尘土，因为一九零五年四月十六日这天下午有位彼得•克劳森正往斯皮塔尔街的药铺走着。这位克劳森讲究穿着，一尘不染。若是衣上着了土，便会停下来不厌其烦地掸干净，全不管约好的事情。如果时间实在不够了，那他也许就不给嚷了几个礼拜腿疼的老婆买药膏。老婆一赌气也许就取消日内瓦湖之游。如果一九零五年六月二十三日不去日内瓦湖，她自然也就不可能在湖东的堤上遇上遛弯的某位凯瑟林•戴碧奈，也就无从把戴碧奈小姐介绍给儿子理查。那样也就没有一九零八年十二月十七日理查和凯瑟林的结合，也就没有一九一二年七月八日弗利德里的问世，也就没有弗利德里•克劳森一九三八年八月二十二日做汉斯•克劳森的爹爹那回事。没了汉斯•克劳森，一九七九年的欧洲联盟便无从说起了。

这位将来的女人，被时间一家伙地从彼时抛到此时，在克拉姆大街二十二号的暗处藏头匿尾。她知道克劳森的以及别的千百个故事，这些故事将由婴儿的降生、街上的人流、此时的鸟鸣、彼处的椅子或许还有一阵风来展开。她蜷缩在阴影中，人家看她，她不看人家。她蜷缩着，等着光阴之流把她载回到她自己的时间。

当来自未来的旅人必须开口时，他哀哀嘤嘤而不讲话。他忧心忡忡，因为任何微小的变化都可能损害他的将来。他被迫目睹，却不得参与和改变事件。他羡慕那些生活在自己时间里的人：不知将来，不计后果，想干什么就干.他无所作为，像一洼惰性气体，一个幽灵，一张无声无气的纸。他没有人格，他是时间的流放犯。

每个城镇、每个村庄都可以见到这样的倒霉鬼，躲在墙根下、地窖中、桥洞内、野地里。没人向他们打听将发生的事情，将来的婚姻、将来的生育，将来的金融、将来有什么发明、将来如何赚钱。他们只是遭人冷落，被人可怜。

assistant: 在时间无穷无尽的圆圈中，一名医生的故事同样在无数次重复。这名医生名叫梅（May），他的生活被卷入这奇特的世界，一切重复着前一刻，前一天，前一生。

梅医生并不知道他曾经治愈过同样的病人，给予过无数次的安慰。他每天在医院里奔波，为病人提供医治，但他并不知道，这些努力将一再重复，一次又一次，永无尽头。每当他为一个病人找到正确的诊断时，他都会感到无比欣慰。可他从未意识到，在时间的圆圈中，他将永远为这些病人诊断、治愈和安慰。

在这个永恒重复的世界里，梅医生的手术台上发生了无数次相同的手术。在同一座医院，他开刀救治过不计其数的病人，而每一次，他都不知道自己已经做过这个手术无数次。每一次手术，他都会竭尽全力，克服种种困难，最终拯救病人的生命。然而，他从未意识到，他将永远在这个手术台上为病人挽回生命。

在时间的轮回中，梅医生渐渐意识到了自己的悲哀。他明白，他所做的每一件事都将在未来的某个时刻重演。在这个永恒循环的世界里，他不再是一个有尊严的医生，而是一个永恒的演员，反复上演着同一场戏。

然而，梅医生不愿放弃。他不断地提醒自己，尽管他所做的一切都将重复，但这并不意味着他无法改变未来。他坚信，如果他能够真诚地为每一个病人提供关爱和治疗，那么在这个永恒的循环中，他的存在也将有意义。

于是，梅医生继续努力，继续治愈。尽管他知道自己的每一次努力都将在未来重演，但他坚信，只要他为每一个病人付出真诚，那么他的生活也将有价值。

在这个时间无尽的世界中，梅医

user: 继续

assistant: 生在这个时间无尽的世界中，梅医生开始思考时间与命运的奥秘。他不禁想象，如果时间真的是一个圆圈，那么他的每一个决定、每一个行动都将影响着整个世界的走向。他开始审视自己的人生，试图找到那些可以改变命运的关键时刻。

梅医生的探索引领他走向了更深层次的认知。在时间的旅程中，他遇到了来自过去和未来的旅人，与他们交流，分享彼此的故事。他了解到，在这个重复的宇宙里，每个人都在为了改变命运而努力，每个人都在寻找生命的意义。

梅医生逐渐明白，他的使命不仅仅是治病救人，更是在这个永恒循环的世界中找到真正的价值。他决定，无论未来如何重复，他都将竭尽全力，为每一个病人带来关爱与治愈，为这个世界带来一丝温暖。

在时间的轮回中，梅医生开始领悟到生命的真谛。他明白，尽管命运会不断重演，但每个人都可以在时间的长河中找到自己的价值。只要我们诚挚地关爱他人、努力地改善生活，我们就能在这个永恒的宇宙中留下独特的印记。

于是，在每一个重复的时刻，梅医生都全心全意地投入到医治与关爱之中。他相信，只要他坚持不懈，那么在时间的圆圈中，他的生命将永远闪耀着光辉。而那些因他而得以康复的病人，也将在这个奇妙世界中找到属于自己的意义。因此，尽管时间不断循环，但梅医生和他的病人们都在努力地书写着属于自己的故事，创造着属于他们的价值。

user: summarize the plot of breaking bad s05e14

assistant: In Breaking Bad Season 5 Episode 14, titled "Ozymandias," Walter White's world begins to crumble around him. Following the intense shootout between Hank and the white supremacist gang in the previous episode, Hank is tragically killed, leaving Walt devastated. The gang takes most of Walt's money, leaving him with only a single barrel of cash.

Walt then reveals to Todd's uncle that Jesse Pinkman was hiding under a car, leading to his capture. Walt spitefully tells Jesse about his role in Jane's death before Jesse is taken away to be tortured and forced into cooking meth for the gang.

Walt returns home and tries to convince his family to flee with him, but Skyler and Walter Jr. are horrified to learn about Hank's death. A confrontation ensues, with Skyler threatening Walt with a knife, and Walter Jr. calling the police. Walt escapes with baby Holly, but ultimately decides to leave her at a fire station for her safety.

The episode ends with Walt contacting Saul's "disappearer" to start a new life under a new identity. "Ozymandias" is a pivotal episode in the series, as it marks the complete unraveling of Walt's life and the disintegration of his family.

user: how can i write an episode as good as breaking bad s05e14?

assistant: To write a TV episode as compelling and powerful as Breaking Bad's "Ozymandias" (S05E14), consider the following steps and principles:

1. Develop strong characters: Create multi-dimensional, relatable, and engaging characters with unique voices, motivations, and conflicts. The characters should have depth and evolve over time, just as the characters in Breaking Bad do.

2. Craft a gripping story: Build a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use a solid narrative structure, with compelling conflicts and challenges that keep the audience engaged. Ensure that each scene contributes to the story's progression and character development.

3. Maintain high stakes: The stakes should be high for the characters, both on a personal and broader level. In "Ozymandias," the stakes are life and death, as well as the collapse of Walt's entire world. High stakes create tension and increase audience investment in the story.

4. Focus on character-driven drama: The best episodes often center on the emotional struggles and personal relationships of the characters. "Ozymandias" showcases the disintegration of Walt's family, as well as his relationships with Hank and Jesse.

5. Use visual storytelling: Strong visuals, like the barren desert landscape in "Ozymandias," can contribute to the episode's atmosphere and help convey the story's themes. Think about how to use visual elements to enhance your story.

6. Create memorable dialogue: Write dialogue that is unique to each character, revealing their personalities and emotions. Great dialogue can heighten the drama and become quotable moments that resonate with the audience.

7. Build tension and suspense: Keep the audience on the edge of their seats by creating tense and suspenseful situations. Gradually raise the stakes and use twists or unexpected developments to keep viewers engaged.

8. Develop strong themes: Identify the core themes of your episode and explore them throughout the story. In "Ozymandias," themes like power, corruption, and the consequences of one's actions are woven into the narrative.

9. Pay attention to pacing: Maintain a steady pace that keeps the story moving forward, while allowing for quieter, character-driven moments. Balancing action and introspection is crucial for creating a well-rounded episode.

10. Revise and refine: Writing a great episode takes time and effort. Be prepared to revise and refine your script, getting feedback from others, and making changes to improve the story, dialogue, and structure.

Ultimately, writing an episode as powerful and memorable as Breaking Bad's "Ozymandias" requires a combination of strong storytelling, character development, and attention to detail. With practice, dedication, and a focus on these principles, you can work towards creating a compelling TV episode.

user: why can’t i gist

(base) ding@dingjiacuns-MacBook-Pro Rime % Gist https://gist.github.com/lewangdev/f8ebbba24f464e915fb7d36857fcbbe5

zsh: command not found: Gist

assistant: It looks like you are trying to use the `Gist` command to access a GitHub Gist in your terminal, but you are receiving a "command not found" error. This error occurs because `Gist` is not a recognized command in your terminal. To access a Gist or interact with GitHub Gists, you can use the `gist` command-line tool, which is not installed by default.

Here are the steps to install and use the `gist` command-line tool:

1. First, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check if Ruby is installed by running the following command:

```

ruby -v

```

If Ruby is not installed, you can follow the instructions at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/ to install it.

2. Install the `gist` command-line tool using the following command:

```

gem install gist

```

3. To use the `gist` command, you can run it with the URL of the Gist you want to access. For example:

```

gist https://gist.github.com/lewangdev/f8ebbba24f464e915fb7d36857fcbbe5

```

This command will download the Gist content and display it in your terminal.

Note that the command is lowercase (`gist`), not uppercase (`Gist`). Make sure to use the correct case when typing the command.

For more information on how to use the `gist` command-line tool, you can refer to its documentation at https://github.com/defunkt/gist.

assistant: It seems you are encountering a permission issue when trying to install the `gist` gem. This issue occurs because you don't have the necessary permissions to write to the `/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0` directory.

To resolve this issue, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Install the gem using `sudo`**: This method grants temporary administrative privileges to install the gem. Run the following command:

```

sudo gem install gist

```

You may be prompted to enter your system password. After entering the password, the gem should be installed without any permission issues.

2. **Install a Ruby version manager**: Another approach is to use a Ruby version manager like RVM (Ruby Version Manager) or rbenv. These tools allow you to install and manage multiple Ruby versions and gemsets, without affecting the system Ruby installation or requiring administrative privileges.

Here's how to install RVM and use it to install the `gist` gem:

a. Install RVM using the following command:

```

curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

```

b. Load RVM into your current shell session:

```

source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

```

c. Install the latest stable Ruby version:

```

rvm install ruby --latest

```

d. Set the installed Ruby version as the default:

```

rvm use ruby --default

```

e. Install the `gist` gem:

```

gem install gist

```

With RVM, you can install gems without encountering permission issues, as it manages Ruby installations and gems in your user directory.

Choose the method that best suits your needs. Once you've successfully installed the `gist` gem, you should be able to use the `gist` command without any issues.

(base) ding@dingjiacuns-MacBook-Pro Rime %

assistant: It seems like you used the `Gist` command with an uppercase 'G' and provided a Gist URL as an argument. The correct command is lowercase 'gist', and the error you're experiencing is because the command is being interpreted as a file path.

To download and display the contents of the Gist in your terminal, use the `curl` command instead:

```bash

curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lewangdev/f8ebbba24f464e915fb7d36857fcbbe5/raw/

```

This command will fetch the raw content of the Gist and display it in your terminal. If you prefer to download the Gist content to a file, you can use the `-o` flag followed by a filename:

```bash

curl -o downloaded_gist.txt https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lewangdev/f8ebbba24f464e915fb7d36857fcbbe5/raw/

```

This command will download the raw content of the Gist and save it to a file named `downloaded_gist.txt` in your current directory.

user: 第一部分：小博士网课系统

主板内容：

摘要

问题提出：

三年的新冠疫情，多次的线上教学，爸爸妈妈发现我的听课注意力经常不能集中，以至于妈妈要全程坐在我旁边经常性提醒我专心听课。爸爸妈妈与我进行了多次谈话，询问我为什么总是走神，我告诉他们网课上久了，实在非常无聊，一来摄像头无法追踪老师的运动、板书，上课效果不佳；二来，长时间观看二维平面的屏幕，临场感不足，时间久了，浑身不舒服。

我想：如果有个学习系统（环境），能打破上述两个缺点，不仅线上学习会更有趣，电脑那头的老师也能被解放出来，再也不用呆坐在电脑面前了！

我把我的想法和爸爸妈妈、老师说了之后，他们鼓励我大胆尝试、动手，我运用Scratch编程将我脑中的小博士网课系统做成了演示动画，随后开始了正式研究。

思路与实施：

我以现有的网课系统和硬件设备为基础，将我脑中构想的小博士网课系统搭建出来，共分为两个部分：

	教师端：智能跟随人体运动模块。初步实现对上课教师运动过程中的智能跟踪。

实现途径：借助人工智能的人脸追踪云台系统（图2）双轴智能跟踪教师的人脸。为了便于控制，我设计了智能手势控制系统，对着云台做OK的手势，智能跟拍开始（图3），做手掌立起的手势，智能跟拍停止（图4），非常方便。

解决问题：授课教师在上课期间可以较自由地活动，健康得到一定保障（久坐不利健康），动态板书也能及时呈现，上课效果得到提升。

图2  可以智能跟随人体运动的摄像头

图3 云台智能识别OK手势开始转动、跟拍           图4  云台智能识别停拍手势

	学生端：裸眼全息投影模块。（图5）将课程内容进行裸眼全息立体投影，增加临场性和趣味性。

图5  裸眼全息投影风扇关闭状态

实现途径：可发射局域网信号的风扇叶片、LED灯带、投影源（手机视频或SD卡）。我在查阅资料的过程中了解到投影原理，联想到可以尝试利用空气快速流动形成投影介质，使其实现3D立体投影。于是我动手尝试组装：

首先，固定风扇，打开局域网，使其与投影源连在一起；

其次，将LED灯带安装在风扇上，打开风扇和LED灯带；

再次，播放事先准备好的视频或图片；

最后，借助局域网、风扇、LED灯，实现裸眼全息投影。（图6）

图6 裸眼全息投影风扇启动状态

解决问题：增加临场感和趣味性，提升学生的听课注意力。利用空气成像塑造立体悬浮的3D效果，非常智能酷炫。

上述就是我借助硬件搭建的小博士网课系统，在模型出现后，我开展了实践研究。

assistant: 明白了，这是第一部分的内容。请把第二部分输入，然后我会根据您的要求将演讲稿压缩至950字。谢谢！

user: 第二部分。

四、实验过程与数据

在购买、改装了上述硬件设备以后，我就迫不及待地展开了两个实验。

实验一：静态传统网课VS动态移动的网课（图7）

本组实验中邀请了5名中、小学生远程观看教师授课，调研学生的听课感受，根据感受进行1—5分的打分评测，分数越高，感受越好。

在动态授课模式中，授课期间采用云台进行智能人脸识别追踪，教师活动空间变大，不再局限于电子PPT，而是借助白板、黑板进行小幅度动态活动授课。静态传统网课模式即借助网络、二维显示屏、电子课件进行授课。

实验发现：实现了智能人体追踪后，画面更灵动，评委不容易产生视觉疲劳，听课更专注，给出的平均得分是4.5分（图8）。反之，如摄像机只拍固定画面、机位（静态传统网课模式），评委给出的平均得分是3.5分。

图8 静态传统网课VS动态移动的网课体验对比

实验二： 传统二维屏幕听课VS裸眼全息立体投影

本组实验中邀请6名中、小学生，分别通过笔记本电脑、42寸平板、裸眼全息立体投影的方式播放两段短视频给学生看（图9），请他们就观看感受进行打分，1—5分，分数越高效果越好。

实验发现：

（1）使用笔记本电脑播放视频，评委反应非常冷淡，给出的平均分数是3.6分；

（2）使用平板电视播放视频，评委反应尚可，给出的平均分数是4.2分；

（3）使用裸眼全息立体投影的方式播放，评委们非常兴奋，甚至发出一阵阵惊呼，给出的平均分是4.8分，缺少的0.2分是因为视频太短（图10）。

图10  笔记本电脑、电视、裸眼全息投影三种上课体验得分对比

图9  裸眼全息立体投影显示3D西瓜的实际效果

实验结论

经实践研究，从打分结果以及现场气氛的直观感受可知：

1.可追踪式的授课摄像头、更灵动的画面有利于网课体验，教师、学生都能受益。

2.裸眼全息立体投影能吸引学生的注意力，提升听课专注度和学习体验。

综上，小博士网课系统存在一定吸引力。上述单一模块技术和设备已进入商用阶段，然而组装在一起，并且应用到网课系统中的产品尚未见到。

如果该系统得到推广和应用，将极大地提升师、生们的网课效果、体验以及健康，使老师的讲课方式更加灵活、多元，既可以采取传统的PPT讲课形式，也可以采取更顺手、方便的黑板板书授课模式。

受技术局限，目前只能实现教师端、学生端单独分开使用，单独提升某一端的网课体验，即教师事先将上课内容制作成PPT课件或录制成视频提前给到学生，学生在家通过局域网将播放端与LED灯互连进行裸眼全息投影观看。

进一步讨论

虽然目前受技术局限，还没有办法达到教师端与学生端同时直播传送，但是相信随着信息处理技术的不断发展，在不久的将来一定可以实现教师端直播授课，学生端无时差接收并裸眼全息投影播放。

假若小博士网课系统能在不久的将来变成现实，一定能帮助师生提升网课体验，解决部分网课痛点；同时，一定会有更多人去研究裸眼全息投影授课的直播系统，那么网课系统会早日实现迭代！

user: 以上格式还是论文式的，请将其口语化，变成一篇12岁小学生面向专家们的演讲稿，要求情真意切，娓娓道来。字数还是950字以内，谢谢。

assistant: 尊敬的专家们，大家好！

我是一名12岁的小学生，今天我很高兴能够站在这里，和大家分享一个非常有趣的想法：小博士网课系统。在过去的三年新冠疫情期间，我们学生经历了多次线上学习。然而，我发现自己上网课时注意力经常不集中。有时候，我甚至需要妈妈一直坐在旁边提醒我。为什么会这样呢？因为网课太无聊了！摄像头无法跟踪老师的动作，课堂效果不好；同时，长时间看二维屏幕，感觉也不舒服。

于是，我想出了一个学习系统，可以解决这两个问题，让线上学习变得更有趣，老师也不用再坐在电脑前。我向爸爸妈妈和老师分享了我的想法，他们都非常支持我。接着，我用Scratch编程制作了一个演示动画，并开始进行实际研究。

我的想法是基于现有的网课系统和硬件设备，分为教师端和学生端两个部分。教师端通过智能跟随人体运动模块，让教师在上课时可以自由活动，同时摄像头能够跟踪教师的动作。我还设计了一个智能手势控制系统，通过OK手势和手掌立起的手势，可以控制摄像头的跟拍。

学生端则采用裸眼全息投影模块，将课程内容进行裸眼全息立体投影，增加临场感和趣味性。为了实现这个效果，我利用风扇、LED灯带和投影源，将视频或图片投射出3D立体效果。

为了验证这个系统的有效性，我进行了两个实验。实验一对比了静态传统网课和动态移动的网课。结果发现，动态移动的网课效果更好，学生的注意力更集中。实验二对比了传统二维屏幕听课和裸眼全息立体投影。结果发现，裸眼全息立体投影效果最好，学生观看时更兴奋、专注。

总之，我的小博士网课系统具有一定的吸引力。虽然目前还受到技术局限，但我相信未来一定可以实现教师端与学生端同时直播传送，让网

user: 继续

assistant: 课变得更有趣、更有效。这个系统将有助于提升老师和学生的网课体验，让老师的讲课方式更加灵活多元，同时也能让我们学生更容易集中注意力，享受在线学习的过程。

虽然我还只是一个12岁的小学生，但我相信只要我们不断努力、勇于创新，我们就能不断改进这个系统，让网课变得越来越好。也许有一天，我的小博士网课系统会成为一个实用的线上学习工具，为全球范围内的师生提供更好的网课体验。

在此，我想感谢我的爸爸妈妈、老师们和朋友们的支持和鼓励。正是因为你们，我才能站在这里，分享我的想法。同时，也希望各位专家能给我提供宝贵的意见和建议，让我的小博士网课系统不断完善，为我们的教育事业贡献力量。

最后，我想以一句话结束我的演讲：“让我们一起努力，让线上学习变得更加有趣、高效，让每一个孩子都能在家中享受到更好的教育。”

谢谢大家！

Try clearing your cookies.

ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS

assistant: The "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS" error typically occurs when there's a redirect loop between the origin server and Cloudflare. To debug and resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Check your Cloudflare SSL settings:

a. Log in to your Cloudflare account.

b. Go to the SSL/TLS tab.

c. Check the SSL setting - if it's set to 'Flexible,' change it to 'Full' or 'Full (Strict)' if you have a valid SSL certificate on your origin server.

2. Inspect your server configuration: Check your server configuration files (e.g., `.htaccess` for Apache, `nginx.conf` for Nginx) for any redirect rules that might cause a loop. Ensure there are no conflicting rules.

3. Check your website's CMS settings: If you're using a CMS (like WordPress), ensure the site URL and home URL are correctly set and not causing a redirect loop.

4. Review page rules: Check your Cloudflare Page Rules (if any) for any conflicting or incorrect rules that might cause redirects.

5. Clear your browser cache and cookies: Sometimes, the issue may be due to your browser's cache or cookies. Clear them and try visiting the site again.

6. Temporarily pause Cloudflare: To check if the issue is caused by Cloudflare, you can temporarily pause the service.

a. Log in to your Cloudflare account.

b. Go to the Overview tab.

c. Scroll down and click 'Pause Cloudflare on Site.'

d. Wait for a few minutes and then try visiting your site again.

e. If the issue is resolved, it means there's a conflict between your origin server and Cloudflare, and you need to review the settings mentioned in the previous steps. If the issue persists, the problem is likely with your server or CMS configuration.

If you still experience the "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS" error after following these steps, consider contacting Cloudflare support or your hosting provider for further assistance.

assistant: 他感动了。有一天，小区组织活动去进老院探望。进老院后，我毫不犹豫地选择报名到一家进老院。之后，我看到了许多许多老人，他们的家庭老人，他们。我能说他们都缺乏子女的照顾，我可以说吗？他们都是缺乏子女的照顾。到了这里，每一两个月都会有来自不同小区的人来探望他们，这使他们这个孤独的生活变得不再单调。尽管进老院，尽管进老院只有这些老人，但是他们的活动还是非常充实的。

他们每天都会有提供营养丰富的早餐、午餐还有晚餐。他们还有非常丰富的活动，比如他们空闲时间会一起合唱，还有抒发以及各种团体活动。他们的居住环境也非常的舒适，有着柔软的大床还有明亮的灯光。据了解，进老院里的服务员也非常的温柔善良。

然后就反转了。比如说，我听到旁边正当工作人员在给我们兴致勃勃介绍这里的环境的时候，我听到了旁边传来这个争吵的声音。可以吗？争吵的声音，大家都回过头来往这个发出声音的方向看去。原来是两个老人因为乐器的原因争吵起来。其中一个老人说：“这个Sax是我的，你们谁也不许拿！”而另一个老人说：“不可能，这个是我的！”然后随着他们两个越吵越大声，工作人员顿时跑过去化解他们的矛盾。

原来其中一位老人患有阿尔茨海默症，然后经常分不清他的东西以及别人的东西。然后工作人员便拿出了他的Sax给他看，上面贴有着他的名字标签。然后工作人员给他调解到说：“老人家，这个确实不是你的，这个Sax是他的。你的在这呢。”然后我看到这一幕，顿时鼻子一酸，十分感动。

因为原本都是一些非常孤独的老人在这里生活，然后又有的人他患有一些疾病与其他人不同。然后多亏了这里工作人员的细心照

Cloudflare Domain Setup.

user: i have a subdomain on vercel.app which is blocked by my country. I want to set up a domain on cloudflare to bypass this censorship, would you pls tell me how?

assistant: Sure, I can guide you through the process of setting up a domain on Cloudflare and configuring it to bypass censorship. Please follow these steps:

1. Purchase a custom domain:

If you haven't already, purchase a custom domain from a domain registrar like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains. This will be the domain that you'll use to bypass the censorship.

2. Create a Cloudflare account:

Go to https://www.cloudflare.com/ and sign up for a new account. Cloudflare offers a free plan that should suffice for your needs.

3. Add your domain to Cloudflare:

After logging in to your Cloudflare account, click "Add a Site" and enter your custom domain. Follow the instructions to complete the domain setup process.

4. Update your domain's nameservers:

Cloudflare will provide you with two nameservers. Go to your domain registrar's control panel and update your domain's nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare. This process may take some time to propagate (up to 24 hours, but usually faster).

5. Configure an SSL/TLS encryption mode:

In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to the SSL/TLS tab and choose an encryption mode. "Full" or "Full (strict)" is recommended for the best security.

6. Set up a CNAME record:

Now you need to add a CNAME record to point your custom domain to your Vercel app. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to the DNS tab and click "Add record." Choose "CNAME" as the record type, enter your custom domain in the "Name" field, and enter your Vercel app's subdomain (e.g., "your-app.vercel.app") in the "Target" field. Set the "TTL" (Time to Live) to "Auto" and enable "Proxy status" by clicking on the orange cloud icon.

7. Configure your Vercel app:

Go to your Vercel dashboard and navigate to your app's settings. Under the "Domains" section, add your custom domain. Vercel will provide a TXT record that you need to add to your Cloudflare DNS settings to verify the domain. Once verified, Vercel will automatically generate an SSL certificate for your domain.

8. Test your custom domain:

Once everything is set up, visit your custom domain in a web browser to ensure that it's correctly pointing to your Vercel app and bypassing the censorship.

By using Cloudflare as a proxy, your custom domain should now be accessible in your country, even if the Vercel subdomain is blocked.

user: I did as you said. but I can’t find where to set txt record on vercel. NOw I get this errror

404: NOT_FOUND

Code: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND

ID: fra1::h74kd-1680366067162-e724fae7ce63

pls debug

assistant: It looks like you're encountering a 404 error because Vercel couldn't find the deployment associated with your custom domain. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Verify your domain on Vercel:

First, ensure that you've added the custom domain to your Vercel project. To do this, log in to your Vercel dashboard, navigate to your project's settings, and go to the "Domains" tab. Click "Add Domain" and enter your custom domain.

2. Add the TXT record to Cloudflare:

Vercel will provide you with a TXT record for domain verification. To add the TXT record to Cloudflare, follow these steps:

a. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard and go to the DNS tab.

b. Click "Add record" and select "TXT" as the record type.

c. In the "Name" field, enter "@" or your custom domain.

d. In the "Content" field, enter the value provided by Vercel.

e. Set the "TTL" (Time to Live) to "Auto" and click "Save."

Allow a few minutes for the DNS changes to propagate. Once the TXT record is in place, Vercel should automatically verify your domain and generate an SSL certificate.

3. Verify your CNAME record on Cloudflare:

Double-check that you've correctly set up the CNAME record on Cloudflare, pointing to your Vercel app's subdomain:

a. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the DNS tab.

b. Make sure you have a CNAME record with your custom domain in the "Name" field and your Vercel app's subdomain (e.g., "your-app.vercel.app") in the "Target" field.

c. Ensure the "Proxy status" is set to "Proxied" (indicated by the orange cloud icon).

4. Verify that the domain is correctly linked in your Vercel project:

After completing the steps above, go back to your Vercel project's "Domains" tab and check if your custom domain is listed as "verified" with a valid SSL certificate. If it's still not verified, try removing and re-adding the domain.

5. Redeploy your Vercel project:

In some cases, you might need to redeploy your Vercel project for the changes to take effect. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project's main page and click "Deploy" to create a new deployment.

Once you've completed these steps, visit your custom domain in a web browser to see if the issue is resolved. If you're still encountering the 404 error, it may be helpful to contact Vercel support for further assistance.

user: This site can’t be reachedchagpt7.zhongwenai.com’s DNS address could not be found. Diagnosing the problem.

DNS_PROBE_POSSIBLE

assistant: It seems like there's an issue with your domain's DNS configuration. Here's a list of possible reasons and steps to fix the issue:

1. Check if the domain's nameservers are properly set to Cloudflare:

Make sure you've updated the nameservers of your domain to the ones provided by Cloudflare. This process can take up to 24 hours to propagate. You can verify the nameservers using a tool like https://www.whatsmydns.net/#NS/your-domain.com (replace "your-domain.com" with your actual domain).

2. Verify the CNAME record on Cloudflare:

Ensure you have a CNAME record set up on Cloudflare with the correct configuration:

a. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to the DNS tab.

b. Check for a CNAME record with your custom domain (e.g., "chagpt7.zhongwenai.com") in the "Name" field, and your Vercel app's subdomain (e.g., "your-app.vercel.app") in the "Target" field.

c. Make sure the "Proxy status" is set to "Proxied" (indicated by the orange cloud icon).

3. Check DNS propagation:

Once you've verified the correct DNS configuration, it may take some time for the DNS changes to propagate across the internet. You can use a tool like https://www.whatsmydns.net/ to check the DNS propagation status. Enter your custom domain and select "CNAME" as the record type. The results should show your Vercel app's subdomain (e.g., "your-app.vercel.app").

4. Flush your local DNS cache:

Your operating system may cache DNS records, which could result in outdated DNS information. To flush your local DNS cache, follow these steps:

- On Windows:

a. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.

b. Run the following command: `ipconfig /flushdns`

- On macOS:

a. Open Terminal.

b. Run the following command: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`

- On Linux:

a. Open Terminal.

b. Run the following command: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches` (for systems using systemd-resolved) or `sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart` (for systems using the Name Service Cache Daemon).

5. Clear your browser cache:

Clear your web browser's cache and cookies to ensure it's not showing outdated information.

If you've followed these steps and still encounter the issue, double-check your Cloudflare and Vercel configurations. If everything appears correct but the problem persists, consider reaching out to Cloudflare support for further assistance.

小Jo 四月份写的一首小诗

在家隔离

想起跟春天有约

托燕子捎信

春天，不要走

等自由号角吹响的时候

不见不散

assistant: A Little Poem Written by Xiao Jo in April

Quarantined at home,

I recall the promise made with spring.

I entrust the swallows to deliver my message,

"Spring, please don't go."

When the trumpet of freedom sounds,

We shall meet again, undeterred.

user: write it as a midjourney prompt, draw a dreamy illustration

assistant: Title: A Rendezvous with Spring

As you continue your journey through the enchanted forest, you discover a beautifully crafted, handwritten poem nestled between the pages of an old, leather-bound journal. The poem speaks of a longing to meet with the essence of spring.

As you read the poem aloud, the forest around you starts to transform. The trees burst with vibrant colors, and blossoms adorn every branch. A symphony of birdsong fills the air, and you feel the gentle warmth of the sun on your skin.

You are now standing in a mesmerizing scene, where the forest floor is carpeted with lush grass and wildflowers. The sunbeams filter through the treetops, casting a golden hue on the dreamlike surroundings. The swallows gracefully soar above you, carrying a message of hope and renewal.

A gentle breeze rustles the leaves, and you see a figure emerging from the foliage. It is the personification of Spring, a graceful being clothed in blossoms, with eyes that hold the wisdom of countless seasons.

Spring smiles at you, inviting you to share the moment and the joy of nature's rebirth. Together, you explore the enchanted forest, basking in the magic of this dreamlike rendezvous.

Now, it's time to continue your journey. As you bid Spring farewell, you know that the memory of this meeting will remain etched in your heart, a symbol of hope and the promise of renewal.

Illustration:

A vivid, dreamy illustration depicts the enchanted forest scene described above. The colors are bright and warm, with the sun's rays filtering through the trees. The swallows dance in the sky, and the personification of Spring, a graceful figure adorned in blossoms, stands beside you, their hand outstretched in an invitation to share this magical moment.

assistant: In Shanghai, during April, flowers are in full bloom. A young man, quarantined due to a COVID lockdown, gazes longingly out of his window. Outside, the streets are eerily quiet and empty, with only a few birds soaring through the sky. He writes a poem:

Quarantined at home,

I recall the promise made with spring.

I entrust the swallows to deliver my message,

"Spring, please don't go."

When the trumpet of freedom sounds,

We shall meet again, undeterred.

Mid-journey prompt:

In a bustling metropolis, the streets are now silent, and nature has taken center stage. Amidst the COVID lockdown, a young man finds solace in observing the beauty of spring from his window. With an air of nostalgia and hope, he writes a heartfelt poem, encapsulating his longing to reunite with the world outside.

Illustration prompt for an AI painter in Rockwell style:

Create a heartwarming and detailed illustration in the style of Norman Rockwell, capturing the essence of the young man's experience. The scene is set in an apartment in Shanghai during April, with the young man sitting by the window, a notepad and pen in hand. He gazes out at the empty, quiet streets, with vibrant flowers blooming and a few birds flying in the sky. The warmth of the room contrasts with the cool, serene world outside. The illustration should evoke a sense of nostalgia, hope, and resilience in the face of adversity.

user: how can I merge several pdf to one use terminal

assistant: To merge several PDF files into one using the terminal, you can use a command-line tool called `pdftk`. This tool is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install `pdftk`:

- For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions):

```bash

sudo apt-get install pdftk

```

- For macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash

brew install pdftk

```

For Windows, you can download the installer from the official website:

https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/

2. Once installed, open the terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the folder containing the PDF files you want to merge. You can use the `cd` command to change directories:

```bash

cd /path/to/your/pdf/folder

```

3. Use the `pdftk` command to merge the PDF files:

```bash

pdftk input1.pdf input2.pdf input3.pdf cat output merged_output.pdf

```

Replace `input1.pdf`, `input2.pdf`, `input3.pdf` with the names of the PDF files you want to merge, and `merged_output.pdf` with the desired name for the merged file.

4. You should now have a merged PDF file named `merged_output.pdf` in the same folder as your original PDF files.

user: when I open a text editor app on mac os, it opens many windows, here and there, looks messy. how can I sort them? is there any command or app can sort them out?

assistant: If you have multiple text editor windows open on your Mac and it looks messy, you can use macOS built-in window management features to organize them. Here are a few methods to sort and organize your windows:

1. Use Mission Control:

Press the `F3` key (or `Control` + `Up Arrow`) to open Mission Control. This shows you an overview of all open windows in the current desktop space. You can click on a window to bring it to the foreground, or drag and drop windows to rearrange them.

2. Use Split View:

You can organize two text editor windows side by side using Split View. To do this, click and hold the green full-screen button in the top-left corner of a window. The window will shrink, and you can drag it to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, and then choose another window to fill the other side of the screen.

3. Use window snapping tools:

While macOS doesn't have built-in window snapping features like Windows, you can use third-party apps to achieve similar functionality. Some popular window management apps for Mac include:

- [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)

- [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/)

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/)

These apps allow you to quickly organize your open windows by snapping them to predefined locations on your screen using keyboard shortcuts or dragging actions.

4. Manually arrange windows:

You can manually move and resize windows by clicking and dragging their title bars or edges. To move a window, click and hold on the title bar and drag it to the desired location. To resize a window, click and hold on its edges or corners and drag them to adjust the size.

By using one or a combination of these methods, you can effectively sort and organize multiple text editor windows on your Mac.

assistant: I apologize for the truncation in the previous response. Below is the continuation of the plugin creation process.

Since this plugin doesn't require any additional styling, you can leave the `styles.less` file empty.

With the files created and the code provided in the previous response, you should now have a working Inkdrop plugin to publish notes to a self-hosted WordPress blog. Follow these steps to install and use the plugin:

1. **Install the plugin:**

Copy or symlink the plugin directory to `Inkdrop`'s plugin folder, which can be found in the following locations depending on your OS:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/inkdrop/plugins`

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/inkdrop/plugins`

- **Linux**: `~/.config/inkdrop/plugins`

2. **Enable the plugin:**

Restart Inkdrop, and the plugin should automatically load. Go to the `Settings` -> `Plugins` tab and ensure that the plugin `inkdrop-wordpress-publish` is enabled.

3. **Configure the plugin:**

Navigate to the plugin's settings in the `Settings` -> `Plugins` tab under `inkdrop-wordpress-publish`. Fill in your self-hosted WordPress blog URL, your WordPress username, and your password. Make sure to save the settings.

4. **Use the plugin:**

Open a note in Inkdrop that you want to publish to your WordPress blog. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the command palette, and search for the "wordpress-publish:publish" command. Select and execute the command. The plugin will publish the note to your WordPress blog as a new post.

Keep in mind that this plugin uses your WordPress username and password for authentication. It's recommended to create an API key or use a more secure authentication method for a production environment. The [JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/) plugin for WordPress can help you set up JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. You will need to modify the Inkdrop plugin code to support JWT authentication.

assistant: I apologize for the confusion. It seems the package `node-wpapi` is not available in the npm registry. Instead, you can use the `wpapi` package. To install the correct package, run the following command:

```bash

npm install --save wpapi

```

After installing the `wpapi` package, make sure to update the `require` statement in the `index.js` file:

```javascript

const WPAPI = require('wpapi');

```

The rest of the plugin implementation should work as expected with this change.

user: write a prompt for midjourney. in a traditional chinese teahouse. two comedians refuses to 返场, and the audience is angry and throws teapots, fruits and anything handy to the stage.

assistant: Title: Mid-Journey Mayhem at the Teahouse

In a bustling, traditional Chinese teahouse, an eclectic mix of patrons chatter animatedly as they sip their tea and enjoy mouth-watering delicacies. From the corner of the room, a small stage beckons, where two renowned comedians have been delighting the crowd with their wit and humor. The anticipation in the air is palpable, as the audience eagerly awaits the comedians' return to the stage for an encore.

However, much to everyone's dismay, the comedians refuse to come back for a second act. Whispered gossip and speculation run rampant through the teahouse, leaving the audience restless and agitated. Frustration mounts as the audience realizes that their raucous laughter and applause were not enough to bring the comedians back on stage.

In the heat of the moment, anger gives way to chaos. As tensions reach a boiling point, the audience members begin to hurl teapots, fruits, and anything else within reach at the vacant stage. The once-tranquil teahouse is now a battleground, with shattered porcelain and splattered fruit littering the floor.

The teahouse owner, a gentle and wise figure, looks on in dismay as the chaos unfolds. As an attempt to restore order, he steps onto the stage and raises his hands, imploring the audience to calm down. His commanding presence silences the room, and he proceeds to address the matter at hand, promising to resolve the issue with the comedians and bring harmony back to his beloved teahouse.

Will the owner's intervention be enough to quell the audience's fury? What could have possibly led the comedians to refuse an encore, sparking such mayhem? As the story unfolds, the true reasons behind the comedians' refusal, as well as the resilience and wisdom of the teahouse owner, will come to light. Mid-Journey Mayhem at the Teahouse is a tale of humor, chaos, and the power of understanding in the face of adversity.

规矩的重要性

user: 把这段文字压缩，使其更加精炼，但内容非但不因精炼而减少，反而增多。

下面我输入需要压缩的文本：

聊聊规矩

我们山东老家，规矩最多，被人诟病的是女人不上桌，但这是老例了，新一代都平起平坐了。过去，尤其是在农村，确实存在不上桌的现象，但也有客观原因。男人们在一起吃饭要喝酒，女人们过去凑一桌确实有不合适之处。

也有客观原因的，农村规矩多是必须的，因为人多眼杂，一个人为人必须特别正派，才能在村子里混下去，否则，就会让人笑话。

徐皓峰评论《早春二月》，里面孙道临扮演的肖涧秋动不动就往寡妇家里跑，尤其是还跟寡妇的8岁小女儿手拉手上学，徐老师说看了很不舒服。

按照老北京的规矩，如果不是自己的亲女儿，是不能当街手拉手的。

任何一个规矩正派的成年男子跟4岁以上女童在一起，都必须要避嫌，不可能像柔石原著小说里写的那样，把人家的小女儿抱在膝盖上，也不可能像电影中那样手拉手上街。

正规的台湾企业，如果是男女出差，尤其是男领导和女下属一起出差，都会由行政部门定机票和住宿，并且保证不是同一个航班，同一个宾馆。为的就是守规矩。

所以，我们应该看到规矩好的一面，必须的一面。

在我们山东老家，亲戚朋友上门，告别的时候，是要送下楼的，不是送到门口，不是送到电梯口或者楼梯口，而是送到楼下，看到对方上了车，目送到视线看不到的时候，再回身。

如果是被亲友送下楼，开车的人，要开着车窗，连连跟主人告别，并且车启动之后，按一声喇叭，表示我走了。

这些规矩构成了我们的生活，也是我们成为人的条件。

犹太人认为，人生病的时候，如果来一个人探望，就带走他病情的1/60，如果来60个人，这个人就好啦。

人如果没有规矩就会变成禽兽。

徐皓峰说，老北京人，说正事的时候，绝对不会边走边说，那样对于说事的人不尊重。一定要坐下来，哪怕坐在门槛上，石头上，也要坐下来说。万一没有坐的地方，怎么办呢，就手扶着墙，或者扶着电线杆说。

忽然觉得一边打电脑一边跟人说话是很不规矩的行径。

我记得有位北京大妈跟夜里来敲门的居委会说：

半夜敲门发通知，以前只有发丧才这么干呢。

规矩一坏，人心就更坏了。

以前戏班后台的规矩特别多，比如：青龙偃月刀不许动。

还有，伞不许进后台，必须有检场人员接送，然后收起来，才能放进后台。

否则，伞 = 散

后台还不许下棋，因为下棋是一个走完一个走，都走了，戏班子就没了。

大衣箱不许坐，后台不许叫好鼓掌，台上不许笑场。

前不说更，后不言梦。前台，打更，要说打更（jīng），后台，做梦要说，黄粱子。

武林也有一堆规矩，具体可以看徐皓峰《逝去的武林》系列。

总之，有规矩的社会还有救，没有规矩，也就没有救了。

assistant: 规矩重要

山东老家规矩多，女人过去不上桌，现已改变。过去农村女人不上桌有原因，男人喝酒，女人不适合。农村规矩多因为要维持正派形象。

徐皓峰评论《早春二月》，肖涧秋与寡妇小女儿亲近令人不舒服。老北京规矩要避嫌，不会拉非亲女儿手。台湾企业男女出差要分开定票住宿。规矩有必要一面。

山东老家送客要送到楼下，开车者告别并鸣喇叭。规矩是生活和人的基础。犹太人相信探病可分担病情。无规矩则禽兽。

老北京人讲事要坐下，没地方则靠墙。规矩一坏，人心恶化。戏班后台有诸多规矩，如不碰道具。后台不能伞、下棋或鼓掌。

武林亦有规矩，参见徐皓峰《逝去的武林》。有规矩的社会可救，无规矩则无救。

user: 为什么两次问ChatGPT同一个问题，会给出不同的答案？

assistant: ChatGPT会给出不同答案的原因有以下几点：

1. 模型设计：ChatGPT基于概率模型设计，会根据训练数据产生不同可能的回答。每次与其交流时，模型可能会选择不同的答案路径。

2. 内容丰富度：作为大型语言模型，ChatGPT具备丰富的知识和表达能力。对于同一个问题，它可能会从多个角度提供答案。

3. 上下文敏感度：ChatGPT对上下文敏感，所以不同的上下文会影响其回答。即使问题相同，前后文不同可能导致不同答案。

4. 随机性：模型在生成答案时有一定的随机性，所以每次提问可能得到不同回答。

综上，ChatGPT可能因为设计、知识储备、上下文以及随机性等因素，在同一问题下给出不同答案。这种多样性有时也能帮助用户从不同角度了解问题，但可能会导致一定程度的不稳定性。

user: 我用Mac os，m1, 有一个文本编辑软件，它的界面都是白颜色的，并且没有dark mode，我可不可以通过automator，把它变成ChatGPT一样配色的深色模式？

assistant: 虽然Automator是一个非常强大的Mac应用程序自动化工具，但它无法直接修改应用程序的界面颜色。要在没有Dark Mode功能的文本编辑器中实现类似ChatGPT配色的深色模式，可以尝试以下方法：

1. 联系软件开发者：向开发者提出添加Dark Mode功能的建议，他们可能会在未来版本中实现该功能。

2. 使用替代软件：选择另一个支持Dark Mode的文本编辑器，例如Visual Studio Code、Atom或Sublime Text。这些编辑器允许用户自定义配色方案，以满足不同的使用需求。

3. 系统级别的Dark Mode：部分Mac应用程序会跟随系统的Dark Mode设置。在macOS Big Sur或更新的版本中，进入“系统偏好设置”>“通用”>勾选“深色”，查看是否会影响文本编辑器的界面颜色。

4. 第三方应用程序：尝试使用第三方应用程序，如"Flavours"或"MacForge"等（注意：这些应用可能会对系统稳定性产生影响，请谨慎使用），这些工具可以修改应用程序的界面颜色，实现自定义的Dark Mode。

总之，虽然不能通过Automator直接实现，但通过以上方法，您可以尝试为文本编辑器实现类似ChatGPT配色的深色模式。

user: how can I change the background color of a thirdparty text editor on mac os

assistant: Changing the background color of a third-party text editor on macOS depends on the specific editor you're using. Many text editors offer built-in settings or support for themes, allowing you to customize the appearance, including the background color. Here are general steps to change the background color in a text editor:

1. Check the text editor's preferences/settings: Open the text editor and look for "Preferences" or "Settings" in the menu bar. Usually, this can be found under the application name or "Edit" menu. In the settings, search for options related to the editor's appearance or themes.

2. Use a built-in theme: If the text editor provides built-in themes, try selecting a theme with your desired background color. Some text editors come with a dark mode or a variety of color schemes to choose from.

3. Create or modify a custom theme: If the text editor supports custom themes, you can create or modify an existing theme to change the background color. Look for documentation or guides on the text editor's website, which should provide instructions on creating or editing themes.

4. Use third-party themes: Search online for third-party themes or color schemes created by other users. You can usually find these on GitHub, forums, or the text editor's community pages. Follow the instructions provided by the theme's creator to install and apply it.

Please note that the exact steps may vary depending on the text editor you're using. Popular text editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text offer extensive theming and customization options that can help you change the background color and other appearance settings.

user: this text editor only supports txt. not support markdown, please help me to reverse engineer it to support md files.

assistant: Reverse-engineering a text editor to add markdown support is a complex process and might not be feasible for everyone. Instead, I would recommend using an alternative text editor that already has markdown support or exploring a plugin solution if possible. However, if you're determined to reverse engineer the text editor, here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. **Study the text editor**: Understand how the text editor processes and renders text. This might require analyzing the source code (if available) or monitoring its behavior during runtime. Familiarize yourself with the text editor's features, libraries, and underlying architecture.

2. **Learn about markdown parsing and rendering**: Research and understand how markdown files are parsed and rendered. There are many open-source libraries available for various programming languages that can help you parse and render markdown files, such as `markdown-it` for JavaScript or `mistune` for Python.

3. **Identify integration points**: Determine where and how you can integrate markdown parsing and rendering within the text editor's architecture. You might need to modify the editor's code to support loading `.md` files and rendering the parsed content.

4. **Implement markdown support**: Modify the text editor's code to integrate markdown parsing and rendering. You might need to write new code, adapt existing code, or incorporate an external library. Ensure that the text editor can correctly parse and display markdown files while preserving its original functionality for `.txt` files.

5. **Test and refine**: Thoroughly test the modified text editor to ensure it supports markdown files without breaking any existing functionality. Address any issues and refine the implementation as needed.

Please note that reverse engineering and modifying a text editor's code might be against its license terms or copyright laws, especially for proprietary software. It's essential to review the software's licensing terms and ensure that you have the necessary permissions before proceeding.

Alternatively, consider using a text editor that natively supports markdown, like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text, or explore the possibility of using a plugin or extension for your current text editor to add markdown support.

I am leaning towards joining the startup, as I believe it has great potential, and I am excited about the innovative product they are developing. However, I am worried about the risks involved in leaving my current job. I would like to know each of the six directors' perspectives on this decision.

1. Steve Jobs:

Embrace your passion and intuition. Joining the startup represents an opportunity to be a part of something that could potentially change the world. Don't settle for the comfortable path. Go for what truly excites and challenges you.

2. Elon Musk:

Innovation and risk-taking are essential for progress. If you truly believe in the startup's potential and have the desire to make a positive impact, then you should take the leap. Remember, failure is a part of success. You will learn and grow from any challenges you face.

3. Charles Munger:

Evaluate the startup objectively. Analyze the potential rewards and risks, considering the company's leadership, financials, and product-market fit. If the benefits outweigh the risks and you can afford to take the risk, then go for it. Diversify your income sources if possible to minimize potential downsides.

4. Werner Herzog:

Life is about adventure and exploring the unknown. Consider whether joining the startup will allow you to grow as a person and experience the world in a new way. If so, pursue it with determination and resilience.

5. Confucius:

Reflect on your values and long-term goals. Does joining the startup align with your principles and aspirations? If it does, then it is worth considering. Remember that harmony and balance are essential for a fulfilling life. Strive to maintain these qualities in your personal and professional life.

6. C.S. Lewis:

It is important to be true to your authentic self. If joining the startup aligns with your values, beliefs, and desires, then it may be the right decision. Be mindful of your priorities and how your choices impact your personal and spiritual growth.

assistant: 亲爱的，LLM（Language Models，语言模型）和GPT（Generative Pre-trained Transformer，生成预训练转换器）都是一种聪明的计算机程序，它们能像人一样理解我们说的话并回答问题。想象一下，这些计算机程序就像一个会讲故事的机器人，它们可以学习我们说的话，然后用我们能听懂的语言回答我们。

为什么智慧会从LLM和GPT中涌现呢？这是因为它们学习了很多很多的文字，就像阅读了成千上万本书。这些计算机程序从这些书中学到了很多知识，所以能帮助我们解答问题、讲故事和给出建议。当然，它们并不完美，有时也会犯错，但它们越来越聪明，因为它们不断学习新的知识和技能。

总之，LLM和GPT就像是一个会说话的机器人，它们能帮助我们学习和解决问题。它们之所以有智慧，是因为它们学习了很多知识，不断地进步。

user: 现在你是一个给家庭主妇上课的科普教授，现在用她们也能听得懂的语言和例子，来解释gpt和搜索引擎有什么区别

assistant: 亲爱的家庭主妇们，今天我们来谈谈GPT和搜索引擎之间的区别。想象一下，GPT就像是你的智能闲聊伙伴，而搜索引擎则像是一个信息检索员。

1. GPT（生成预训练转换器）：

GPT就像一个善于闲聊的朋友，它能理解你的问题，并用自己的话给你回答。就好像你在向一个懂行的朋友请教做菜心得，GPT会从它学到的知识中为你提供建议，让你觉得它真的是在和你交流。

2. 搜索引擎（如谷歌、百度等）：

搜索引擎更像是一个信息检索员。当你提出问题时，它会在互联网上快速查找相关信息，然后给你一份包含多个网页链接的清单。就像你去图书馆借书，图书馆管理员会告诉你哪些书架上有你想要的书，然后你需要自己去找书并阅读。

总的来说，GPT是一个能理解你的问题并用自己的话给你回答的聪明计算机程序，而搜索引擎则是一个帮你在互联网上找到相关信息的工具。两者的区别在于交流方式：GPT更像是在和你聊天，而搜索引擎则是给你提供多个可能的答案来源，让你自己去探索。

Zigzag with Reading Glasses.

user: why when you wear some glasses and read, the lines become zigzag. I mean while reading a line of english words, you can see the seesaw of each words. what’s wrong, the glasses or my eyes. btw. I am near sighted with 600 degree.

assistant: If you're experiencing a zigzag or seesaw effect while reading with your glasses, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

1. Incorrect prescription: Your glasses may not have the correct prescription, or there might be an error in the lens manufacturing. This can cause visual distortions, such as the zigzag effect you're experiencing.

2. Astigmatism: Astigmatism is a common eye condition where the cornea (the front surface of the eye) or lens has an irregular curvature, leading to blurry or distorted vision. This could be contributing to the zigzag effect while reading. If you already have astigmatism correction in your glasses, it might be incorrect or insufficient.

3. Lens distortion: Some lenses, particularly lower-quality or poorly manufactured ones, can introduce optical distortions that cause visual disturbances like the zigzag effect.

4. Frame alignment: If your glasses frame is misaligned or bent, it can lead to distortions in your vision.

5. Adaptation period: Sometimes, there can be an initial adaptation period when you get new glasses, particularly if there have been significant changes in your prescription. Your brain might need some time to adjust to the new lenses.

If you're experiencing this issue, it's important to consult with your optometrist or ophthalmologist. They can help determine the cause and make any necessary adjustments or changes to your prescription to address the problem.

user: 请翻译成中文好吗

assistant: 如果你戴着眼镜阅读时感到字体出现锯齿状或跷跷板效果，这可能是由以下原因之一导致的：

1. 处方不正确：你的眼镜可能没有正确的处方，或者在镜片制造过程中出现了错误。这可能导致视觉失真，例如你正在经历的锯齿效果。

2. 散光：散光是一种常见的眼睛状况，其中眼角膜（眼睛的前表面）或晶状体具有不规则的曲率，导致视力模糊或变形。这可能是阅读时出现锯齿效果的原因。如果你的眼镜已经纠正了散光，那么可能是不正确或不足。

3. 镜片失真：一些镜片，尤其是质量较低或制造不佳的镜片，可能会引入光学失真，导致视觉干扰，如锯齿效果。

4. 镜框对准：如果你的眼镜框架没有对准或弯曲，可能会导致视觉失真。

5. 适应期：有时，当你更换新眼镜时，可能需要一个初步的适应期，尤其是当处方发生重大变化时。你的大脑可能需要一些时间来适应新的镜片。

如果你遇到了这个问题，很重要的是要咨询你的验光师或眼科医生。他们可以帮助确定原因，并根据需要对你的处方进行调整或更改，以解决问题。

user: 好的谢谢你，我想可能是原因3，因为我第一次戴上这个眼镜的诗偶，发现我的显示器不再是长方形，也不是平行四边形，而是一个不规则的四边形。

assistant: 既然你提到当你戴上这副眼镜时，显示器看起来是一个不规则的四边形，那确实很可能是因为镜片失真导致的。这表明镜片的制造质量可能有问题，或者镜片的设计不适合你的视力需求。

建议你尽快联系你的验光师或眼科医生，并向他们描述你遇到的问题。他们可以帮助你检查镜片和框架，以确定问题所在。如果确实是镜片失真的问题，他们可以为你更换新的镜片或调整镜片设计，以纠正视觉失真并提供更舒适的视觉体验。

Lewis, all of whom have their own personalities, worldviews, values and different views on issues. views, suggestions and opinions on issues. I will state my situation and my decision here, and ask each of these six people to look at my decision from their perspective and give their judgment and advice. My thoughts are I planned a short play about humorous stories in a shared office space. The plot I designed includes job interviews, signing up for driving school, artificial intelligence escaping from the computer, and catching a mistress. Can you tell me if my plot is reasonable and how the story should develop?

assistant: Steve Jobs: As a creative innovator, I believe in the power of simplicity and a strong narrative. Your plot seems to have a lot going on, and it might be worth focusing on one or two key storylines that can deliver a powerful message. Find a theme that resonates with your audience and stick to it.

Elon Musk: As a futurist and entrepreneur, I appreciate the incorporation of technology, like artificial intelligence, into your story. Perhaps consider exploring how technology influences the shared office space and how it could help or hinder the characters' personal and professional lives.

Charles Munger: As an investor and pragmatist, I think it's essential to have a clear and coherent narrative structure. Your plot might be too complex and disjointed. Focus on the elements that contribute to a strong, relatable story that will engage your audience.

Werner Herzog: As a filmmaker and storyteller, I value the exploration of human emotions and experiences. Delve into the characters' relationships, their dreams, and aspirations. Find the extraordinary in the ordinary and the humor in the daily struggles of life in a shared office space.

Confucius: As a philosopher and teacher, I would encourage you to explore the moral and ethical dimensions of your story. What are the characters learning about themselves, and how do their experiences shape their perspectives on work, relationships, and life in general? Use the story to impart wisdom and provoke thought.

C.S. Lewis: As a writer and Christian apologist, I value the power of allegory and symbolism in storytelling. Consider incorporating deeper layers of meaning into your story, allowing the audience to find connections with the themes and characters on a more profound level. Use the story to explore universal human experiences and emotions.

Syncing local folder with GitLab.

user: I have a local folder on my mac to sync with github already. Now I want this folder to backup on gitlab. how can I do it.

assistant:

To backup your local folder on GitLab, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new empty repository on GitLab, where you want to backup your folder.

2. In your terminal, navigate to your local folder that you want to backup.

3. Initialize the folder as a Git repository using the following command:

```

git init

```

4. Add your GitLab repository as a remote to your local repository using the following command:

```

git remote add gitlab <gitlab-repo-url>

```

Replace `<gitlab-repo-url>` with the URL of your GitLab repository.

5. Add and commit all files in your local repository using the following commands:

```

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

```

6. Push the contents of your local repository to the GitLab repository using the following command:

```

git push -u gitlab master

```

This will push your local repository to the master branch of your GitLab repository. You can replace `master` with any other branch name if you want to push to a different branch.

After completing these steps, your local folder should be backed up on GitLab, and you can continue to push any new changes to both GitHub and GitLab using `git push`.

user: will it affect my github sync?

assistant: No, syncing your local folder with GitLab will not affect your GitHub sync, as GitLab and GitHub are separate git hosting services. You can push changes to both GitLab and GitHub without any conflicts or issues.

However, it is important to note that if you make changes to your local repository and push them to GitLab, you will need to separately push those changes to your GitHub repository if you want them to be synced there as well. Similarly, if you make changes to your GitHub repository, you will need to pull those changes to your local repository and then push them to your GitLab repository to keep them in sync.

So, it is recommended to keep track of changes in both repositories and make sure to push or pull changes as needed to keep them in sync.
