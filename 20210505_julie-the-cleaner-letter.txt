Julie wrote in her note: "Hi ladies, tomorrow will be my last clean for HSBC. I have made up a bucket of cleaning materials for the next cleaner whoever that may be!

"I've left the job after the way you dressed me down in the office.

"It was nothing more than aggressive and cruel but that's a reflection on your character, not mine.

"So going forward, please all of you remember: in a world when you can be anything, BE KIND.

"Because you are all no better than the cleaner."
