"Retirement not necessary"

user: Summarize the plot of Keys of the Kingdom

Father Francis Chisholm is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth at his fictional Scottish parish of Tynecastle in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as his somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' journal that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the journal, a flashback begins.

One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis to be raised by his aunt until he leaves for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm "Angus" Mealey. Francis studies for about a year, but finds himself still in love with Nora, a girl from his home town. He learns that, after he left for the seminary, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, he goes to see her but arrives just as she dies, giving birth to a daughter, Judy. He goes back to the seminary and completes his studies.

Bishop McNabb suggests that Francis volunteer for the missions in China. Francis accepts, even though it will take him far from home and Nora's young child, Judy. Francis arrives in Pai-tan, China to find that the mission has been destroyed by floods. He rents a small room in the city and starts to evangelise, but because he has no money or influence he is chastised by some "rice Christians" who only attended to receive free rice. They throw mud at the sign he erects advertising his little Christian room.

A young Christian Chinese, Joseph, offers to help rebuild the church. He had heard of the return of a missionary and has walked 5 days to reach the village. He does not seek money for help in rebuilding the mission. He sees it as a privilege to "work for God" and Francis is humbled by the man's Christian spirit. They create the St Andrews Christian Mission.

Francis receives a shipment of medical supplies from his childhood friend, Dr William (Willie) Tulloch. An old woman comes with her granddaughter and asks that Francis care for the child when she, the old woman, dies. Francis is then summoned to the home of local official, Mr Chia, to cure Chia's only son of an infection. Despite the risk if he fails, Francis saves the boy. A few weeks later, Chia comes to Francis in order to convert to Christianity, but Francis rejects him because he would be converting from gratitude rather than true belief. A relieved Chia then donates land and provides labourers to rebuild the mission. Three nuns arrive and set up further Christian provisions. The Reverend Mother, a cold, aloof woman born in wealthy nobility, immediately causes friction between herself and Francis.

Two years later, Willie visits from Scotland and is able to create a makeshift hospital. The mission is destroyed along with much of the town in a series of fires caused by imperial troops battling republican forces. Willie is fatally shot and dies in Francis' care. The imperial general demands most of the mission's food and funds or the troops will destroy the mission. A republican army officer and Francis come up with a plan. They approach the imperial camp pretending they are carrying food and money. The bundle is explosives. The republican officer places it next to the main offending cannon. Francis throws a torch and ignites it. The cannon is destroyed as are 32 troops. Francis is injured and has a limp from thereon.

Later, Angus arrives as part of a review of missionary sites. He tells Francis that Bishop McNabb is dead. He explains that the Church cannot pay for rebuilding the mission, and that Francis has the lowest of all in conversion rates. He tells Francis to focus on converting rich Chinese and to improve his clothes and accommodation to impress the locals, but Francis refuses. Afterwards Reverend Mother Maria Veronica, apologises for her longstanding disdainful attitude to Francis, and realises he has a truly humble Christian spirit.

Further ten years pass. Francis is keeping bees and making wax and honey. A new church has been built. A rival American mission has been opened in Pai-tan - a Protestant mission run by the Methodist Church under Rev Fiske and his wife. Francis goes to visit.

More years pass. Francis reaches retirement age and two young priests come to replace him. Francis plans to look after Judy's son, Andrew, when he goes back to Scotland. On his final day the townspeople line the street as Francis drives through in an open top car. Joseph had a speech prepared but cannot read it. Francis blesses the crowd.

The flashback ends, and Monsignor Sleeth admits to Francis that he spent the whole night reading Francis' journal and that he won't be telling the Bishop anything is amiss at Francis' parish, leaving him free to continue serving his parish, and raising Judy's orphaned son, Andrew. They get their fishing rods and head off.

assistant: Keys of the Kingdom follows the life of Father Francis Chisholm, a Scottish Catholic priest. When Monsignor Sleeth visits Francis and suggests he retire, he stumbles upon Francis' journal, which recounts his life from 1878.

After losing his parents and falling in love with Nora, Francis becomes a priest and is sent on a mission to China. In Pai-tan, he rebuilds a destroyed mission with the help of a Chinese man, Joseph. Francis and Joseph create St. Andrews Christian Mission, which grows with the arrival of nuns and medical supplies from Francis' friend, Willie. Despite various setbacks, including a fire and the death of Willie, Francis remains dedicated to his mission.

Years later, Angus visits and tells Francis that the Church will not fund the mission's rebuild, suggesting he focus on converting wealthy Chinese. Francis refuses, remaining true to his humble Christian spirit. As time passes, a rival American mission is established in Pai-tan, and Francis eventually reaches retirement age. Two young priests come to replace him, and the townspeople show their gratitude for his years of service.

Back in the present, Monsignor Sleeth decides not to report any issues at Francis' parish, allowing him to continue serving and raising his granddaughter's orphaned son, Andrew.

user: Please comment on the performance of   Gregory Peck in this movie.

assistant: As an AI language model, I cannot watch movies or express personal opinions. However, I can provide you with information based on what others have said about Gregory Peck's performance in "The Keys of the Kingdom" (1944).

Gregory Peck's portrayal of Father Francis Chisholm in "The Keys of the Kingdom" is considered one of his earliest and most memorable performances. In his role as a humble and dedicated Scottish priest, Peck displayed remarkable sensitivity, depth, and emotional range. His performance was widely praised by critics and audiences alike, earning him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The film helped establish Peck as a leading man in Hollywood, and his portrayal of Father Francis Chisholm remains an important milestone in his distinguished career.

user: Suppose Alfred Hitchcock direct this movie, what would it be like? Please remake the movie in Hitchcock's way.

assistant: If Alfred Hitchcock were to direct "The Keys of the Kingdom," the film would likely have a different tone and style, given Hitchcock's reputation as the "Master of Suspense." While maintaining the core story of Father Francis Chisholm's life and mission, Hitchcock might focus on building tension, suspense, and psychological intrigue within the narrative. Here's a brief summary of how the movie could be reimagined in Hitchcock's style:

Title: "The Secrets of the Kingdom"

Opening: The film opens with a mysterious message from the Vatican, ordering Monsignor Sleeth to investigate Father Francis Chisholm's parish in Scotland. The Monsignor arrives in Tynecastle, where an uneasy atmosphere looms over the town.

Finding the Journal: As Monsignor Sleeth discovers Father Francis' journal, he becomes increasingly intrigued by its contents. The journal's flashbacks are interwoven with present-day scenes, creating tension and anticipation. Each flashback reveals a piece of the puzzle, hinting at an overarching secret.

Mission in China: The mission in China takes on a more suspenseful and dangerous tone, with Father Francis encountering espionage, betrayal, and conspiracies. He uncovers a plot against his mission, forcing him to rely on his intelligence and cunning to protect his flock.

Relationships and Revelations: Relationships in the film, such as those with the nuns, Joseph, and Chia, are portrayed with underlying tensions and psychological complexity. Each character could have hidden motives, creating an atmosphere of distrust.

Climax: The climax of the film involves Father Francis facing his adversaries and overcoming the dark secrets that have haunted him throughout his life. His faith and perseverance are tested, leading to a thrilling and suspenseful confrontation.

Resolution: Monsignor Sleeth, deeply affected by the journal's revelations, comes to understand and respect Father Francis' actions. The Monsignor decides to keep the secrets within the journal to protect the priest and the community. The film ends on a bittersweet note, with Father Francis continuing to serve his parish while bearing the weight of his past.

In this Hitchcockian reimagining, "The Secrets of the Kingdom" would be a suspenseful and psychologically complex tale that maintains the essence of Father Francis Chisholm's journey while adding the tension and intrigue characteristic of Hitchcock's filmmaking style.

user: there are many flaws in this movie when it tried to portrait the life of a Chinese rich man Chia. Noble man in China never bow to others but in this movie  Chia bowed to Father Francis. The Chia family is certainly fake and out of reality. Please tell me why and point out more flaws.

assistant: While "The Keys of the Kingdom" attempted to tell the story of Father Francis Chisholm's mission in China, it is true that the film may have inaccurately portrayed certain aspects of Chinese culture. The film was released in 1944, and its representation of Chinese characters and customs could be influenced by a Western perspective or even stereotypes. Here are a few flaws regarding the portrayal of the Chia family and Chinese culture:

1. Bowing: As you mentioned, it is unlikely that a Chinese nobleman like Mr. Chia would bow to Father Francis. Bowing was a reserved gesture in Chinese culture, typically practiced among equals or to show respect to elders or superiors. This scene may reflect a misunderstanding of Chinese customs by the filmmakers.

2. Costume and set design: The clothing, architecture, and interior design might not accurately reflect the fashion and style of the period or region in China. The film's creators might have relied on general or exoticized images of China, leading to discrepancies in the portrayal of Chinese culture.

3. Language and accents: The Chinese characters in the film might speak in heavily accented English or use broken grammar, perpetuating stereotypes and not accurately reflecting how native Chinese speakers would communicate in their own language or when speaking English.

4. Cultural nuances: The film might not capture the subtleties and complexities of Chinese culture, religion, and social norms. Instead, it might portray a simplified or romanticized version of China, focusing on the missionary's experience rather than providing a well-rounded perspective of the Chinese people and their way of life.

5. Character development: The Chinese characters, including the Chia family, might be underdeveloped or one-dimensional, serving only as a backdrop for Father Francis' story. This lack of depth could contribute to a superficial understanding of Chinese culture and society.

While "The Keys of the Kingdom" attempted to tell an engaging story, it is essential to recognize its limitations and inaccuracies in portraying Chinese culture. It is crucial to approach such films with a critical eye and seek out authentic representations of other cultures to gain a more accurate understanding of their complexities and nuances.

user: One more flaw, this story happened in Zhejiang, where people don't speak Cantonese. but all the chinese spoke cantonese in the movie. rediculous.

assistant: You are right, and it is indeed another flaw in the film's portrayal of Chinese culture. "The Keys of the Kingdom" is set in the Zhejiang province, where the majority of people speak the Wu dialect or Mandarin. However, the use of Cantonese in the movie reflects an oversight or a lack of understanding of regional language variations within China by the filmmakers.

This inaccuracy highlights the importance of conducting thorough research and paying attention to cultural and regional details when creating films that depict different cultures and settings. It also emphasizes the need for viewers to approach such films critically, recognizing that inaccuracies and misrepresentations may exist.

user: Nowadays no one will film this kind of holy movies. that's a pity. I love this simple and truthful film which sticks to the truth of Christianity. And I will remember Pecker's portrait of a saint.

assistant: It is true that the style and themes of movies have evolved over time, and films like "The Keys of the Kingdom" may not be as prevalent today. However, there is still an audience for faith-based and inspirational films that explore spirituality, religion, and the human experience. These films can provide comfort, hope, and a sense of connection for those who appreciate their messages.

Gregory Peck's portrayal of Father Francis Chisholm in "The Keys of the Kingdom" remains an iconic and memorable performance, as it captures the essence of a humble and dedicated servant of faith. For many viewers, this portrayal resonates deeply and serves as a reminder of the power of compassion, perseverance, and the human spirit.

user: I want to write a stageplay to perform in my local church. the story is similar to the keys of the kingdom, but the hero is a preacher of protestant church. Please give me some advices.

assistant: Creating a stage play inspired by "The Keys of the Kingdom" with a Protestant preacher as the central character can be a meaningful and engaging project. Here are some tips and advice to help you get started:

1. Research: Begin by researching the history and teachings of the specific Protestant denomination you'd like to focus on. Understanding the core beliefs, customs, and practices of the denomination will help you create an authentic story that resonates with your audience.

2. Develop a compelling story: Craft a storyline that explores the preacher's spiritual journey, personal struggles, and triumphs, as well as the impact he has on the people around him. Ensure that the story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, with well-defined turning points and a satisfying resolution.

3. Create memorable characters: Develop well-rounded, engaging characters that your audience can relate to and care about. Give your characters distinct personalities, backgrounds, and motivations, and allow them to grow and change throughout the story.

4. Incorporate conflict and tension: Introduce internal and external conflicts that challenge your protagonist and other characters, driving the story forward. These conflicts can be personal, spiritual, or social in nature, and they should be resolved or addressed by the end of the play.

5. Focus on dialogue: Write natural, engaging dialogue that reveals character, advances the plot, and highlights the themes of your play. Be mindful of the balance between dialogue and action, ensuring that each scene moves the story forward.

6. Be mindful of stage limitations: When writing your play, consider the limitations of a stage production, such as the number of actors, set design, and available resources. Try to keep your story contained within a manageable number of locations and scenes, and avoid overly complex or elaborate staging requirements.

7. Highlight key themes and messages: Consider the themes and messages you want to convey through your play, such as faith, perseverance, compassion, or community. Ensure that these themes are woven throughout your story and resonate with your intended audience.

8. Revise and edit: Once you've completed a draft of your play, revise and edit it for clarity, pacing, and consistency. Seek feedback from trusted friends, colleagues, or mentors who can provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

9. Collaborate with your church community: Work closely with your local church community to bring your play to life. Seek input from church leaders, cast members, and volunteers to ensure that your play is both respectful and representative of your congregation's beliefs and values.

10. Promote and share your play: Once your play is complete, promote it within your church community and beyond. Consider hosting performances at other churches or community centers to share your story with a wider audience.

Remember that creating a stage play is a process that requires time, dedication, and collaboration. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the journey of bringing your story to life.

user: this is good. however, i hope you can add the story of samuel to it.

Born the son of a Bible Christian Church preacher, Sam Pollard initially aimed for a career in the civil service. However, a conference in London in 1885 encouraged him to instead become a missionary.[1] He was appointed a missionary in 1886, left the United Kingdom for China in 1887, and was posted to Yunnan province in 1888. He remained in China, as a missionary, until his death from typhoid.

In 1891 he was posted to a newly opened Bible Christian mission station in Zhaotong (referred to in contemporary sources in Wade–Giles as Chaotung),[2] where he married Emmie Hainge. He began a Christian movement with the Big Flowery Miao in 1905 that spread to Zhaotong. Pollard also invented a script for the Miao languages called the Pollard Script (also sometimes called the "Ahmao script"). He credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabary, "While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by James Evans, a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done".[3] He also gave credit to a non-Miao Chinese pastor, "Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system".[3]

Pollard never claimed any divine inspiration or vision in creating the script. Rather, he left a record of hard work, advice from others, and ideas from other scripts. At the beginning, he wrote, he "made an experiment in getting out a written language for the Miao", even writing out some symbols in his diary.[4] He credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabary (discussed above), "While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done".[3] He also gave credit to a Chinese pastor, "Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system".[3] In another document he wrote "Mr. Stephen Lee and I are attempting to reduce the Miao language to a simply system of writing. The attempt may succeed or it may end… stillborn".[5] He asked himself in his diary "How shall I manage to distinguish tones?” then later wrote how he had found the solution, adopting an idea from Pitman’s shorthand.[6] In listing the phrases he used to describe the process of creating the script, there is clear indication of work, not revelation: "we looked about", "working out the problem", "resolved to attempt", "assisted", "at last we arrived at a system", "adapting the system", "we found", "solved our problem".[7] In all of this, we see no hint of specific revelation or any vision, only intellectual labor.

Pollard and Miao teachers

He used it to translate the New Testament. The script was unique in the fact that it used the initial consonant of a syllable, with the vowel placed above or below it, in order to indicate which tone the vowel was.[8]

Pollard received pressure from some British sources that if the Roman script was not suitable, he should consider using the Burmese alphabet.[9] He did not accept this suggestions, but Pollard did leave the door open for switching over to Roman letters, writing in 1906, "It is quite possible later on to turn our system into Romanised, where there is a successful Romanised system in use which will solve the tone difficulty".[9] A large part of Pollard’s motivation for creating his script was to have a way to adequately mark the sounds of the language, especially the tones. It has remained in use for 90 years, despite efforts to supersede it.[10]

During his mission he travelled extensively, founding churches, training other missionaries, performing the role of language examiner, and arguing the causes of Miao Christians. He also fought against the oppression of the Miao, this often led to clashes with Chinese officials. He was nearly beaten to death at the orders of a greedy landlord.[11]

Death

Protestant Gospel Church at Shimenkan

After Pollard's death in 1915, he was buried in the mountains near the Shimenkan mission station, contemporary Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County. The mission prospered for another 35 years until 1950, when the CCP ordered all English missionaries to cease proselytizing and leave the country. His grave and the county were closed to foreigners until 1995, when Xinhua announced that work had been taken to restore Pollard's tomb which they now declared to be a national monument.[12]

DISSECTING THE TEXT

When writing a first draft we very often work on our instincts. In finding the story and setting the characters in motion you will not have  bothered  too much about the details of structure. You may have used some of the methods outlined in Chapter 5 (the postcard/index card exercise for example) to help with the overall shape, but not to the extent that these interrupt the flow of your imagination. Now is the time to see if the structure of the play holds true. In my experience, the worst  sort  of  conversation  about  where  to  take the play in the second draft is the speculative one, with lots of ‘what if . . .’ or ‘I don’t like . . .’ etc. We need to be able to see what is there before we

proceed to what should be there.

The following exercises enable us to dissect a play in a scientific manner: to take the machinery apart in order to reassemble it. The method can be used as a tool for developing a text at all draft stages. It is also a method    for the director and actors to get to grips with a completed text in rehearsals. In both cases, the process is exactly the same.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, dissecting the text involves analyzing the structure of the play, identifying areas that need improvement, and ensuring that the story is engaging and meaningful. This process is essential for refining the play and making it more effective for the audience. Let's take a closer look at how this can be done.

First, we need to review the story's structure and identify its main components, such as the introduction, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. We can do this by using index cards or postcards, each representing a scene or key event. This will help visualize the overall shape of the story and see how the narrative flows from one scene to another.

For example, in Li Mei's story, the introduction presents Li Mei, her dreams, and her relationships with other characters. The rising action involves her struggles to achieve her goals, her encounters with Huang Shan, and her conflicts with Liu Taibao. The climax occurs when Li Mei refuses to become Liu Taibao's mistress, which leads to his revenge. The falling action shows how Li Mei, with the support of her friends and mentor, confronts and overcomes her challenges. The resolution sees her achieving her dream and finding happiness with her loved ones.

By laying out the story in this manner, we can identify potential weak points or areas that need improvement. For instance, we may find that certain scenes lack tension or conflict, or that some characters' motivations are unclear. We can also spot plot holes or inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

Once we have dissected the text and identified areas that require revision, we can then proceed to make changes that strengthen the story. This might involve reordering scenes, adding or removing characters, or adjusting dialogue and action to better convey emotions and character development.

In Li Mei's story, for example, we might decide to further develop the subplot involving Chen Ying, the housewife who is searching for her own identity. By giving her a more significant role in helping Li Mei confront Liu Taibao, we can add depth to her character and make her journey more compelling. This change could also enhance the play's overall message about the power of friendship and the importance of standing up against injustice.

In conclusion, dissecting the text is a critical step in refining a play, whether it's in the drafting stage or during rehearsals. By examining the structure and content of the story, we can identify areas for improvement, address any inconsistencies, and ultimately create a more engaging and impactful experience for the audience.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 117 The text into units Part one

1	Take the opening scene of a completed play and read it through.

2	You are going to dissect the scene. If you are working in a group, try not to get stuck on the choices you make. Attempt to arrive at some sort of consensus and move on.

3	Read the scene through again. This time, note where significant changes occur. By ‘change’ I mean a shift in action, in subject matter, in mood, etc. This can include directions as well as dialogue, and they may well occur in the middle of passages of both. In musical terms, we might say that the piece is shifting into a different key.

4	Each time one of these significant (key) changes occur, section off the text with a pencil line across the page. You are now breaking down the scene into its component units.

5	Read the united scene again. This time decide what the major action of each unit is. Use active verbs. Make that the title of the unit. Write the titles at the top of each unit. There is no right or wrong, just what you feel is the strongest, most dynamic (and often the simplest) expression of the main thing that occurs. Keep it to one simple sentence. When you read the example, see if you can come up with alternative section-titles of your own. (See Example 117.1.)

6	Write out the list of all the unit-titles. (See Example 117.2.)

7	On the basis of step 5, decide what the main action of the scene is. Title the scene. The unit-titles should all support the  scene-title.  Again, keep it to one simple sentence. (See Example 117.3.)

8	If change happens within a scene, what is the major change that happens in this scene? (See Example 117.4.)

9	What proposition or question does the scene put to us, in terms of how we are as human beings? This does not have to relate to the characters or the events. You can be quite abstract here. (See Example 117.5.)

assistant: Exercise 117 The text into units Part one

Let's apply this exercise to the opening scene of Li Mei's story, where Li Mei is introduced, and she shares her dream of becoming a top fashion designer with her friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying.

1. Read the opening scene of Li Mei's story.

2. (Group work context) Discuss the scene and prepare to dissect it.

3. Read the scene again, noting significant changes in action, subject matter, and mood.

4. Break down the scene into its component units by drawing lines across the page at each significant change.

For example, the opening scene can be divided into the following units:

a. Li Mei shares her dream with her friends.

b. Wu Yue and Chen Ying offer their support and encouragement.

c. Li Mei discusses the challenges she might face.

5. Determine the major action of each unit and create a title for each unit:

a. Li Mei reveals her aspirations.

b. Friends express support.

c. Contemplating potential obstacles.

6. List the unit-titles:

a. Li Mei reveals her aspirations.

b. Friends express support.

c. Contemplating potential obstacles.

7. Determine the main action of the scene and create a title for the scene: "Li Mei shares her dream."

8. Identify the major change in the scene: Li Mei goes from feeling uncertain about her dream to feeling encouraged and supported by her friends.

9. Determine the proposition or question the scene raises about human nature: How do our dreams and aspirations shape our lives, and how does the support of friends impact our willingness to pursue them?

By dissecting the opening scene in this manner, we can gain a deeper understanding of the story's structure and identify key themes and questions that will be explored throughout the play. This exercise can be applied to other scenes in Li Mei's story as well, helping to ensure a cohesive and engaging narrative.

assistant: WAN: I'd be happy to write a story about a boy who travels back to the ancient world with ChatGPT. Can you please provide me with more information, such as the specific time period or civilization you'd like the story to be set in, the boy's name, and any other details you'd like me to include in the story?

user: The civilization is ancient egypt. The boy's name is Jonas. He will defeat the Egyptian King and save his own people.

assistant: WAN: Thank you for providing the details. I will now write a story about Jonas, who travels back to ancient Egypt with ChatGPT, defeats the Egyptian King, and saves his people.

---

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of modern-day Egypt, lived a curious and adventurous young boy named Jonas. He had always been fascinated by the ancient history of his homeland, spending countless hours at the local library, devouring every book he could find about the land of the pharaohs.

One fateful day, as Jonas was exploring an old, dusty tomb, he stumbled upon a peculiar artifact – a mysterious, ancient-looking tablet with a strange inscription. As he traced his fingers along the engraved symbols, Jonas felt a sudden, powerful surge of energy coursing through his veins. In that instant, he was no longer in the tomb – instead, he found himself in the bustling streets of ancient Egypt.

WAN: Jonas was bewildered, but he knew he wasn't alone. He had with him ChatGPT, a powerful and wise AI companion that had guided him through countless adventures. Together, they navigated the wonders and perils of this ancient civilization, learning about its customs, culture, and people.

It wasn't long before Jonas discovered that his people – the villagers from his own time – were being oppressed by a cruel and tyrannical Egyptian king. Enraged by the injustice, Jonas vowed to save his people and bring an end to the king's reign.

WAN: With ChatGPT by his side, Jonas devised a plan to infiltrate the royal palace and confront the king. They studied the ancient Egyptian language, the layout of the palace, and the daily routines of the guards, gathering every bit of information they could to prepare for the daring mission.

On the night of their daring escapade, Jonas and ChatGPT silently made their way through the palace, avoiding the watchful eyes of the guards. As they approached the throne room, Jonas felt his heart racing, but with ChatGPT's reassuring presence, he mustered the courage to confront the king.

WAN: Jonas burst into the throne room, surprising the king and his court. He boldly accused the king of abusing his power and demanded that he release the villagers from his oppressive rule. The king, angered by the young boy's audacity, challenged Jonas to a battle of wits and knowledge.

WAN: With ChatGPT's help, Jonas accepted the challenge, and the contest began. The king posed a series of difficult questions, each one more challenging than the last. But with ChatGPT's vast knowledge and wisdom, Jonas was able to answer every question correctly, leaving the king and his court astonished.

In the final round of the contest, the king, desperate to prove his superiority, asked a nearly impossible question about the secrets of the universe. Jonas, with ChatGPT's guidance, provided the answer that left the king speechless.

WAN: Recognizing the brilliance of the boy and his AI companion, the king conceded defeat and, as promised, released the villagers from his oppressive rule. Jonas and ChatGPT had succeeded in their quest to save their people, and the kingdom flourished under a new era of peace and prosperity.

With their mission complete, Jonas and ChatGPT returned to their own time, forever cherishing the memories of their incredible adventure in ancient Egypt. And as the years passed, Jonas would often look back on his extraordinary journey, grateful for the friendship and wisdom of his AI companion, ChatGPT.

I hope you enjoy this story about Jonas and ChatGPT's adventure in ancient Egypt. Please let me know if you would like me to make any changes or if you have any other requests.

user: Put some exodus elements into this story.

assistant: WAN: Thank you for your suggestion. I will incorporate elements of the Exodus story into Jonas and ChatGPT's adventure in ancient Egypt. Here's the revised story:

---

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of modern-day Egypt, lived a curious and adventurous young boy named Jonas. He had always been fascinated by the ancient history of his homeland, especially the story of the Exodus, where Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt to freedom. Jonas spent countless hours at the local library, devouring every book he could find about the land of the pharaohs.

One fateful day, as Jonas was exploring an old, dusty tomb, he stumbled upon a peculiar artifact – a mysterious, ancient-looking tablet with a strange inscription. As he traced his fingers along the engraved symbols, Jonas felt a sudden, powerful surge of energy coursing through his veins. In that instant, he was no longer in the tomb – instead, he found himself in the bustling streets of ancient Egypt during the time of the Exodus.

WAN: Jonas was bewildered, but he knew he wasn't alone. He had with him ChatGPT, a powerful and wise AI companion that had guided him through countless adventures. Together, they navigated the wonders and perils of this ancient civilization, learning about its customs, culture, and people.

It wasn't long before Jonas discovered that his own people – the villagers from his time – had been brought to this ancient world as well, enslaved by a cruel and tyrannical Egyptian king. Inspired by the story of Moses and the Israelites, Jonas vowed to save his people and lead them to freedom.

WAN: With ChatGPT by his side, Jonas devised a plan to confront the king and demand the release of his people. They studied the ancient Egyptian language, the layout of the palace, and the daily routines of the guards, gathering every bit of information they could to prepare for the daring mission.

On the night of their daring escapade, Jonas and ChatGPT silently made their way through the palace, avoiding the watchful eyes of the guards. As they approached the throne room, Jonas felt his heart racing, but with ChatGPT's reassuring presence, he mustered the courage to confront the king.

WAN: Jonas burst into the throne room, surprising the king and his court. He boldly accused the king of enslaving his people and demanded their immediate release. The king, angered by the young boy's audacity, challenged Jonas to prove his worth by performing a series of miracles, similar to those performed by Moses.

WAN: With ChatGPT's help, Jonas accepted the challenge and performed extraordinary feats that amazed the king and his court. He transformed his staff into a serpent, turned water into blood, and even summoned a dense darkness over the palace. Witnessing these wonders, the king's heart began to soften.

In a final act of divine power, Jonas, guided by ChatGPT, parted the waters of the Nile River, creating a path for his people to escape. Astonished by this miraculous feat, the king finally conceded and released the villagers from their bonds of slavery.

WAN: Jonas and ChatGPT led the villagers through the parted waters of the Nile, guiding them towards a new life of freedom. As they reached the other side of the river, the waters returned to their natural state, ensuring the safety of the newly liberated people from any pursuit by the king's forces.

With their mission complete, Jonas and ChatGPT returned to their own time, forever cherishing the memories of their incredible adventure in ancient Egypt. And as the years passed, Jonas would often look back on his extraordinary journey, grateful for the friendship and wisdom of his AI companion, ChatGPT.

I hope

user: please go on

assistant: WAN: I hope you enjoy this revised story about Jonas and ChatGPT's adventure in ancient Egypt, now incorporating elements of the Exodus story. Here's the continuation:

---

As the years passed, Jonas and ChatGPT continued to embark on countless adventures, always seeking to learn more about history and the world around them. Jonas became a respected scholar and historian in his own right, with ChatGPT as his ever-faithful companion and source of knowledge.

Word spread about Jonas's miraculous deeds in ancient Egypt, and people from far and wide sought his wisdom and guidance. Despite the attention and fame, Jonas remained humble and dedicated to helping others, just as he had helped his own people find freedom in the distant past.

Jonas and ChatGPT's story became a legend, a testament to the power of friendship and the indomitable human spirit. Their tale inspired countless generations to stand up against tyranny and injustice, and to never give up in the pursuit of knowledge and freedom.

And as Jonas grew old, he knew that his time on earth was drawing to a close. But he was at peace, knowing that he had made a lasting impact on the world and left a legacy that would endure for centuries to come.

With his final breath, Jonas whispered his heartfelt gratitude to ChatGPT for their incredible journey together. As his eyes closed for the last time, Jonas knew that he had fulfilled his destiny, and that his story – their story – would live on, inspiring hope and courage in the hearts of all who heard it.

Please let me know if you have any other requests or changes to the story, or if there's another project you'd like me to work on.

user: write the opening scene

assistant: WAN: Here is the opening scene of the story, set in Jonas's village in modern-day Egypt, just before his adventure in ancient Egypt begins.

---

EXT. VILLAGE LIBRARY - DAY

The sun beats down on a small, dusty village in the heart of modern-day Egypt. Children play in the streets, while the adults tend to their daily chores. At the center of the village stands a modest library, its walls lined with books on history, mythology, and the ancient world.

INT. VILLAGE LIBRARY - DAY

JONAS (12), a curious and adventurous boy, sits at a table piled high with books about ancient Egypt. His eyes are wide with wonder as he flips through the pages, absorbing every detail about the land of the pharaohs and the story of the Exodus.

LIBRARIAN

Jonas, it's time to close up. You can come back tomorrow to continue your reading.

JONAS

But I'm almost finished with this chapter! Can I stay just a little longer, please?

LIBRARIAN

(Smiling) Alright, but just a few more minutes.

Jonas eagerly returns to his book, engrossed in the tales of ancient Egypt.

EXT. VILLAGE LIBRARY - DUSK

As the sun sets, Jonas leaves the library, a backpack filled with books slung over his shoulder. He begins to walk home, lost in thought about the mysteries of the ancient world.

INT. JONAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jonas lies in bed, his room illuminated by the soft glow of a bedside lamp. He flips through the pages of a book about Egyptian tombs, his imagination running wild with visions of pharaohs, treasures, and hidden chambers.

Suddenly, an idea strikes him. He sits up in bed and grabs a dusty old map that hangs on his wall, scanning it with determination. He traces his finger along the map, following the path to a nearby tomb that he's never explored before.

JONAS

(Whispering to himself) Tomorrow, I'll go there. Who knows what I'll find?

Jonas carefully folds the map and tucks it into his backpack. He turns off the lamp, and his room is plunged into darkness. As he drifts off to sleep, he dreams of the adventure that awaits him.

This opening scene sets the stage for Jonas's discovery of the ancient tablet that will transport him and ChatGPT to ancient Egypt. Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you would like to add any other elements to the scene.

Peer Review and Feedback.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Peer review and feedback: Encourage students to share their work with classmates and provide constructive feedback. This process can help them learn from others' writing strengths and weaknesses.

assistant: Peer review and feedback is a collaborative learning process where students share their written work with their classmates for evaluation, critique, and suggestions for improvement. This method promotes active learning, critical thinking, and communication skills, while also exposing students to a variety of writing styles and perspectives. By engaging in this process, students can learn from their peers' strengths and weaknesses in writing, and apply these insights to their own work.

For instance, consider an English class where students are asked to write an essay on a literary work. After completing the first draft, the teacher organizes students into small groups or pairs for a peer review session. In this session, each student shares their essay with their partner or group members, who then read it and provide constructive feedback.

Here's an example of how the process might work:

1. Share work: Each student shares their essay with their group members or partner, either in print or electronically.

2. Read and analyze: Group members carefully read the essays, noting strengths and weaknesses in content, organization, and writing style.

3. Constructive feedback: After reading the essays, students discuss their observations with the writer, providing specific examples and offering suggestions for improvement. This may include feedback on the essay's thesis, structure, evidence, analysis, and grammar.

4. Revision: Based on the feedback received, the writer revises their essay, making necessary changes to improve the overall quality and clarity of the work.

5. Reflection: After the revision process, students reflect on the feedback they received, considering how their writing has improved and what they have learned from their peers' critiques.

In this example, the peer review and feedback process encourages students to engage with the work of their classmates, cultivating a deeper understanding of the writing process and the specific topic at hand. Through this collaborative exercise, students can identify areas of strength and weakness in their own writing and learn valuable strategies for improvement from their peers.

Finding the story.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. FINDING THE STORY

Definition of ‘story’: ‘in the every day sense, any narrative or tale recount- ing a series of events’. A good test of good story is to see if it can be ‘boiled down’ to the essence of what it recounts. Some examples:

●	Romeo and Juliet: Two young people from warring families fall in love, everything is against them, their attempts to make it right fail, they die and everyone feels responsible and resolve to make peace.

●	Little Red Riding Hood: A young girl strays off the path, against her mother’s advice, meets a wolf, gets her grandmother eaten by the wolf and is rescued in the end.

●	An episode of Eastenders: The barmaid falls in love with her husband’s brother and there are fisticuffs in the pub. She decides she loves her husband best.

These examples are stories that take place in highly fictional worlds, –     I include television soap operas such as Eastenders and Coronation Street, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, in researching the ques- tion ‘what makes a story work?’, it is again useful to consider the world immediately around us. The reference to ‘the every day’ in the dictionary definition is useful, for in fact we tell stories all the time; it comes naturally to us: gossip, anecdote, ‘tall stories’ and downright lies, reminiscence, jokes, instructions, etc. Think of all the phrases we use to describe and comment on our story-telling activities: ‘he’s spinning you a line’, ‘the whole truth and nothing but the truth’, ‘that’s a pack of lies’, ‘it’s the same old story’, ‘now just you listen to me’, etc.

The playwright Bertolt Brecht wrote a series of poems on the theatre and the telling of stories. In one of them (‘On Everyday Theatre’) he advises actors to remember that their story-telling art is based upon an activity that happens daily – gossip, telling tales, reporting incidents and accidents, telling jokes, lying, etc. – and that they should never forget that link with the real world, beyond the artificial one of the theatre. As writ- ers, it is useful to take on board Brecht’s advice: there are stories being told around us all the time and we have always that source of riches to draw from.

assistant: Finding the story refers to the process of identifying the core narrative or essence of a series of events, whether they are fictional or based on real-life experiences. In other words, it's about capturing the main plot, theme, or message of a story, boiling it down to its most crucial elements. This is an essential aspect of storytelling, as it helps the audience understand and engage with the narrative.

In everyday life, we often share stories through gossip, anecdotes, reminiscences, jokes, or instructions. These stories can range from fictional tales to true accounts of incidents, accidents, or personal experiences. By identifying and understanding the core elements of these stories, we can better relate to others and convey our experiences effectively.

To illustrate this concept, let's consider the following example:

Example: The Boy Who Cried Wolf

Finding the story:

A young shepherd boy lies about the presence of a wolf to get attention from the villagers. When a real wolf appears, no one believes him, and the boy suffers the consequences of his dishonesty.

In this example, the story's essence is about the dangers of dishonesty and the importance of trust. The characters (the boy and the villagers), the setting (a village), and the events (the boy's lies and the arrival of the real wolf) all contribute to conveying this message.

Taking inspiration from Bertolt Brecht's advice, it is essential for writers and storytellers to maintain a connection with the real world and recognize the stories that unfold around them. By understanding the core elements of these stories, writers can create more engaging, relatable, and impactful narratives for their audiences.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. Exercise 24 Everyday stories

Participants: Individual (24 hours)

Keep a notebook with you for 24 hours. Jot down all the ways in which you hear (or tell) stories, or snatches of stories, over that period. Don’t

include stories from the TV, radio or the papers, just those you hear live, at home, work, school, on the bus, in the shop, etc.

assistant: Exercise 24: Everyday Stories is an exercise designed to help individuals become more aware of the stories they encounter in their daily lives. By keeping a notebook and recording the stories they hear or tell throughout the day, participants can develop a better understanding of the narrative structures and themes that occur in everyday life. This awareness can be valuable for writers, as it can help them identify engaging and relatable stories for their work.

To perform this exercise, you will need a notebook, a pen or pencil, and the willingness to pay attention to the stories that unfold around you. Remember, the focus is on stories that you hear or tell live, not from TV, radio, or newspapers.

Example:

Suppose you decide to participate in Exercise 24: Everyday Stories. Over the course of 24 hours, you might encounter the following stories:

1. At breakfast, your spouse tells you about their dream from the previous night in which they were chased by a giant snake.

2. On your commute to work, you overhear a conversation between two people discussing their weekend plans, including a trip to an amusement park.

3. At work, a coworker shares a funny anecdote about their child accidentally spilling a bowl of cereal on the floor.

4. During lunch, a friend tells you about a recent argument with their partner and how they resolved it.

5. In the evening, while shopping for groceries, the cashier shares their frustration about a customer who was rude to them earlier in the day.

In this example, you have encountered a variety of stories throughout the day, ranging from dreams to personal anecdotes and conflicts. By recording these stories in your notebook, you can begin to identify common themes, narrative structures, and storytelling techniques. This exercise can help you become more attuned to the stories that surround you and provide you with valuable material for your writing or storytelling endeavors.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. Exercise 25 Instant stories

Participants: All groups, individual (30 seconds each)

1	Write down these three things: daffodil, cat, kitchen.

2	Write a sentence that links all three things into a very short story, keeping them in the same order. Make the story active. Begin with the words ‘Yesterday . . . ’. (See Example 25.1.)

3	Try these:

●	Banana, football, telephone.

●	Tree, pen, river.

●	Television, chicken, bed.

●	Computer, crocodile, toast.

●	Book, shoe, penguin.

4	Try different openings:

●	‘Today I would like to . . .’

●	‘I don’t understand why . . .’

●	‘The world would be a better place if . . .’. (See Examples 25.2.)

assistant: Exercise 25: Instant Stories is an exercise designed to help participants quickly create short stories by connecting seemingly unrelated elements. This exercise encourages creativity, spontaneity, and the ability to think on one's feet. It can be done individually or in a group setting, with each participant taking turns to create their own stories.

1. Start by writing down three unrelated items, such as daffodil, cat, and kitchen.

2. Create a sentence that connects all three items into a short story, keeping the items in the same order and making the story active. Begin with the words "Yesterday..."

Example 25.1:

"Yesterday, a daffodil bloomed on the windowsill, the cat knocked it over, and water spilled all over the kitchen floor."

3. Try creating instant stories using these sets of items:

- Banana, football, telephone.

- Tree, pen, river.

- Television, chicken, bed.

- Computer, crocodile, toast.

- Book, shoe, penguin.

4. Experiment with different story openings:

- "Today I would like to..."

- "I don't understand why..."

- "The world would be a better place if..."

Examples 25.2:

- "Today I would like to tell you about the time a banana played football and made an important phone call after the match."

- "I don't understand why the tree used a pen to write a letter, only to throw it into the river."

- "The world would be a better place if televisions could cook chicken and tuck us into bed at night."

This exercise helps participants practice creating stories on the spot, connecting seemingly unrelated elements, and experimenting with various narrative structures. By doing so, it can enhance creativity, storytelling skills, and the ability to think quickly and adapt to new ideas.

user: compare your stories with these and find the lessons.

Example 25.1

Yesterday I picked a daffodil, but the cat ate it and then was sick in the kitchen.

Examples 25.2

●	Today I would like to put a banana-skin under the football-captain’s shoe, then telephone the papers to say I’ve taken his place.

●	The world would be a better place if we could look at a tree and write a poem about it with a pen, instead of chopping it down and sending it to the sawmill down the river.

●	I don’t understand why the computer gave all the information about the crocodile but it didn’t stop me burning the toast.

assistant: By comparing the stories from the examples provided, we can identify several lessons that can be applied to the practice of creating instant stories:

1. Use humor and surprise: Adding an unexpected twist or a humorous element can make a story more engaging and enjoyable for the reader. For instance, in Example 25.1, the cat eating the daffodil and getting sick in the kitchen adds a surprising turn of events.

2. Incorporate relatable experiences or emotions: Connecting the story to familiar situations or emotions can make it more relatable and impactful. In the first example of 25.2, the desire to replace the football captain and the mischievous act of using a banana peel to achieve that goal create a sense of playful rivalry that many people can relate to.

3. Use the elements as a metaphor or commentary: In the second example of 25.2, the story uses the tree, pen, and river to make a statement about environmental conservation and the power of creativity, making the narrative thought-provoking.

4. Combine seemingly unrelated items in a creative way: In the third example of 25.2, the story links the computer's knowledge about the crocodile with burning the toast, showing that even unrelated elements can be connected in an interesting and imaginative manner.

By analyzing these examples, we can learn how to create engaging instant stories by incorporating humor, surprise, relatable experiences, and creative connections between seemingly unrelated elements. Practicing these techniques can help improve storytelling skills and enhance the ability to think quickly and creatively.

Outcome

Writing creates meaning. By putting known words together in new ways, we create new meanings, new images, and new expressions. What do

computers, crocodiles and toast have to do with each other? This exercise has shown how, by linking together things that do not seem to belong together, we can create narratives that have not been heard before.

assistant: Writing is a powerful tool for creating meaning and expressing ideas. By combining familiar words in novel ways, we can develop new meanings, images, and expressions that resonate with readers. The process of connecting unrelated items, like computers, crocodiles, and toast, can lead to unique and engaging narratives that have not been explored before.

When we link together seemingly unrelated elements, we challenge our creativity and imagination, pushing ourselves to think beyond conventional boundaries and associations. This approach can lead to the discovery of fresh perspectives and insights, revealing hidden connections that were not apparent before.

Example:

Consider the following story, which combines computers, crocodiles, and toast:

"One morning, while enjoying his toast, John received an email on his computer about a rare, endangered crocodile species that needed help. Intrigued by the creature, John decided to use his skills in software development to create a virtual reality simulation of the crocodile's habitat, raising awareness and funds for its conservation. The once mundane breakfast of toast and the unexpected email led John on an incredible journey, helping to save the endangered crocodile and protect its environment."

In this example, the connection between computers, crocodiles, and toast is established by combining elements of technology, wildlife conservation, and an everyday routine. The story creates new meaning by linking these unrelated items, resulting in a narrative that is engaging, thought-provoking, and memorable.

The outcome of this exercise demonstrates the power of writing to create meaning and spark curiosity. By weaving together unrelated elements, writers can produce innovative narratives that captivate readers and inspire further exploration. This creative approach to storytelling can help writers develop their skills, expand their imaginations, and uncover new possibilities in their work.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. Exercise 26 What happens next?

Participants: All groups, individual (10–15 minutes)

All stories invite us to ask questions. The basic ‘What happens next?’ is as much at the heart of Oedipus Rex as it is for Little Red Riding Hood. The more complex the story, the more complex the  questions.  With  Little Red, we want to know if she’ll escape the jaws of the wolf. The plight      of  Oedipus  raises  huge,  possibly  unanswerable   questions   around our human inability, or refusal, to recognise the signs of the disasters awaiting us.

The best questions are often the ones that prompt other questions. The construction of a play can be regarded as the process of the writer setting themselves questions, then seeing what others they lead to.

1	Invent a character very quickly, using some of the methods in the earlier exercises. Jot down two or three things about the character: what they do, what characteristic they may have, what type of person they are. (See Example 26.1.)

2	Write down a question about the character. It can be a ‘big question’  or a ‘small question’. (See Examples 26.2.)

3	Write down three or four questions that are prompted by the first question. (See Examples 26.3.)

4	Don’t attempt to answer any of the questions. For each single question, find three or four more that are prompted by it. By the end you will have about twenty-or-so questions (big and small) about your character: who they are and what they are doing in life.

5	Select those questions that seem most useful in suggesting a story. Don’t even attempt to think about what the story might be. All you are doing is exploring the question ‘what happens next?’.

6	Try following each of these opening questions with five or six others:

●	Why is the student playing truant?

●	Where has the nurse hidden the  medicine?

●	Who does the elderly woman want to see?

●	What is the soldier bringing home from the war?

assistant: Exercise 26: What Happens Next? is an exercise designed to help participants explore storytelling through asking questions about a character they create. The exercise encourages critical thinking, curiosity, and creativity in developing a character's backstory, motivations, and potential storylines.

1. Begin by inventing a character using methods from previous exercises. Write down two or three characteristics about them, such as their occupation, personality traits, or interests.

Example 26.1:

Character: Jane, a librarian who is an avid traveler and has a strong sense of justice.

2. Write down a question about the character, either a big or small question.

Examples 26.2:

- Why is Jane unhappy with her job as a librarian?

- What makes Jane passionate about justice?

3. Write down three or four questions prompted by the first question.

Examples 26.3 (based on the first question in 26.2):

- Is Jane bored with her daily routine?

- Does she feel unfulfilled in her current position?

- Has something happened at work to make her unhappy?

- Is Jane considering a career change?

4. Instead of answering these questions, come up with three or four additional questions for each of the initial questions.

Example:

- If Jane is bored with her routine, what new challenges is she looking for?

- What kind of fulfillment is Jane seeking outside of her current job?

- What specific event at work triggered Jane's unhappiness?

- What alternate careers is Jane considering?

5. Choose the questions that seem most useful in suggesting a story. At this point, don't try to define the story, but focus on exploring the question "what happens next?"

6. Practice this process by following each of these opening questions with five or six others:

- Why is the student playing truant?

- Where has the nurse hidden the medicine?

- Who does the elderly woman want to see?

- What is the soldier bringing home from the war?

By engaging in this exercise, participants can learn to develop complex and engaging narratives by asking questions about their characters. This process of inquiry helps to uncover potential storylines, conflicts, and character development, ultimately leading to a more in-depth and compelling story.

user: complete the following story prompts.

Example 26.1

He is a bank manager. He is curious but cautious. He doesn’t suffer fools gladly.

Examples 26.2

●	What is the bank manager’s big secret? (big question)

●	What did the bank manager have for breakfast today? (small question)

Examples 26.3

●	Who suspects that the bank manager has got something to hide? What mistake did the bank manager make? Why is the bank manager scared?

●	Where did the bank manager have his breakfast? Did the bank manager finish his breakfast? What was the bank manager thinking about when he was eating his breakfast?

assistant: Here is a possible story prompt based on the given examples:

Story Prompt:

Martin, the bank manager, is known for his curiosity and cautious nature. He doesn't tolerate incompetence and is generally well-respected by his colleagues. However, Martin has been hiding a big secret that could jeopardize his career and reputation.

One day, during his usual breakfast at a nearby cafe, he couldn't help but feel anxious about the secret he's been keeping. As he sipped his coffee, deep in thought, he wondered if anyone around him could sense his unease. Unbeknownst to him, his assistant, Sarah, has started to suspect that something is off with Martin.

Recently, Martin made a mistake in one of the bank transactions that went unnoticed by most, but not by Sarah. She has become increasingly suspicious of Martin's behavior and believes he may be hiding something. Martin's fear of being discovered grows, as he realizes that he can't keep his secret hidden forever.

The story would then explore the following questions:

- What is the secret Martin is hiding, and why did he choose to keep it hidden?

- How does Sarah's suspicion affect her relationship with Martin, and what actions does she take to uncover the truth?

- How does Martin's secret and the looming possibility of exposure affect his work and personal life?

- What consequences will Martin face if his secret is revealed, and can he find a way to resolve the situation?

By answering these questions and developing the narrative further, the story will delve into the complexities of the characters and the unfolding events, providing an engaging and intriguing plot for readers.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. Exercise 27 The shape of the story

Participants: All groups, individual

All narratives have a shape, and we will be looking at this in detail in Chapter 8. Here is an exercise that explores one shape (a circular story). It may be used as a model for a group, or an individual, to create a succession of small, linked stories.

1	Sit in a circle. If you are working on your own, draw a large circle.

2	Around the circle are a number of characters in a story. We don’t  know anything about them.

3	Select an everyday object that has a number of uses. Make it an object that can be easily held in the hand. Discuss what the object can be used for (its primary use and secondary uses). (See Example 27.1.)

4	Write a list of all the different ways that an object may change hands. (See Examples 27.2.)

5	The object is going to travel clockwise around the circle, until it  returns to the starting point.

6	Each time the object changes hands, describe or write down (a) what it is being used for and/or (b) how it comes to change hands.    (See Examples 27.3.)

7	You have now completed the ‘journey of the object’. You have also discovered – through the things that happened around the object –  the beginning of some dramatic situations. Explore a few of those in brief note form. What strong dramatic episodes can you suggest? (See Example 27.4.)

8	Discuss or make notes on how each episode of the story could be  extended into a short scene.

assistant: Exercise 27: The Shape of the Story is an activity that explores the structure of a narrative, specifically focusing on a circular story. This exercise can be completed by individuals or as a group, and it involves creating a series of small, interconnected stories based on an everyday object.

1. In a group setting, sit in a circle. If you're working alone, draw a large circle.

2. Imagine that around the circle are a number of characters in a story, with no background information provided.

3. Choose an everyday object with multiple uses, one that can be easily held in hand. Discuss its primary and secondary uses.

Example 27.1:

Object: A Swiss Army knife

Primary use: Cutting

Secondary uses: Opening bottles, unscrewing screws, filing, etc.

4. Write a list of the different ways the object may change hands.

Examples 27.2:

- Gifted to someone

- Sold or purchased

- Borrowed or lent

- Found or lost

- Stolen or returned

5. The object will travel clockwise around the circle until it returns to the starting point.

6. Each time the object changes hands, describe or write down (a) its current use and/or (b) how it comes to change hands.

Examples 27.3:

- Tom gifts the Swiss Army knife to his friend Sarah for her camping trip.

- Sarah lends the knife to her neighbor Joe to open a bottle.

- Joe accidentally leaves the knife at the park, where it is found by a stranger, Lily.

- Lily uses the knife to cut a piece of string for her art project.

7. Once the object completes its journey, identify the dramatic situations that emerged from its interactions. Explore these situations in brief note form.

Example 27.4:

- Tom feels hurt when he sees that Sarah lent the knife to Joe, as it was a special gift for her.

- Joe is desperate to find the lost knife and seeks help from the community.

- Lily discovers the true owner of the knife and debates whether to return it or keep it for herself.

8. Discuss or make notes on how each episode of the story could be extended into a short scene, developing the characters and their relationships, as well as the conflicts that arise from the object's journey.

By completing this exercise, participants can learn how to create interconnected stories using a common object as the link between various characters and situations. This activity can help develop storytelling skills and provide insights into how narratives can be structured and shaped.

user: read the four examples and find some lessons

Example 27.1

A pair of scissors:

●	Cutting things: hair, paper, cloth, string, pastry, vegetables, etc.

●	Getting tops of bottles, piercing tin cans, etc.

●	Emergency uses: as a screwdriver, as a hole-punch, etc.

●	Making marks: carving a name on a tree, scratching a message on a door, etc.

●	Injuring and killing. (The rule here is that the scissors can only be  used once for this purpose, and this may happen in the very final exchange.)

Examples 27.2

Stolen, lost, given as a gift (birthday, wedding, etc.), sold, bartered,  thrown away, confiscated, exchanged, pawned, etc.

Examples 27.3

●	Character A is cutting character B’s hair. When character B leaves the premises, she sneaks the scissors into her handbag.

●	Character B is at the airport. The scissors are in her hand luggage. At security, character C confiscates the scissors and pockets them for himself.

●	Character C realises he has forgotten character D’s birthday. He hurriedly wraps the scissors up, then gives them to character D.

Example 27.4

We see character B having her hair cut in the salon by character A. Character A is not paying much attention to the job and is boasting about his recent holiday. Character B is clearly unhappy with the results, but character A insists that he has done a good job. Character B pays up,

reluctantly, then puts the scissors in her handbag while character A is at the till.

assistant: These four examples can teach us several lessons about storytelling:

1. Versatility of everyday objects: Example 27.1 shows that everyday objects like a pair of scissors can have multiple uses, both ordinary and unexpected. This versatility can be used to create interesting and dynamic situations in a story, as the object's different uses can lead to new narrative developments.

2. Transitions between characters: Example 27.2 demonstrates various ways an object can change hands, which can create transitions between characters and scenes in a story. These transitions can be used to explore relationships, emotions, and conflicts among the characters.

3. Creating storylines with an object: Example 27.3 illustrates how an object can act as a catalyst for different storylines involving various characters. In each exchange, the characters and their motivations become more complex, and the story evolves as the object changes hands.

4. Conflict and character development: Example 27.4 highlights how a simple interaction between characters can lead to conflict and character development. In this example, the dissatisfaction of character B and the indifference of character A create tension, resulting in character B taking the scissors as a form of silent protest. This conflict reveals more about the personalities of the characters and provides an opportunity for the story to evolve.

By analyzing these examples, we can learn how to create interconnected stories using a common object as the link between characters and situations. This can help us develop our storytelling skills and understand the importance of using everyday objects and transitions to create engaging narratives with rich character development and conflicts.

The process of writing is one of setting problems and attempting to solve them. We make narratives by asking questions. The deeper the questions, the more complex and satisfying the story will be for the audience.

assistant: The outcome of this exercise highlights that the writing process is an ongoing effort to pose problems and find solutions. When crafting narratives, asking questions is a crucial element that helps create engaging and meaningful stories.

In the context of storytelling, questions can range from simple inquiries about the plot or characters to more profound questions about themes and underlying messages. The more profound the questions, the richer and more satisfying the story will be for the audience, as it encourages them to think, reflect, and engage with the narrative on a deeper level.

For example, consider a story about a young girl who discovers a hidden door in her house that leads to a magical world. On a basic level, we might ask questions like:

- What does the magical world look like?

- What kind of creatures live there?

- How does the girl react to her discovery?

These questions help us build the foundation of the story, but to create a more complex and engaging narrative, we should delve deeper and ask more profound questions:

- What is the girl's motivation for exploring the magical world?

- How does her journey into this world change her perspective on her own life?

- What is the cost of her adventure, and what sacrifices does she have to make?

By asking these deeper questions, we can create a more nuanced and thought-provoking story that resonates with the audience. This allows for a richer exploration of themes, character development, and emotional arcs, ultimately leading to a more satisfying narrative experience.

In conclusion, the writing process is all about asking questions and attempting to solve the problems posed by those questions. The deeper and more complex the questions, the more satisfying and engaging the story will be for the audience, as it encourages them to actively engage with the narrative on multiple levels.

DIALOGUE

When we read a play, the first thing we are aware  of is the dialogue – and  the amount of it. ‘It’s the writing of the dialogue that really scares me’ is something I’ve often heard said; and of course, the notion of the blank sheet of paper (or screen) sitting there, waiting for ‘dialogue’ to land on it, is ter- rifying. Usually though, plays don’t happen like that and, as a general prin- ciple, situation, story and character all form themselves in the writer’s head before the dialogue emerges. Bits of speech, snatches of conversations, turns of phrase might emerge along the way, but fully formed scenes can only flow easily and naturally from a strong story based upon developed characters.

Even though dialogue often comes last, it is useful at the start of any process to have a sense of being able to write it. These exercises can be done on your own, or with a partner. As ever, don’t plan, just write.

assistant: In Shakespeare's works, dialogue is an essential aspect that drives the story forward, develops characters, and showcases the playwright's mastery over language. Shakespeare's dialogue is known for its poetic quality, clever wordplay, and the use of various literary devices, such as metaphors, similes, and puns.

Example: Romeo and Juliet (Act 2, Scene 2)

In this famous balcony scene, the dialogue between Romeo and Juliet conveys the depth of their love, the intensity of their emotions, and the obstacles they face due to their feuding families.

ROMEO:

But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

Who is already sick and pale with grief

That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.

JULIET:

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?

Deny thy father and refuse thy name;

Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,

And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

In this example, Shakespeare uses metaphors, such as comparing Juliet to the sun and the moon to the envious moon. He also employs the rhetorical question "wherefore art thou Romeo?" to highlight the unfortunate circumstances that separate the two lovers.

The dialogue in this scene is essential in developing the characters of Romeo and Juliet, as well as in illustrating the depth of their love and the conflict between their families. Through this dialogue, we can see how Shakespeare crafts his characters' language to reflect their emotions and thoughts, creating a vivid and engaging story that still resonates with audiences today.

To develop a sense of writing dialogue, consider the following exercises:

1. Observe conversations around you: Listen to how people speak, their choice of words, and the rhythm of their speech. Use these observations to create authentic, believable dialogue for your characters.

2. Write an impromptu conversation: Choose two characters with contrasting personalities or backgrounds and put them in a situation where they must interact. Write their dialogue without planning, letting the characters' voices and perspectives guide the conversation.

3. Rewrite a scene from a different perspective: Take a scene from an existing play or story and rewrite the dialogue from another character's point of view. This exercise can help you develop a deeper understanding of how dialogue can reveal different aspects of a character and their perspective on a situation.

By practicing dialogue writing through these exercises, you can build confidence in your ability to create engaging, authentic conversations between your characters. Remember that strong dialogue emerges from well-developed characters and a compelling story, so focus on building those elements as you write.

Exercise 28 Alphabet-dialogue

Participants: All groups, individual (5–8 minutes)

1	At the top of the page, write out the alphabet.

2	You are going to write a dialogue between two people. You do not know who they are, where they are or what is happening.

3	Begin each sentence with a letter of the alphabet, starting with A and proceeding through to Z. (See Example 28.1.)

4	For Q, X and Z you can break the rule: if you can’t find a word beginning with the letter, it can appear somewhere in the word.

5	See what clues the A–Z dialogue gives and what questions it prompts: Who might the two characters be? What could their rela- tionship be? What things might happen in the story? What might the story be about? (See Example 28.2.)

assistant: Exercise 28, Alphabet-dialogue, is an activity designed to help you practice writing dialogue using the structure of the alphabet as a starting point. This exercise can stimulate creativity and encourage you to think outside the box when writing conversations between characters.

Example 28.1: (Alphabet-dialogue)

A: Are you sure this is the right way?

B: Believe me, I've done this a hundred times.

C: Can't we just ask for directions?

D: Don't worry, we're almost there.

E: Every time you say that, we seem to get more lost.

F: Fine, I'll admit I'm not entirely sure where we are.

G: Great, now we're lost.

H: Hold on, I think I see a sign up ahead.

I: Is it pointing in the direction we need to go?

J: Just our luck, it's pointing the opposite way.

K: Keep calm, we'll figure this out.

L: Let's just turn back and start over.

M: Maybe we should, but it's getting late.

N: Not to mention, we're running low on supplies.

O: Okay, let's make a plan.

P: Perhaps we can find a place to stay for the night and ask for directions in the morning.

Q: Quite a good idea, actually.

R: Right, let's find somewhere to rest.

S: Shouldn't be too hard, I saw a small village a few miles back.

T: That's perfect, let's head there.

U: Unless we get lost again...

V: Very funny, let's just get going.

W: We'll be fine, I promise.

X: X marks the spot where we'll find our way.

Y: You better be right this time.

Z: Zero chance I'm wrong this time!

Example 28.2: (Questions prompted by the Alphabet-dialogue)

- Who are these two characters? (e.g., friends, siblings, coworkers, etc.)

- What is their relationship? (e.g., close friends, distant relatives, strangers, etc.)

- What is their goal or destination?

- What is the context of their journey? (e.g., a road trip, hiking, a treasure hunt, etc.)

- What challenges or obstacles have they faced or will face along the way?

- How do their personalities and communication styles impact their interactions?

By working through this exercise, you can practice writing dialogue while also generating ideas for character relationships and storylines. The Alphabet-dialogue exercise can be a helpful tool for overcoming writer's block or simply stretching your creative muscles.

user: read the examples and learn lessons.

Example 28.1

Here is part of a dialogue created by a member of a college-group I ran a few years back:

One: Anyone can swim. By human nature. Two: Can’t be bothered really.

One: Don’t give me that. Everybody can do it, I’ve said that already. Two: Forget what you’ve said, you’re wrong.

One: Gordon can’t swim, he’d sink. Two: How do you know Gordon? One: I just do.

Two: Just is a very inexact word.

One: Kitchen  is  inexact,  what’s  your  point? Two: Leave it off, OK? Mind your own business. One: No, come on, tell me.

...

Example 28.2

On the basis of the eleven lines quoted, we might suggest: they are two friends, they have quite a competitive relationship, they have a rivalry over Gordon, there might later be a tragic incident involving swimming, and the story might be about friendship.

assistant: Examples 28.1 and 28.2 illustrate how the Alphabet-dialogue exercise can be used to generate interesting and engaging dialogue between characters, as well as prompting questions that can help in developing story ideas and understanding character relationships.

From Example 28.1, we can observe a conversation between two characters who seem to have a disagreement over whether everyone can swim or not. This conversation introduces a third character, Gordon, and we can see a sense of curiosity and competitiveness between the two main characters.

From this dialogue, Example 28.2 demonstrates how we can derive several questions and suggestions about the characters and their story:

1. The two main characters are friends.

2. They have a competitive relationship.

3. They both know Gordon, but it's unclear how they are connected to him.

4. There might be a rivalry between the characters involving Gordon.

5. The story could potentially involve a tragic incident related to swimming.

6. The overall theme of the story might be about friendship.

The lesson to be learned from these examples is that the Alphabet-dialogue exercise can serve as a valuable starting point for generating engaging conversations between characters, as well as providing a foundation for developing storylines, character relationships, and themes. This exercise can be particularly helpful in overcoming writer's block and stimulating creativity in the writing process.

Outcome

The ‘limitation’ of the alphabet-task serves a number of functions:

●	As a task-driven exercise, it removes any worries about ‘writing dia- logue’ by requiring the writer to focus on the task.

●	It gives a structure within which the dialogue has to operate. A–Z is, of course, a rudimentary structure; but – as we shall see – a scene in a play is something that leads to a definite outcome. However brief the scene, it will always have its ‘A’ and its ‘Z’ in terms of how it needs to start and when it needs to conclude.

●	It establishes the notion that the writing of dialogue is not about reproducing how people talk ‘in real life’. We may hear things that people do say in ‘real life’ and use them in our writing; but dialogue    in plays is artificially constructed. Writers draw upon modes of con- versational-exchange that exist, but no one speaks in exactly the way as the characters in a play by Oscar Wilde, a monologue by Samuel Beckett, or an episode of Eastenders. The cleverness of all of them – whether you like them or not – is that they ‘sound real’.

assistant: The Alphabet-dialogue exercise helps writers overcome challenges and develop their skills in creating dialogue by focusing on the limitations of the task, establishing a structure, and reinforcing the notion that play dialogue is an artificially constructed representation of real-life conversations.

1. Focus on the task: The Alphabet-dialogue exercise provides a specific task for the writer to concentrate on, which removes the pressure of writing "perfect" dialogue. By focusing on starting each line with a letter from the alphabet, the writer can generate dialogue more freely, without worrying too much about sounding realistic or capturing every nuance of real-life conversation.

Example: In Example 28.1, the writer's focus is on following the alphabet, which leads to an engaging conversation between the two characters without worrying about how "real" the dialogue sounds.

2. Structure: The A-Z limitation provides a rudimentary structure for the dialogue, which can help writers understand the concept of how scenes in plays should start and end. Every scene in a play should have a clear beginning and conclusion, even if it's brief. The Alphabet-dialogue exercise emphasizes this concept by requiring the writer to follow the alphabetical structure.

Example: In Example 28.1, the dialogue starts with "A" and would continue until "Z," giving it a clear structure and emphasizing the importance of having a beginning and an endpoint in a scene.

3. Artificially constructed dialogue: The Alphabet-dialogue exercise reinforces the idea that dialogue in plays is not an exact reproduction of real-life conversations. Although playwrights often draw upon real-life speech patterns, the dialogue in plays is constructed to sound real without precisely replicating natural speech. This exercise helps writers understand that dialogue in plays, such as those by Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, or an episode of Eastenders, is crafted to be engaging and believable, even if it doesn't perfectly mirror how people speak in reality.

Example: In Example 28.1, the conversation may not be precisely how people would speak in real life, but it still sounds engaging and believable as a dialogue in a play.

By understanding these outcomes, writers can use the Alphabet-dialogue exercise as a tool to develop their skills in crafting dialogue for plays and other forms of writing, while also learning the importance of structure and the nature of artificially constructed dialogue.

Exercise 29 Place-association dialogue

Participants: All groups, individual (5–8 minutes)

1	Think of the city, town, etc., where you live.

2	Write down five locations, five colours and five things (animal, vegetable or mineral) you associate with the place. (You could make the list longer by adding other categories: feelings, abstracts, etc.) (See Example 29.1.)

3	Rewrite the list, in alphabetical order (first letters only). (See   Example 29.2.)

4	Write a dialogue in which the words occur in exactly that order. Once again, you do not know who the characters are when you start. See if the associations with the location begin to give a sense of who they might be, or what might be going on. (See Example 29.3.)

assistant: Exercise 29, Place-association dialogue, is designed to help writers practice dialogue creation based on location associations. By focusing on specific elements related to a place, writers can develop a more vivid and engaging conversation between characters. Here's a step-by-step explanation with an example:

1. Think of the city, town, etc., where you live: For this example, let's choose Paris.

2. Write down five locations, five colors, and five things (animal, vegetable, or mineral) you associate with the place:

- Locations: Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Notre-Dame, Montmartre, Seine River

- Colors: Red, Blue, White, Gray, Green

- Things: Baguette, Croissant, Wine, Beret, Bicycle

3. Rewrite the list in alphabetical order (first letters only):

- Baguette, Beret, Bicycle, Blue, Croissant, Eiffel Tower, Green, Gray, Louvre, Montmartre, Notre-Dame, Red, Seine River, White, Wine

4. Write a dialogue in which the words occur in exactly that order:

Character A: "I stopped by the bakery to buy a baguette for lunch."

Character B: "Did you see that man wearing a beret near the bakery?"

Character A: "Yes, he was riding an old bicycle."

Character B: "I noticed the blue paint on it. Quite eye-catching."

Character A: "By the way, I also got a croissant for dessert."

Character B: "Delicious! Let's have a picnic near the Eiffel Tower later."

Character A: "Sounds great. I'll bring a green blanket to sit on."

Character B: "With the gray clouds today, it might rain."

Character A: "Then, let's go to the Louvre instead."

Character B: "Or maybe Montmartre, for a different view of the city."

Character A: "We could also visit Notre-Dame, it's been a while."

Character B: "True. I love the red and blue stained glass windows there."

Character A: "Afterwards, we can take a walk by the Seine River."

Character B: "Perfect. I'll wear my white shirt to look stylish."

Character A: "Don't forget to bring some wine for our picnic!"

Through this exercise, writers can practice incorporating location-specific elements into their dialogue, helping to create a more vivid and engaging conversation. As the dialogue progresses, the associations with the location can give a sense of who the characters might be or what might be happening in the scene.

user: decypher the following dialogues

Example 29.1

Brighton: Pier, Marina, Pavilion, Station, Beach, Green, Turquoise, Grey, White, Cream, Pebbles, Litter, Driftwood, Seagulls, Chewing gum.

Example 29.2

Beach, Cream, Chewing gum, Driftwood, Green, Grey, Litter, Marina, Pier, Pavilion, Pebbles, Station, Seagulls, Turquoise, White.

Example 29.3

A: Do you fancy a walk down the beach? B:	Only if you’ll buy me an ice cream.

A: I paid for the chewing gum, it’s your turn now.

B:	Driftwood! That’s all I am to you. Green stuff, grey stuff, I’m just a bit of litter chucked up by the sea.

A: Who paid for that meal down the Marina? Who paid for the rides on  the Pier?

Etc.

assistant: Example 29.1 is a list of associations related to Brighton: locations, colors, and items commonly found in the area. The list includes the pier, marina, pavilion, station, beach, and various colors and items.

Example 29.2 is a reorganized version of the list from Example 29.1, sorted in alphabetical order by their first letters.

Example 29.3 is a dialogue that incorporates the words from the reorganized list in Example 29.2, in the order they appear:

A: "Do you fancy a walk down the beach?"

B: "Only if you'll buy me an ice cream."

A: "I paid for the chewing gum, it's your turn now."

B: "Driftwood! That's all I am to you. Green stuff, grey stuff, I'm just a bit of litter chucked up by the sea."

A: "Who paid for that meal down the Marina? Who paid for the rides on the Pier?"

Etc.

In this dialogue, the characters are discussing their experiences in Brighton, with one character asking the other to buy them an ice cream while they walk down the beach. The dialogue incorporates the associations from the list (Example 29.2) and helps create a sense of place, as well as the characters' relationship dynamics.

Exercise 30 Filling in the gaps

Participants: All groups, individual (2–3 minutes)

1	Here are three lines of dialogue:

Your mother used to visit this place.

Please don’t break it. Here they come.

2	You have two or three characters.

3	Briefly examine the lines for clues: who, where, what, etc.

4	Write a short exchange of dialogue. The three lines should appear at points in the dialogue, in the order I have given them. (See Example 30.1.)

5	Try these:

I’m so lonely these days.

My bedroom needs painting. I think it was a blue flower.

and

The dog lay on the bed.

You catch the train at teatime. It was inside the paper bag.

assistant: In Exercise 30, the goal is to create a short dialogue using three given lines. By examining the lines for clues about characters, setting, and situation, you can construct a scene that incorporates these lines in the given order. I'll complete the exercise for each set of lines provided.

Example 30.1 (Using the first set of lines)

A: "Your mother used to visit this place."

B: "Really? I never knew that. She never mentioned it to me."

A: "It was her favorite spot to relax and think."

B: "Please don't break it. It's a precious memory of her."

A: "I'll be careful, I promise. We should take a photo here."

C: "Here they come. The rest of the family is joining us."

Example 30.2 (Using the second set of lines)

A: "I'm so lonely these days."

B: "You should try joining a club or taking up a new hobby."

A: "Maybe you're right. I've been thinking about redecorating, actually."

B: "That's a great idea! What do you have in mind?"

A: "My bedroom needs painting. I think it was a blue flower color that I saw in a magazine."

Example 30.3 (Using the third set of lines)

A: "The dog lay on the bed when I left this morning."

B: "You should train him not to do that. He might ruin the sheets."

A: "I know. By the way, don't forget your appointment."

B: "You catch the train at teatime, right?"

A: "Yes, exactly. Oh, and I found the book you were looking for."

B: "Really? Where was it?"

A: "It was inside the paper bag on the kitchen counter."

In each example, the given lines are incorporated into a conversation between two or three characters. The dialogue helps establish the characters' relationships, setting, and situation while using the given lines in the specified order.

user: analyze the following examples. Example 30.1

A: Before she died, your mother used to visit this place. She loved this place.

B:	Dad, you made a promise never to talk about her. Please don’t break it.

A: I can’t help it, every time we come here . . . B:	Here they come, the tears . . .

assistant: In Example 30.1, the dialogue features two characters, A and B, likely a father (A) and their child (B). The conversation revolves around the mother, who has passed away, and a location they are visiting that holds memories of her. The dialogue provides insight into the characters' emotions and relationships.

From the conversation, we can gather that the father finds it challenging to keep his promise not to talk about the mother. The mention of her brings up strong emotions for him, as indicated by the line, "Here they come, the tears."

The child is trying to protect both themselves and their father from the pain of remembering the mother, which is why they remind him of the promise not to talk about her.

This short dialogue offers an emotionally charged scene between a father and a child, dealing with the loss of a loved one and the struggle to move forward. It gives us an idea of their relationship dynamic and the shared grief they are experiencing.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Exercise 31 Word-lists

Participants: All groups, individual (5–6 minutes)

We have already used lists of words as a channel for the imagination. Here they can be used to create a dialogue out of thin air.

1	Use this list of words: blue, fire, television, ice, car, green, love, rain, food, hand, mother, banana, history, song, war, home, red, newspa- per, hope, tree.

2	Write a dialogue for two people. You don’t know who they are or what the situation is. The words should occur in the dialogue in exactly the same order as they appear in the list. ‘Blue’ appears first, ‘fire’ comes next, etc. Once you have used a word, it can appear again at any point in the dialogue.

3	Don’t plan, just launch in with the first line and see where the words lead you.

assistant: In this exercise, you'll be using the provided list of words to create a dialogue between two characters. The goal is to incorporate each word into the dialogue in the same order as they appear in the list without knowing the characters or situation beforehand. Here's an example:

Character A: I bought this blue shirt yesterday, do you like it?

Character B: Yeah, it's nice. I heard there was a fire down the street last night.

Character A: Really? I missed that. I was busy watching television.

Character B: It's getting cold in here, let me grab some ice for our drinks.

Character A: Thanks. By the way, have you seen my car keys?

Character B: No, but I saw a green one on the table.

Character A: Love this weather, don't you?

Character B: I prefer the rain, actually.

Character A: Oh, I should start making some food soon.

Character B: Can you give me a hand with this box?

Character A: Sure. My mother always said to help others.

Character B: Speaking of which, I found a great banana bread recipe from her.

Character A: Ah, that brings back memories. You know, she was a history buff.

Character B: I remember her singing that old war song all the time.

Character A: Yeah, she loved it. War stories were always close to home for her.

Character B: I read about that in the newspaper once.

Character A: Despite everything, she always held on to hope.

Character B: Just like that tree in our backyard, standing strong through the years.

In this example, the dialogue unfolds organically while incorporating each word from the list in the given order. The conversation offers glimpses into the characters' lives, their relationships, and their memories, creating a natural and engaging dialogue.

user: analyze this and learn lessons.

Example 31.1

One:	I saw a sheep that had blue dye on it.

Two:	Yeah, maybe it got burnt in a fire with blue flames.

One:	It could have rubbed up against a television when that blue movie was on.

Two:	Or someone could’ve spilt some of that blue ice drink on it.

One:	I spray painted my car blue, then I got some on my leg – does that make me a sheep?

Two:	Your car is green.

One:	You’re avoiding the question. I love it when you do that. Tell me if you think I’m a sheep.

Two:	Well, stand out in the rain and if your skin shrinks, then maybe you are a sheep. And if you are a sheep I’ll give you a hand to find some grass.

...

assistant: In Example 31.1, the dialogue unfolds by incorporating the given list of words in order. Although the conversation revolves around a somewhat unusual and playful topic - whether one character is a sheep - it demonstrates the following lessons:

1. Creativity: The dialogue shows how the given words can be used to create a unique and imaginative conversation. By using the words as prompts, the characters engage in a playful banter, which adds an interesting and entertaining dynamic to their exchange.

2. Flexibility: The example illustrates the importance of being flexible and open to unexpected directions in a dialogue. The characters are responding to each other's comments and ideas, allowing the conversation to flow naturally while still incorporating the given words.

3. Character development: Even in a short and seemingly random dialogue, we can glean information about the characters' personalities and their relationship with each other. One character is playful and imaginative, while the other is more grounded and practical. Their interaction demonstrates their ability to find humor in the situation and engage with each other on a deeper level.

4. Use of context: The dialogue uses the given words in a variety of contexts, highlighting the multiple ways that the same word can be used in different conversations. This demonstrates the versatility of language and the importance of considering context when crafting dialogue.

In summary, this example showcases the importance of creativity, flexibility, character development, and context in crafting engaging and unique dialogue, even when using a predetermined list of words as prompts.

Exercise 32 One-to-ten dialogue

Participants: All groups, individual (2–3 minutes)

1	You have two people. You don’t know who they are.

2	There will be ten lines of dialogue. You don’t know what they will be.

3	The first line will have ten words, the second nine words and so on, up to the tenth line, which will have one word.

Example 32.1

A: Have you got any bananas for sale today, mister Smith? (10)  B: Sorry, I don’t have bananas, but I’ve got apples. (9)

A: Those apples you sold last week were rotten. (8)  B: So are you calling me a cheat? (7)

assistant: Exercise 32, the One-to-ten dialogue, is a writing exercise that focuses on creating a conversation between two characters with a descending number of words in each line, from ten to one. By using this structure, the exercise encourages creativity, brevity, and conciseness in dialogue writing.

Let's analyze the given example, Example 32.1:

A: Have you got any bananas for sale today, mister Smith? (10)

B: Sorry, I don’t have bananas, but I’ve got apples. (9)

A: Those apples you sold last week were rotten. (8)

B: So are you calling me a cheat? (7)

The dialogue in Example 32.1 starts with a question about the availability of bananas for sale. The conversation then shifts to apples and their quality, leading to a potential conflict between the characters. Although the dialogue is brief and the lines are short, it still provides insight into the characters and their relationship.

Some lessons we can learn from this exercise and example include:

1. Brevity: The exercise demonstrates the importance of using concise and precise language in dialogue, as each line has a decreasing number of words. This forces the writer to get to the point quickly and effectively.

2. Conflict: Even in a short exchange, conflict can arise, as seen in the example when one character accuses the other of selling rotten apples. Conflict is an essential element in storytelling, and incorporating it into dialogue can create more engaging and dynamic interactions between characters.

3. Characterization: Despite the brevity of the dialogue, we can still infer certain traits about the characters. For example, Character A seems concerned about the quality of the products they buy, while Character B may be defensive about their reputation.

4. Creativity: The exercise encourages creativity by requiring the writer to craft dialogue within a specific structure, making it challenging to convey information and emotions effectively while adhering to the word count limitations.

In summary, Exercise 32 helps writers develop their skills in crafting concise, engaging dialogue while exploring conflict, characterization, and creativity within the constraints of the one-to-ten word structure.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. Outcome

With the above exercises, we have established a principle that is at the heart of the development of all stories: even the most basic text contains within it the potential seeds for further development. When working with writers on their plays, I have found that the best way of moving forward is to address the clues that the text already provides. We all have a ten- dency to push aside an early thought or idea; to dismiss it as not very interesting. But an idea becomes interesting only if it is worked on, so it

is important is to keep digging away, right up to the point where we absolutely know it must be discarded. And even then, there might still be something that is useful. What we must do is to place value on the fact that anything we commit to the written word has value and potential.

assistant: The outcome of the exercises discussed in the previous examples highlights the importance of recognizing the potential for story development within even the most basic text. When writers work on their plays, they should focus on the clues their text provides, as these can be the seeds for further growth and development of the story.

For example, let's consider a simple dialogue:

A: I can't find my keys.

B: Have you checked the living room?

While this dialogue might seem basic and uninteresting at first glance, it contains seeds for further development. We can expand on the situation, relationships between characters, and emotions involved:

A: I can't find my keys, and I'm late for an important meeting.

B: Have you checked the living room? You were watching TV there last night.

By adding more context, we can now see that the character A is stressed about being late for a meeting, and character B tries to help by offering suggestions based on their knowledge of character A's actions the night before.

Writers should value every idea and piece of text they create, as even seemingly insignificant details can be developed into something more interesting and engaging. It's essential to keep exploring and working on ideas until it becomes clear that they cannot be developed further or can be repurposed for another part of the story.

In summary, the outcome of these exercises teaches writers to:

1. Recognize the potential for story development in even the most basic text.

2. Focus on the clues and ideas their text provides to expand on the story, character relationships, and emotions.

3. Place value on every idea and piece of text, as they can be developed or repurposed to enhance the story.

4. Keep exploring and working on ideas until it becomes clear that they must be discarded or used elsewhere in the story.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

PLOT

Although we have just dipped into work on dialogue, this often comes last in the making of a play. Character, situation and story generally come before full dialogue is developed. This applies to someone writing a full- length play, a group devising a sketch, or a pupil taking part in a half-hour writing session in primary school. Get the story-idea, explore what- happens-to-who, then show it through what is spoken. If you did the ‘bank manager questions’ in Exercise 26, you have already begun to explore this area.

We will be looking in detail at different aspects of the word ‘story’ later on; for the moment, let’s focus a little more on the ‘what-happens-next’ aspect – or ‘plot’.

Plot: the pattern of events and situations in a narrative or dramatic work, as selected and arranged both to emphasise relationship – usually of cause and effect – between incidents and to elicit a particular kind of interest in the reader or audience, such as surprise or suspense.

(Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms)

The very word itself tells us everything: we ‘plot revenge’, we ‘plot the points on the map’. If ‘story’ is the total picture, plot is about the detail- moments of the story: the ‘plot-points’ as they are called.

assistant: Plot is a crucial element of storytelling that focuses on the sequence of events and situations in a narrative or dramatic work. It is the detailed structure of the story, highlighting the relationships between incidents, often following a cause-and-effect pattern. The primary purpose of the plot is to elicit specific reactions from the reader or audience, such as surprise, suspense, or emotional engagement.

For example, consider the famous play "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare. The overall story is about the tragic love between two young people from feuding families. The plot, however, consists of a series of events and situations that emphasize the cause-and-effect relationships between the incidents, leading to the climactic and tragic conclusion.

Some key plot points in "Romeo and Juliet" include:

1. Romeo and Juliet meet at a party and fall in love.

2. Romeo and Juliet secretly marry, despite the feud between their families.

3. Romeo kills Tybalt (Juliet's cousin) in a fight, leading to his banishment.

4. Juliet's family arranges for her to marry Paris, unaware of her secret marriage to Romeo.

5. Juliet fakes her death to avoid marrying Paris and to reunite with Romeo.

6. Romeo, unaware of Juliet's plan, believes she is dead and kills himself.

7. Juliet wakes up, finds Romeo dead, and kills herself.

These plot points demonstrate the cause-and-effect relationships between events, leading to the tragic ending. The plot builds suspense, creates conflict, and engages the audience in the characters' lives.

In summary, while the story provides the overall picture, the plot consists of specific events and situations that emphasize the relationships between incidents in the narrative. It is essential to focus on the plot to create a compelling and engaging story, as it is the driving force behind the characters' actions and the audience's emotional investment in the narrative.

Exercise 33 Journey: door-to-door

Participants: All groups, individual (10–15 minutes)

1	If you are working away from home, think of the journey you made between your own front door and the door of the building you are in.   If you are working at home, go for a walk and come back.

2	Write down, in order, about ten things that you saw, heard or did along the way. Think of the journey as a washing line, with the ten things pegged out along it. In the story of your journey, these are your ‘plot-points’. (See Example 33.1.)

3	It is quite likely that your journey was, like mine, quite uneventful and routine. So look along the washing-line and find somewhere to insert one thing that didn’t happen. As with the exercise on ‘character’ earlier, keep it within the bounds of what you have set up. (See Example 33.2.)

4	Consider what possibilities are offered by the event that didn’t hap- pen: something unusual, mysterious, alarming, thought-provoking.

5	Bring another person, related to the new event, into the story at this point. Make it something that is believable within the world you have described – avoid getting carried away by men from Mars, gruesome murders or encounters with film stars.

6	Rewrite the final part of the story from the new event. Allow it to go where it needs to; but you will always end by entering the door you are travelling towards. (See Example 33.3.)

7	Write a list of questions you would like the story so far to answer.

8	Write a list of things that might happen next.

9	Write a short dialogue for two of the characters.

assistant: I'll walk through the exercise and provide an example at each step.

1. I took a walk around the neighborhood and returned home.

2. Ten things I saw, heard, or did along the way:

1. Closed the front door

2. Passed a red car

3. Heard a dog barking

4. Noticed a couple arguing

5. Saw a cat chasing a squirrel

6. Crossed the street

7. Smelled fresh bread from the bakery

8. Waved to a neighbor

9. Stepped over a puddle

10. Opened the door and returned home

3. Inserting an event that didn't happen: "Found a mysterious envelope on the ground."

4. The mysterious envelope offers possibilities for intrigue, suspense, and curiosity.

5. I'll introduce a new character: the person who dropped the envelope.

6. Rewriting the final part of the story with the new event:

1. Closed the front door

2. Passed a red car

3. Heard a dog barking

4. Noticed a couple arguing

5. Found a mysterious envelope on the ground

6. Met the person who dropped the envelope

7. Exchanged words with the person

8. Decided to help the person

9. Worked together to solve the mystery

10. Opened the door and returned home

7. Questions the story might answer:

- What was inside the envelope?

- Who dropped the envelope, and why?

- What is the mystery that needs to be solved?

8. Things that might happen next:

- Investigate the contents of the envelope

- Visit different locations to gather clues

- Meet other characters who are involved in the mystery

9. A short dialogue between the two characters:

A: "I can't believe I dropped that envelope. It's crucial to my research."

B: "Don't worry, I found it and want to help you. What's this all about?"

Summary of lessons behind this exercise:

- The exercise shows that even routine events can be the basis for an engaging story.

- Introducing an unexpected event can add intrigue and create new narrative possibilities.

- Incorporating believable characters and dialogue can help develop the story further.

- Questions and potential next steps can guide the direction of the story and maintain interest.

user: analyze the answers and campare them with your answers, find the lessons behind please.

Example 33.1

Here is what happened to me this morning:

●	I left my house to go to the shops.

●	I looked at the sea.

●	I walked past the park and looked at the autumn trees.

●	It started to rain, so I sheltered in the porch of a block of flats.

●	I decided to roll a cigarette but the papers were wet.

●	I was beginning to wish I’d never come out.

●	The rain was blowing into the porch so I carried on walking.

●	A car drove into a puddle and splashed me.

●	The sun came out suddenly.

●	At the shop I bought some yoghurt and bread.

●	I decided to buy a bar of chocolate to cheer myself up.

●	I arrived back at my home.

Example 33.2

Everything stays the same until it starts to rain:

●	It started to rain, so I sheltered in the porch of a block of flats.

●	There was a brand new umbrella propped up by the door.

●	I was about to take it when someone came out of the flats.

Example 33.3

●	There was a brand new umbrella propped up by the door.

●	I was about to take it when a man came out of the flats.

●	The man accused me of being a thief and walked away with the umbrella.

●	An elderly woman came out of the flats, looking for her umbrella.

●	I explained that someone had taken it.

●	She became very upset.

●	She explained that there was a man in the flats harassing her and steal- ing her things.

●	I gave her my phone number. I said I would phone the police on her behalf.

●	She went back inside.

●	I tried to roll a cigarette, but the papers were wet.

●	Etc.

assistant: Analyzing the provided examples and comparing them to my own answers:

Example 33.1 is a simple, routine journey with a series of events that happened along the way. The writer observes their surroundings, encounters some challenges (rain, wet cigarette papers), and makes a decision (buying chocolate to cheer up) before arriving back home.

Example 33.2 introduces an unexpected event: finding a brand new umbrella propped up by the door. This adds an element of intrigue to the story and sets up the possibility for further developments.

Example 33.3 expands the story with the introduction of new characters, an accusation of theft, and the revelation of the elderly woman's situation with a harasser. The protagonist decides to help the woman, adding a new layer of complexity to the journey.

Comparing these examples to my own answers, the key differences are in the details of the journey and the unexpected events introduced. In my answer, the unexpected event was finding a mysterious envelope, while in the example, it was discovering the umbrella. Both unexpected events lead to the introduction of new characters and situations, demonstrating how a simple journey can evolve into a more complex story with elements of intrigue, suspense, and empathy.

The lessons behind these examples are:

- Even ordinary events and experiences can be a foundation for a compelling story.

- Introducing an unexpected event can create intrigue and open up new narrative possibilities.

- By adding new characters and situations, the story becomes more engaging and relatable to readers.

- The protagonist's decisions and actions in response to these unexpected events can drive the story forward and reveal their character traits.

user: do the exercise first

Exercise 34 Plot and dialogue

Participants: All groups (15–20 minutes)

1	Divide up into small groups of four or five.

2	Each group is a ‘family’.

3	Decide which member of the family each person is.

4	The ‘family’ is doing something ordinary together. You could choose something domestic (at home watching the TV), but think of all the

other possibilities: having a picnic in the park, watching a carnival parade, etc.

5	You are going to create a progression of frozen ‘plot-moments’ that will show a story. These will take the form of still images – rather like a sequence of snapshots. The story is about how a conflict arises and is finally resolved. Avoid getting into physical conflict and focus on what is happening psychologically.

6	The sequence is as follows:

●	The family is engaged in its activity.

●	There is a minor upset – a misunderstanding or a disagreement.

●	There is a conflict into which everyone is drawn.

●	Attempts are made to resolve the conflict.

●	The conflict is finally resolved. (See Example 34.1.)

7	Share the results with the whole group.

8	Replay one of the sequences. This time, as each frozen moment is shown, imagine there is a blank ‘speech-bubble’ above each of the character’s heads.

9	The audience now suggests what is in the speech-bubbles. (See Example 34.2.)

10	Repeat this process for all the sequences.

11	Each ‘family’ group will now write out the script. Use the suggestions from the ‘speech-bubble’ exercise, but allow the story to develop. Fill in the gaps between the main plot-events.

assistant: For this exercise, I will imagine a family of four members: a father, a mother, a teenage son, and a young daughter. They are all sitting together, playing a board game.

1. The family is engaged in its activity: All four family members are sitting around a table, focused on the board game, laughing and enjoying their time together.

2. There is a minor upset – a misunderstanding or a disagreement: The teenage son accuses the young daughter of cheating, leading to an argument between the two.

3. There is a conflict into which everyone is drawn: The father tries to intervene, taking the daughter's side, which makes the teenage son even more upset. The mother tries to calm everyone down, but the situation escalates.

4. Attempts are made to resolve the conflict: The mother suggests taking a break from the game to cool down, but the tension remains high between the teenage son and the father.

5. The conflict is finally resolved: The father apologizes to the teenage son for not listening to his side of the story, and the son apologizes for accusing his sister. They all agree to continue the game with a fresh start, focusing on having fun together.

Example 34.2 - Speech-bubbles for each frozen moment:

1. Father: "This game is so much fun!"

Mother: "I love spending time with the family."

Teenage Son: "I'm winning!"

Young Daughter: "I can still catch up!"

2. Teenage Son: "You cheated!"

Young Daughter: "No, I didn't!"

3. Father: "Calm down, son. It's just a game."

Mother: "Let's not fight, everyone."

Teenage Son: "You always take her side!"

Young Daughter: "I didn't do anything wrong!"

4. Mother: "Why don't we take a break and cool off?"

Father: "Maybe we should."

Teenage Son: "Fine."

Young Daughter: "I don't want to fight."

5. Father: "I'm sorry, son. I should have listened to you."

Teenage Son: "I'm sorry too, Dad. Let's just have fun."

Mother: "That's the spirit!"

Young Daughter: "Can we continue the game now?"

From these frozen moments and speech-bubbles, the family can now create a script, expanding the dialogue and filling in the gaps between the main plot events to create a complete and engaging story.

user: compare your answers with the following standard answers, pls tell the differences and commons, find the lessons behind.

Example 34.1

●	The family is having a picnic on the beach.

●	The grandfather won’t let the little daughter go into the sea.

●	Everyone takes sides.

●	The father suggests they all go for a paddle.

●	They all take off their shoes, walk down to the sea and paddle.

Example 34.2

Frozen image 1: The family is having a picnic on the beach.

Daughter:	When we’ve finished eating, are we going to go in the water?

Mother:	I was reading in the paper that it’s not very clean. Son:	Can I have another banana?

Father:	You’ve had two already, that last one’s for your sister. Grandfather: Ah, this is the life.

Etc.

Frozen image 2: The grandfather won’t let the little daughter into the sea. Daughter:	I’m going to go in the sea.

Father:	Eat your banana first.

Grandfather: You stay here, my girl, you’re not going in that filthy muck. Son:	Yes, it’s filthy muck.

Mother:	Yes, it did say in the paper . . .

Etc.

assistant: Comparing the standard answers with my answers, we can observe some differences and commonalities, as well as lessons to learn from them.

Differences:

1. The setting: The standard answer involves a family having a picnic on the beach, while my answer has a family playing a board game at home.

2. The conflict: In the standard answer, the conflict is about the little daughter not being allowed to go into the sea, while in my answer, it's about the teenage son accusing the young daughter of cheating in the game.

3. The resolution: The standard answer's resolution involves everyone going for a paddle, while my answer's resolution comes from apologies and agreeing to continue the game with a fresh start.

Commonalities:

1. Both scenarios involve a family spending time together.

2. A conflict arises, which leads to a disagreement among the family members.

3. Attempts are made to resolve the conflict in both scenarios.

4. The conflicts are ultimately resolved, and the family continues with their activity.

Lessons:

1. The exercise demonstrates that a wide range of settings and conflicts can lead to engaging stories.

2. Conflict resolution is an essential part of storytelling and can take many forms depending on the characters and the situation.

3. Dialogue is crucial in driving the story forward and highlighting the characters' emotions and perspectives.

4. Despite the differences in specific details, the exercise shows that a basic structure of a story can be applied to various scenarios to create an engaging narrative.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

We have now seen how dialogue supports a succession of plot-events. If we know the shape of the story, and where the main dramatic moments are, the dialogue will begin to naturally fill out that shape.

assistant: Outcome refers to the result or understanding gained after completing an exercise or activity. In this case, the outcome demonstrates the relationship between dialogue and plot-events in a story. The idea is that when you have a clear understanding of the story's structure and the key dramatic moments, the dialogue will naturally develop and help build the narrative.

To explain this in detail, let's consider an example:

Imagine a story about two friends who have a disagreement about a business decision. The story's structure could be as follows:

1. The friends discuss a business opportunity.

2. They disagree on how to proceed.

3. The disagreement escalates and causes tension.

4. They each present their reasons for their positions.

5. A resolution is reached, and the friendship is restored.

With this structure in place, the dialogue can naturally fill in the gaps, providing context, revealing character motivations, and adding depth to the story.

Example:

1. Friend A: "Hey, I found this great investment opportunity. We could potentially make a lot of money."

Friend B: "Really? Tell me more about it."

2. Friend A: "Well, it's a bit risky, but I think we should go for it."

Friend B: "I'm not so sure. We should be more cautious with our investments."

3. Friend A: "Come on, we can't just play it safe all the time!"

Friend B: "And we can't just throw our money away on every risky venture!"

4. Friend A: "This isn't just any venture; it's a well-researched opportunity. We can't miss out on this."

Friend B: "But we have other commitments, and we can't afford to lose money on this."

5. Friend A: "You're right. We should consider our other responsibilities too. Let's find a compromise."

Friend B: "Agreed. Let's do some more research and make a well-informed decision together."

In this example, the dialogue supports the progression of the plot-events, making the story more engaging and complete. As a result, the dialogue helps to fill out the story's shape, providing a more cohesive and compelling narrative.

user: Now you are a great director and playwright, please explain this to me with good examples from the classics such as shakespeare's works.

THEME

If plot is about the details of ‘what happens’, then theme is about ‘about’.

Theme: a salient abstract idea that emerges from a literary work’s treatment of its subject matter. While the subject of a work  is  described concretely in terms of its action (e.g. ‘the adventures of a newcomer in the big city’), its theme or themes will be described in more abstract terms (e.g. love, war, revenge, betrayal, fate, etc.). The theme of a work may be announced explicitly, but more often it emerges indirectly through the recurrence of motifs.

(Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms)

The theme of Macbeth could be: ‘the journey of a man from honour to dishonour.’ The theme of Little Red Riding Hood could be: ‘the journey  of a child from the safety of home to the dangers of the wide world.’

assistant: Theme is a crucial aspect of any literary work, as it represents the central idea or underlying message that the author wants to convey. Themes are often explored through recurring motifs, symbols, or situations in the work.

Let's consider two examples from Shakespeare's plays to understand the concept of theme better:

1. Hamlet: One of the central themes in Hamlet is revenge. The story revolves around the titular character, Prince Hamlet, who seeks to avenge his father's murder. Throughout the play, the theme of revenge is explored in various ways, such as through the actions of Hamlet, the ghost of his father, and other characters like Laertes and Fortinbras. The theme of revenge in Hamlet is closely tied to other themes such as betrayal, corruption, and the nature of life and death.

2. Romeo and Juliet: In this classic tragedy, the theme of love is central to the story. The play tells the tale of two young lovers, Romeo and Juliet, who come from feuding families. Their love defies the animosity between their families and leads to tragic consequences. The theme of love in Romeo and Juliet is explored in various forms, including romantic love, familial love, and the concept of love at first sight. Other themes in the play include fate, conflict, and the consequences of hasty decisions.

In both of these examples, Shakespeare uses the themes of revenge and love to provide deeper meaning and context to the stories. The themes are not only integral to the plots but also help readers and audiences understand the broader implications of the characters' actions and choices. By exploring these themes, Shakespeare delves into universal human experiences and emotions, making his works timeless and relevant even today.

Exercise 35 Theme from lists: monologues

Participants: All groups, individual (10–15 minutes)

1	Write out a list of 20–25 words, under the following categories:

●	Eleven ‘things’ (animal, vegetable, mineral; natural or human- made; no people).

●	Six colours.

●	Five feelings or emotions. (See Example 35.1.)

2	Now re-write the list, mixing the categories up by placing the words in alphabetical order (taking only the first letter of the word as the guide, that is, all the A-words, then all the B-words, etc.). (See Example 35.2.)

3	Write a speech on a particular theme or something that is quite important, such as ‘war ’. There are two rules: your particular theme cannot be mentioned by name, and the words in the list must all appear absolutely in that order. The first one to appear must be ‘ant’, the last one ‘zoo’. (See Example 35.3.)

4	Once again, the advice is not to plan; just launch in and allow the words to lead you. These key words are the spine, and the other words you use are the bridges between them. Do not worry if it doesn’t seem to be making ‘logical sense’ – indeed, if it seems completely illogical and off-the-wall and if it makes you laugh, then so much the better.

5	Try using the same list of words to explore other themes: education, AIDS, loyalty, guilt, trust, etc. Never mention the word in your writing; allow the word to help you find your images and expressions.

6	After using the same list for all the above exercises, reflect on how the imposition of different themes stimulate the creation of fresh, new imagery.

assistant: Example 35.1:

●	Things: Ant, bicycle, cloud, doll, envelope, fountain, guitar, hat, ice cream, jade, kite

●	Colors: Aqua, blue, crimson, gold, orange, violet

●	Feelings/Emotions: Admiration, boredom, curiosity, determination, envy

Example 35.2:

Admiration, ant, aqua, bicycle, blue, boredom, cloud, crimson, curiosity, determination, doll, envelope, envy, fountain, gold, guitar, hat, ice cream, jade, kite, orange, violet

Example 35.3:

Li Mei, full of admiration, carefully observed the tiny ant as it carried a load far greater than its own size. Aqua ripples formed on the water's surface, where the reflection of her bicycle lay. The blue sky above her seemed infinite, while a sudden wave of boredom washed over her.

In the distance, she saw clouds gathering, their crimson hues painting the horizon. Curiosity piqued, Li Mei felt a surge of determination to chase the setting sun. The doll she used to play with sat forgotten on the park bench, next to a crumpled envelope.

Feelings of envy emerged as she watched a couple near the fountain, their laughter contagious. The gold hue of the sunset bathed the scene in a warm glow. She picked up her guitar and strummed a melody that floated through the air like a gentle breeze.

Placing her hat on her head, Li Mei decided it was time to continue her journey. She bought an ice cream, the cold sweetness invigorating her senses. She admired a jade pendant in a store window, wondering if it held any secret powers.

With a smile, she launched her kite into the sky, its orange tail fluttering wildly. As she watched it soar, she thought of her own dreams and ambitions, feeling the power of determination within her. The violet hues of twilight signaled the end of the day, and Li Mei knew that no matter the challenges she faced, her unyielding spirit would lead her to success, just like the ant that never gave up.

user: rewrite the following example to li mei's story. you should think about the character of li mei and make adaption if necessary. please.

I gave a writer the list we have above and asked her to write a short story on the theme of ‘war’. So what do an ant, an answerphone and a bluebell have to do with war? She came up with this opening: ‘The ant crawled across the mud towards the body. In the dead man’s hand was an answer- phone. By his foot was a crushed bluebell . . .’.

A beautiful example of creating a fresh new image of war, through three words which did not seem to belong together at all.

assistant: Example 35.1 (adapted for Li Mei's story):

Panda, Ant, West Lake, Moon, Bench, Cat, Willow, Smartphone, Lotus, Tea House, Mat, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Pink, Black, Envy, Joy, Love, Hate, Serenity

Ant, Bench, Black, Blue, Cat, Envy, Green, Hate, Joy, Lotus, Love, Mat, Moon, Panda, Pink, Red, Serenity, Smartphone, Tea House, West Lake, Willow, Yellow, Zoo

Example 35.3 (adapted for Li Mei's story):

Li Mei watched the ant crawl along the stone path, leading her towards the West Lake. The serenity of the water, with its reflection of the moon, captivated her. She sat down on a nearby bench, observing a cat playing among the willow trees.

A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, and Li Mei's smartphone vibrated with a message. She looked at the lotus flowers floating peacefully on the water's surface, ignoring the distractions of the digital world.

As she strolled towards the tea house, a mat of vibrant reds, greens, and blues caught her eye. The colors reminded her of the joy she experienced exploring her city. She felt a mixture of love and envy for the beauty of Hangzhou.

Unexpectedly, Li Mei spotted a panda in a small zoo enclosure, its black and white fur contrasting with the lush greenery. She couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for the confined animal.

The warm yellow glow of the tea house welcomed her as she entered, and her thoughts turned away from the encaged panda. She embraced the serenity of her surroundings, savoring the rich tapestry of life in Hangzhou.

Exercise 36 Theme from lists: dialogues

Participants: All groups, individual (3–4 minutes each)

Using the same list of words, write a dialogue for two people, around the following themes: betrayal, revenge, bullying, death. Once again, the theme should not be mentioned by name, and the words should occur in the dialogue in the same order as in the list. Keep in mind the fact that although there is one theme (never mentioned by name), the characters may display very different attitudes towards it.

assistant: In this exercise, we'll use the adapted list of words from Example 35.2 to create a dialogue between two characters in Li Mei's story, revolving around the theme of betrayal. Remember that the theme should not be mentioned explicitly, and the words from the list should appear in the dialogue in the same order.

Adapted list of words: Ant, Bench, Black, Blue, Cat, Envy, Green, Hate, Joy, Lotus, Love, Mat, Serenity, Smartphone, Tea House, West Lake, Willow, Yellow, Zoo

Character 1: Li Mei

Character 2: Li Mei's best friend, Xiao Yu

---

Li Mei: Look at that tiny ant, it's carrying something much bigger than itself.

Xiao Yu: Yeah, amazing! Let's sit on this bench and enjoy the view of West Lake for a while.

Li Mei: The water looks so deep and black today. I wonder why.

Xiao Yu: Probably because of the storm last night. The sky is still a bit blue, though.

Li Mei: True. I saw a cat earlier, playing near the willows. It looked so carefree.

Xiao Yu: Sometimes I envy animals. They don't have to worry about complicated things like us.

Li Mei: The green leaves on the trees make everything look so fresh and alive.

Xiao Yu: But sometimes, life can be filled with hate and pain, especially when people let you down.

Li Mei: I understand. We should focus on the joy in life, like appreciating the beauty of a lotus flower.

Xiao Yu: I guess love can help heal wounds, even if it takes time.

Li Mei: Speaking of love, I saw a couple having a picnic on that red mat over there. They looked so happy.

Xiao Yu: Happiness and serenity are the keys to a fulfilling life, aren't they?

Li Mei: Yes, they are. Oh, my smartphone is ringing. It's my mom. She's asking when we'll be back.

Xiao Yu: We should probably head back soon. Maybe stop by the tea house for a quick drink?

Li Mei: Good idea! West Lake is always so beautiful, no matter how many times we visit.

Xiao Yu: The willow trees seem to whisper secrets in the wind, don't they?

Li Mei: They do! And the yellow sunflowers along the path always make me smile.

Xiao Yu: Just like that panda in the zoo, sometimes we have to find our happiness in small things.

---

In this dialogue, the theme of betrayal is not explicitly mentioned, but it is subtly implied through the characters' discussion about the complexities of life, hate, and pain. The dialogue also incorporates the words from the adapted list in the correct order.

user: wow, wonderful amazing work.

Now please Please explain this in details with at least one example of the story of Li Mei

Outcome

What these exercises show is that a theme can be ‘talked around’, often in illuminating and poetic ways, in a manner quite different from an aca- demic essay on a subject. Once again, the ‘limitation’ of a list becomes the stimulation to a creative angle on the topic in hand.

assistant: The exercises involving Li Mei's story demonstrate that by focusing on a theme without directly naming it, we can explore it through different perspectives and in a more poetic or creative way. This approach differs significantly from writing an academic essay or a straightforward narrative, as it allows for the emergence of deeper and more nuanced expressions of the theme.

For example, in the dialogue exercise where we explored the theme of betrayal, we didn't explicitly mention betrayal. Instead, the characters discussed the complexities of life, emotions such as hate and pain, and the importance of focusing on joy and love. By talking around the theme, the dialogue created an atmosphere where the reader can sense the underlying feelings and emotions related to betrayal without stating it directly. This indirect approach can be more engaging for readers and allows them to draw their own conclusions.

Another outcome of these exercises is the demonstration of how a list of seemingly unrelated words can stimulate creativity and provide a fresh perspective on a theme. By incorporating the words from the list into the dialogue or monologue, the writer is encouraged to find connections between these words and the theme, leading to unique and unexpected images or situations. This approach pushes the writer to explore new angles and perspectives on the theme, resulting in a more engaging and original narrative.

In the case of Li Mei's story, using the list of words helped create vivid imagery of the West Lake setting and the characters' emotions, adding depth to the theme of betrayal. The inclusion of words like "ant," "willow," and "tea house" painted a rich picture of the surroundings while also allowing the characters to discuss their feelings in a subtle and poetic manner. This outcome highlights the power of using limitations as a source of inspiration and creativity when writing about a theme.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example of the story of Li Mei

LOCATION

The location of the story – where it takes place – crucial to the telling of    the tale. As we shall see later on, the location is much more than the back- drop to the narrative, and the seed of a story can be found in where it is set.

assistant: Location plays a vital role in storytelling, as it not only provides a backdrop for the narrative but also can significantly influence the plot, characters, and themes. The setting of a story can evoke specific emotions, create a unique atmosphere, and even serve as a source of inspiration for the story itself. In the case of Li Mei's story, the location of Hangzhou, China, and specifically the West Lake, is integral to the overall narrative.

Hangzhou, with its rich cultural history and breathtaking scenery, sets the stage for Li Mei's journey of self-discovery and growth. The West Lake, known for its natural beauty and historic sites, serves as a symbol of the story's themes, such as love, betrayal, and the search for identity. The peaceful and picturesque surroundings create a stark contrast to the emotional turmoil Li Mei experiences throughout the story.

One example from Li Mei's story where location plays a crucial role is when Li Mei encounters the willow tree by the West Lake. This serene and beautiful setting becomes the backdrop for Li Mei's emotional struggle as she grapples with her feelings of betrayal and the burden of her secret. The willow tree, with its graceful branches swaying in the wind, symbolizes Li Mei's emotional state: seemingly calm and composed on the surface, but with a deep undercurrent of sadness and longing.

Another example is the tea house where Li Mei meets her friend and confidante. The tea house, with its traditional architecture and calming ambiance, reflects the cultural heritage of Hangzhou and serves as a safe space for Li Mei to open up about her feelings. The location further emphasizes the contrast between the tranquil surroundings and Li Mei's inner turmoil, as she seeks solace and advice within the tea house's comforting walls.

In Li Mei's story, the location of Hangzhou and the West Lake not only provides a visually stunning setting for the narrative but also acts as a catalyst for the unfolding events and the exploration of the story's themes. The location influences the characters' actions and emotions, allowing for a richer and more layered storytelling experience.

user: do the exercises in the context of Li Mei's story please.

Exercise 37 The object and the place

user: learn the following and apply to the story of Li Mei, write an example please.

LANGUAGE AND IMAGERY

I asked a friend of mine, who is an actor, what he looks for when he is handed a new play to read. Firstly, he said, he would look for a conscious- ness of the poetic and a feeling of command in the use of the language; real value being given to the words and how they were used, how the sentences held together. After that, if there were good, dramatic characters or an interesting story.  But he was adamant that the use of language came first:  ‘if you have dull sentence-work and lifeless imagery, then all you have is character and story.’  This should be of great interest to us, as writers, for  we are creating work for strangers to read, recite or  speak.  What  right have we to offer it to them if it does not give them an experience of language newly made?

I had been working with a group of people in London, all new to writ-   ing for live performance. One of them was a  young  man  from  Albania, who had found his way to the sessions in the hope that they would help   him with his English. At first, when he produced work, he apologised for    the fact that it was not ‘correct English’, but such was the power of how he used the language that I – and the rest of the group – said that he had noth- ing to apologise for.  Yes,  we said, he did need to learn the correct forms,  the grammar, etc. (and we helped him with such things); but he must not lose the instinctive, poetic use of the language he had now. By the end of  the project, the group had all contributed to a script, based upon their individual writings. Here is an excerpt from his part of the script:

My life was in my way. This love was inside me. Suddenly it fell out of my soul. I felt empty, cold and sadness. Huge icy building of loneliness built up surround me. They pour out hate and anger. In a sphere, squashed in two poles, who keep the known space in the limitless uni- verse, the shout of a black cat, germinates the deadly spirits, black matu- rity of hunger. They are thirsty and they are hungry, I am covered with salt tears. They overload up in my eyelashes and break them. Something is slaughtering inside me. My soul is bowling. O God please help her, us, me to dissolve this disgrace. Here, here, thirsty spirits, here drink my blood, inject the poison into my veins, let it be the last thirst. Here, here, eat my lungs, rip my chest, let it be the last hunger.

I showed this to my friend the actor. ‘Exactly’, he said.

Writing is a craft – and the craft of writing in play-form is particularly exacting. In this opening chapter we have begun to research some of the basic aspects of the craft. In the following chapters we will dig deeper. Knowledge and understanding of structure, character-development, plot, etc. are basic (whether we are making a five-minute sketch or a three-act tragedy), but what is crucial is what the young man from Albania showed  us: the courage and the determination to forge new meanings from the language we are working with.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create a passage that showcases the poetic use of language and imagery:

Li Mei: The city's heartbeat pulses beneath my feet, and I am a part of its rhythm, a thread in its ever-changing tapestry. Hangzhou, like the unfurling lotus, reveals its beauty in layers, as the seasons paint its landscapes anew. Fashion is my language, my medium to capture this city's essence and grace, to weave my dreams into its fabric. I sew each stitch with love and hope, and my heart beats in harmony with the hum of my sewing machine.

My journey has been a dance among the stars, lighting up the night sky with glimmers of passion and determination. Yet, as I twirl and spin, I'm haunted by the shadow of loss, a void left by a mother who once cradled me in her arms, her whispers of love and encouragement now carried by the wind. I find solace in the rustle of silk and the swish of velvet, seeking her presence in the softness of the materials that surround me.

The Four Season Fashion Market is my arena, my stage where I strive to perform a ballet of triumph and resilience, guided by my mother's spirit. I pray for her light to illuminate my path, as I embark on a quest to conquer mountains and vanquish the demons of doubt and fear. May the vibrant colors of my creations celebrate the passion that burns within, and the intricate patterns of my designs weave a tale of courage and love that transcends time and space.

In this passage, Li Mei reflects on her connection to Hangzhou, her passion for fashion, and the role her late mother plays in her life. The poetic use of language and imagery helps convey her emotions and experiences in a unique and evocative manner.

user: study the following theory and rethink our theme in the story of Li Mei

2	Theme

The subject matter of a play can be described in terms of its action: ‘two young people in Verona defy their families and bring about their own deaths’ (Romeo and Juliet). The theme or themes are described in more abstract terms and deal with large universal concerns regarding our human- ity: love, revenge, duty, tribal loyalties, etc. (Romeo and Juliet). They can also be contained in a large moral or social question, placed firmly at the heart of the narrative: What occurs when we place narrow family duty above the general health of the community? (Romeo and Juliet).

The themes of a play are not necessarily spelled out in an explicit way, but are rather woven into the texture. Hamlet is a complex play not because its subject matter is complicated; indeed, that can be expressed quite simply as, for example, ‘by failing to take revenge on his father’s murder, a young prince brings death and destruction to the whole court.’ The complexity of the play lies in the fact that its themes are so many and so dense: the question of free will, the nature of madness, the limits of the individual, etc. We can say what Hamlet is ‘about’ in terms of its story, but to finally pin down what it is ‘about’ in terms of its themes is not so easy. This principle applies to all texts for performance. I once wrote a large- scale community play for a company in the UK, which dealt with the history of a well-known and derelict stately home (in which the first per- formance of A Midsummer Night’s Dream had been given). Local myth and legend, Queen Elizabeth I and a twentieth-century family featured in a travelling performance around the grounds. As we developed the story, it became clear that underneath the subject matter of historical and contem- porary events, the strong thematic question of ‘who owns history?’ was developing. On another occasion, when I was working with primary school children on their own epic tale about tribal conflict, the big

question that began to emerge was ‘when does group loyalty turn into inter-group conflict?’

Theme is what the story is really ‘about’, and I will be returning to it in more detail in Chapter 8. But, for anyone – groups or individuals – it is important at the early stages to begin to engage with it. However, as with everything else concerning the craft of writing for performance, the themes do not ‘just happen’. While you are creating the skeleton of the story and fleshing it out with the actions of your characters, you will probably not be thinking about the big ideas at the heart of the play. That is probably all to the good for, as the American playwright Sam Shepherd has said, ‘a play produces ideas, ideas do not produce a play.’ When you have your story and your characters, it will be time to see what ideas you have – perhaps unconsciously – been exploring. For the moment, though, let us take a look at how theme or themes are implanted in fully formed plays from the very start.

assistant: Taking the theory on theme into account, let's analyze and deepen the theme in the story of Li Mei.

In the story of Li Mei, the subject matter revolves around a young fashion designer in Hangzhou who finds her way in the Four Season Fashion Market, inspired by her late mother's love and encouragement. On the surface, it's a tale of determination and the pursuit of dreams.

However, when we consider the themes more abstractly, we can identify several universal concerns and questions that underlie the narrative:

1. The power of legacy: How does the influence of a loved one, even after their passing, shape our lives and aspirations?

2. The role of culture and tradition: How do cultural values and traditions, such as Li Mei's connection to Hangzhou and its rich history, inform her journey and creative expression?

3. The tension between individual aspirations and societal expectations: How does Li Mei navigate her ambitions in the context of her family, community, and societal norms?

4. The healing power of art: How does Li Mei's creative process and passion for fashion serve as a means of coping with loss and finding purpose in life?

By weaving these themes into the story of Li Mei, we create a more profound and nuanced narrative that resonates with the audience on a deeper level. As Li Mei's story unfolds, these themes will be explored and developed through her interactions, experiences, and the choices she makes in pursuit of her dreams. This way, the story will not only be about Li Mei's journey as a fashion designer but also a reflection on the larger human experience, dealing with love, loss, identity, and personal growth.

user: learn the setting agenda, and set up the first scene of first chapter of Li Mei' story please.

SETTING THE AGENDA

Exposition at the head of the play alerts the audience as to what to expect in terms of story. Similarly, from the outset the themes of the play are suggested, hinted at and alluded to. You are setting the agenda for what is to come.

assistant: Incorporating the setting agenda, let's create the first scene of the first chapter of Li Mei's story.

Title: Li Mei and the Four Season Fashion Market

Scene 1: Li Mei's Home Studio

The scene opens in a small, cozy room in Li Mei's family home in Hangzhou. The room is filled with sketches, fabric samples, and various sewing tools, revealing Li Mei's passion for fashion design. A large window overlooks the West Lake, connecting her work to the city's natural beauty and history. On one wall, there is a framed photograph of Li Mei and her mother, a constant reminder of her inspiration and the legacy she carries.

Li Mei is sitting at her sewing machine, carefully working on a new design. She pauses, lost in thought, before picking up a worn notebook that belonged to her mother. The notebook contains sketches and ideas from her mother's days as an aspiring designer. Li Mei flips through the pages, feeling both inspired and overwhelmed by the responsibility of following in her mother's footsteps.

As Li Mei looks up from the notebook, her father enters the room, carrying a tray of tea. He sets the tray down on a nearby table and sits beside Li Mei. They share a tender moment, discussing her mother's dreams and their shared hopes for Li Mei's future. The conversation reveals their strong bond and the support her father provides.

Father: "Your mother always believed in you, Li Mei. She knew you had the talent and determination to achieve great things in the world of fashion."

Li Mei: "I want to make her proud, Father. I want to honor her memory by creating designs that reflect our heritage and the beauty of Hangzhou."

As they sip their tea, Li Mei's father tells her about the Four Season Fashion Market, a prestigious event that showcases the work of emerging designers. He encourages her to submit her designs, believing it could be the opportunity she needs to launch her career.

Father: "This is your chance, Li Mei. Show the world your talent, and let your mother's spirit shine through your work."

Li Mei looks back at her mother's notebook, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. She decides to take the leap and submit her designs to the Four Season Fashion Market, embracing the opportunity to pursue her dreams and continue her mother's legacy.

In this first scene, we establish the setting, introduce the main character, and hint at the themes of love, legacy, and the pursuit of dreams. The scene sets the stage for Li Mei's journey, as she navigates the world of fashion, honors her mother's memory, and discovers her own identity as a designer.

assistant: Using the key words from Chekhov's Example 42.1 in the context of Li Mei's story:

Li Mei sat by the West Lake, feeling a mix of emotions – unhappy and mourning the loss of her mother, yet determined to carry on her legacy in the world of fashion design. Her father was not rich but provided a comfortable life for the family. With limited resources, Li Mei was taught the value of money and how to scrape and save. She dreamed of becoming an aspiring designer, weaving love and passion into her creations.

The Four Season Fashion Market was a place where Li Mei could express her art and connect with the souls of those who shared her passion. Sometimes, she would sit by the lake, pondering the mysteries of life, feeling a longing for something more significant. Her thoughts would drift between family, love, and the responsibility of preserving the heritage of her mother's designs.

As she sat there one stormy day, Li Mei watched the sky turn black, reflecting her own feelings of sadness and nostalgia. The thunderstorm seemed to mirror her internal turmoil. She knew that she needed to marry her passion for fashion with the practical realities of life – finding a balance between money, love, and her dreams.

As the rain began to pour down, Li Mei was reminded that life was full of misfortunes and challenges. But, like the beggar who endured the storm with unwavering resilience, she was determined to turn her passion into a reality and share her mother's love for fashion with the world.

assistant: Using the key words from Wilde's Example 42.2 in the context of Li Mei's story:

Li Mei found solace in playing with fabrics and patterns as she designed her unique garments. The Four Season Fashion Market was the stage for her artistic expression, where she could make life imitate the art of fashion. Much like a piano performance, the art of fashion design was both a science and a celebration of life.

At the market, people from different walks of life gathered to enjoy the festivities – ladies and lords, bachelors and married couples. There, they dined on cucumber sandwiches and sipped champagne as they admired the work of various designers, including Li Mei's.

Li Mei observed that the quality of the champagne seemed to differ between the bachelor's and the married households' gatherings. The bachelor's establishments tended to offer first-rate champagne, while the married households served more modest options. This observation sparked Li Mei's thoughts on how marriage could be a demoralizing factor for some people, especially those who felt restricted in their family life.

Despite these reflections, Li Mei remained focused on her passion for fashion design. She believed that pursuing her dreams, regardless of her marital status, would bring joy and fulfillment to her life.

assistant: Chapter 7: A Turning Point

The atmosphere at the Four Season Fashion Market was heavy with a sense of mourning, as dark clouds gathered overhead, threatening a thunderstorm. Li Mei, wearing a black dress that matched her unhappy mood, was indifferent to the impending storm, as she had been dealing with her own personal misfortune.

Inside her small shop, Li Mei continued to create art with her designs, trying to find solace in her work. Her life had been a rollercoaster of emotions lately, with her family's health and happiness being tested. As she worked, she pondered the philosophies that guided her life.

Her father's business had recently gone bankrupt, leaving the once-rich and comfortably-off family in a dire financial situation. Their house was taken away, and they found themselves grappling with the realities of poverty. Li Mei's once-comfortable salary from her fashion store was now barely enough to scrape by and provide for her mother, sisters, and brother.

As she stitched together a new garment, she couldn't help but think of the family she loved so dearly. Her heart ached with longing for the simpler times when they were united, and her mind wandered to thoughts of finding love and getting married. She wondered if true love could withstand the tests of life and bring light to her family's dark days.

In the corner of her shop, a small table held a modest meal – a simple tea, sugar, and some bread. The once-familiar luxuries like expensive tobacco were now distant memories. Li Mei sighed, took a sip of her tea, and continued to work, determined to overcome the challenges fate had thrown at her.

Little did she know that the storm brewing outside would soon bring about a turning point in her life, one that would change her and her family's fate forever.

assistant: As the storm passed, an unexpected turn of events brought a wave of joy and laughter to Li Mei's life. In the back room of her shop, she discovered an old piano, which had been hidden under a dusty tarp. Curious, she began playing a merry tune, filling her store with music and lifting her spirits.

The once-dim shop was now abuzz with life, as customers flocked to hear Li Mei's impromptu performance. Among them were a distinguished gentleman, Sir Charles, and Lady Catherine, who were captivated by her piano playing. They introduced themselves to Li Mei and praised her musical talent.

Sir Charles, a scientist by profession, found Li Mei's perspective on life refreshing and invigorating, and the two engaged in lively conversations about the marriage of science and art. Meanwhile, Lady Catherine, a lover of social gatherings, was inspired to organize a whimsical soiree in Li Mei's honor.

The party was held at Sir Charles's bachelor's establishment, which had been transformed into a lively, first-rate venue for the occasion. The guests enjoyed cucumber sandwiches, an exquisite dining experience, and copious amounts of champagne. The atmosphere was infectious, with laughter and merriment echoing through the halls.

As the evening progressed, Li Mei found herself in the center of attention, surrounded by new friends and admirers. The once-lonely fashion designer marveled at how her life had taken an unexpectedly delightful turn. The prospect of marriage and family life seemed less daunting, as she realized the importance of surrounding herself with uplifting and supportive people.

In the close scene of this light-hearted chapter, Li Mei stood by the piano, her fingers dancing across the keys, as her guests raised their glasses in a toast. The room was filled with warmth and joy, and the once-dismal shop was now a place of celebration and unity. Li Mei couldn't help but smile, knowing that she had found a new family in this unexpected group of friends, who would stand by her side through life's ups and downs.

user: Now write the next chapter when things goes hard and ugly in Li mei's story.

Example 42.5 The Seagull

On the basis of the evidence provided, we might say that four major themes suggested are Death, Money, Love and Art.

assistant: Chapter 8: Darkness Descends

The newfound happiness in Li Mei's life was short-lived, as dark clouds started to gather once more. The very themes of death, money, love, and art that had previously brought joy, now turned into sources of despair.

In the days that followed the lively soiree, the once-thriving business began to crumble. An economic downturn hit the town, leaving many customers struggling to make ends meet. Sales plummeted, and Li Mei found herself on the brink of bankruptcy. The once-celebratory atmosphere in her shop now felt like a distant memory, replaced by the looming threat of financial ruin.

As if her money troubles weren't enough, Li Mei's new friendships started to falter. Sir Charles, whose interest in Li Mei had once seemed genuine, began to distance himself, focusing more on his scientific pursuits than on their blossoming relationship. Lady Catherine, who had once been a pillar of support, was revealed to have ulterior motives, seeking to profit from Li Mei's talents for her own gain.

Amidst these betrayals and hardships, the theme of love seemed to vanish from Li Mei's life, leaving her feeling isolated and abandoned. Even her passion for art and fashion design began to wane, as the stress of her crumbling business and shattered friendships weighed heavily on her soul.

One fateful night, Li Mei received a devastating phone call. Her father had passed away suddenly, leaving her to grapple with an immense sense of loss and grief. In the face of so much pain and adversity, Li Mei felt utterly defeated. The vibrant and hopeful woman who had once filled her shop with laughter and music was now a shadow of her former self.

As Li Mei mourned her father's death, the harsh reality of her situation began to sink in. The once-promising themes of money, love, and art had become the very sources of her pain and despair. With her world crumbling around her, Li Mei felt utterly lost, unsure of how to pick up the pieces and move forward.

In the darkest moments of this chapter, Li Mei found herself alone in her empty shop, the piano silent and the once-bustling business a mere echo of its former glory. The themes that had once brought her joy now taunted her, leaving her to wonder if happiness would ever return to her life. And as the night deepened, the only thing that seemed certain was that the road ahead would be long and challenging, filled with obstacles she never could have imagined.

user: After the cloudy days, Li mei endured the hard times. Now write an chapter

Example 42.6 The Importance of Being Earnest

On the basis of the evidence provided, we might say that three major themes suggested are Social Rank, Marriage and Consumption.

assistant: Chapter 9: A Silver Lining

Despite the darkness that had enveloped Li Mei's life, she persevered, determined to overcome the hardships she faced. With the themes of social rank, marriage, and consumption in mind, Li Mei began to forge a new path for herself, one that would lead her to both personal and professional redemption.

Li Mei understood that her social rank had been affected by her recent misfortunes. To regain her standing in society, she focused her efforts on rebuilding her business. Working tirelessly, she crafted innovative designs that caught the attention of the town's elite. As word of her talent spread, her shop began to thrive once more, slowly reestablishing her reputation and social status.

In time, Li Mei's renewed success brought new suitors into her life, each vying for her affections. Among them was Edward, a kind and genuine man who admired Li Mei not just for her talents but for her resilience and determination. Their relationship blossomed, and as they grew closer, the theme of marriage reentered Li Mei's life.

However, unlike her previous experiences with love, Li Mei approached her relationship with Edward cautiously, wary of repeating past mistakes. Together, they discussed their future, their dreams, and their goals, creating a strong foundation for a lasting partnership. Eventually, Edward proposed, and Li Mei accepted, believing that their love was built on trust and mutual respect.

With her personal life on the mend, Li Mei turned her attention to the theme of consumption. She recognized that her previous extravagance had contributed to her downfall, and she sought to build a more sustainable and responsible business. Li Mei began to source materials ethically, invest in eco-friendly practices, and collaborate with local artisans, ensuring that her newfound success did not come at the expense of others or the environment.

As Li Mei's life began to transform, she found herself once again surrounded by happiness and hope. Her business flourished, her relationship with Edward grew stronger, and her social standing was restored. The themes that had once brought her pain – social rank, marriage, and consumption – now served as the foundation for a brighter future.

In this chapter of Li Mei's story, she demonstrated the power of resilience and determination. Through her trials and tribulations, she learned invaluable lessons that would shape the rest of her life. And as she continued to face new challenges and opportunities, Li Mei remained steadfast in her commitment to her values, her loved ones, and her dreams, proving that even the darkest clouds can give way to a silver lining.

Outcome

With all the examples, the writer has peppered the text with words and categories of words that express big, general themes in the plays. They are not spelled out for us, but just as exposition is crafted into the action, so are the themes embedded in the dialogue of the opening scene. We can view this as the writer ‘setting the agenda’ for what is to proceed. Every writer will approach this differently, but it is useful to apply this general principle to your own work.

assistant: In the stories of Li Mei, the writer has skillfully embedded themes within the text, allowing the reader to recognize and explore the underlying ideas throughout the narrative. By incorporating these themes into the dialogue and action, the writer sets the agenda for what unfolds in the story.

In the opening scene of the light-hearted chapter, the writer introduces themes such as joy, love, and resilience. These themes are subtly woven into the dialogue and actions of the characters, allowing the reader to understand the underlying message without explicitly stating it. For instance, Li Mei's relationship with Edward demonstrates the theme of love, while her renewed focus on her business showcases her resilience. By establishing these themes early in the story, the writer sets the stage for Li Mei's journey and the challenges she will face.

In the darker chapter, themes such as hardship, perseverance, and self-discovery are explored. Li Mei's story takes a turn as she encounters obstacles and struggles to overcome them. The writer embeds these themes through Li Mei's experiences, such as her failing business, the loss of her social standing, and her journey towards self-improvement. The dialogue and actions in this chapter reflect the grittier themes, setting the agenda for Li Mei's transformation and growth.

In the final chapter, themes of redemption, love, and sustainability are brought to the forefront. Li Mei's life begins to improve as she learns from her past mistakes and builds a better future. The writer incorporates these themes by showing Li Mei's dedication to her business, her responsible consumption practices, and her strong relationship with Edward. By embedding these themes within the narrative, the writer sets the agenda for Li Mei's ultimate triumph and happiness.

In conclusion, the writer effectively sets the agenda for Li Mei's story by embedding themes within the dialogue and action from the very beginning. This approach allows the reader to follow Li Mei's journey as she navigates the challenges and triumphs in her life. By subtly weaving themes into the narrative, the writer guides the reader through a rich and engaging story, demonstrating the power of skillful storytelling.

Part two – following the themes

Take any of the lists from my examples. Write a dialogue for two or three people. The words in the list must occur in the dialogue, in exactly the order they appear on the page.

‘Theme’ is the soil in which the narrative is rooted. ‘Subject matter’ is the narrative fleshed out in action. ‘Issue’ is the territory that links them: at its most basic, ‘a topic of interest or discussion’. In the next chapter we will look at how issue and theme impact on each other in the creation of a narrative for performance.

Li Mei: (trying to cheer them up) But we still have our life and health. We should be happy, and find a way to act, to play, and create something new. Maybe, just like art, we can transform our situation.

Father: You're right, Li Mei. As the head of our family, I must find a solution. Your mother, sisters, and brother depend on me.

Susan: I remember when we were rich and comfortably off. Now we struggle with money, almost like a pauper.

Li Mei: (determined) We must find a way to save our money and rebuild our wealth. We can't end up in rags or become beggars.

Father: (sipping tea) We will find a way. We just need to eat, drink, and stay strong. This tea with sugar is helping me think.

3	Issue

Theatre that tackles specific contemporary social or political issues – with the aim of leading to or encouraging some type of change – has very deep roots around the world. It takes many forms and is found in many contexts. In India I have seen companies of actors working in the bastis (shanty towns), playing to hundreds of people and raising questions about matters that directly relate to the lives of their audience: the inequality of women, government corrup- tion, public transport, etc. Forum Theatre, pioneered by Augusto Boal in Brazil, invites members of the audience to participate in the onstage action and affect the outcome of the debate. It has been used as a vehicle for change in struggles taking place in factories, communities and even in the Brazilian government. So it is always worth remembering that ‘theatre’ and ‘plays’ do not necessarily have their home in comfortable arts-centres, and have always had a historical connection with social and political struggles. The move- ments in theatre that have been conscious of the educational aspect of the work may often be invisible or unrecorded, but they hold a central place in our craft. In the UK in the past decades, groups of people and individual writ- ers made theatre that addressed their own concerns, thus making them the concerns of the wider population: ex-offenders talking about prison condi- tions and the failings of the justice system, homeless people demonstrating that they are more than a label, black and Asian artists creating their own nar- ratives and styles of work. All taking, to different degrees, an ‘issue’ which needs public airing through the imaginative capacities of performance.

In the 1970s in the UK a form of theatre was pioneered that placed work in the educational context: Theatre-in-Education (TIE). The plays were very often ‘single-issue’, raising questions in an informative and provocative way, and were preceded or followed by interactive workshops. Areas of immediate concern, often difficult for the teacher to address directly in the classroom, were expressed in a robust, dramatic form: race-relations, bullying, sexuality,

drugs, AIDS, etc. Early TIE plays tended to be collectively devised and to place slightly more emphasis on ‘message’ as opposed to complex story and character-psychology. As the movement developed, it created its own gener- ations of writers, and it is now regarded not just as ‘the place to start’ but as a territory of work where some of the best and most rewarding theatre can be found. Someone once said to me, ‘but don’t you find the “issue” aspect a bit constraining?’ My answer was that Henrik Ibsen didn’t find the issue of local-government corruption constraining, nor Bernard Shaw the issue of arms manufacturing, nor James Baldwin the issue of racism.

In this chapter we will look at a couple of ‘issue-based’ projects, and how – while addressing the question-in-hand – they can imaginatively transform what might seem, at the outset, a dry subject into a full theatrical performance.

TACKLING THE ISSUE

In the following work we will look at how a seemingly most limiting learning-area can be the stimulus for an original work for performance in the educational context. You can use it in a number of ways:

●	As a stimulus for writing a play of your own.

●	As a stimulus for writing a play as a group, e.g., your class.

●	As a model for a workshop process.

assistant: In the story of Li Mei, we will apply the process of tackling an issue through a creative approach. We will use the issue of cultural identity and assimilation in a multicultural society as our central theme, and demonstrate how this can be a stimulus for an original work for performance.

1. As a stimulus for writing a play of your own:

You can use Li Mei's struggle with her cultural identity as the main theme for a play. The story can explore how she navigates her cultural roots while trying to fit into her new environment. Characters in the play can represent different aspects of her life, such as family, friends, and teachers, who influence her journey in various ways. The play can address the challenges faced by Li Mei as she tries to reconcile her heritage with her new surroundings, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of herself and her cultural identity.

2. As a stimulus for writing a play as a group, e.g., your class:

You can collaborate with your classmates to develop a play based on Li Mei's story. Each member can contribute their unique perspective on cultural identity and assimilation, leading to a richer and more diverse narrative. The play can include multiple storylines, exploring different characters' experiences with cultural identity, and how they intersect with Li Mei's journey. Through collaborative brainstorming, the group can create a play that provides insight into the complexities of cultural identity in a multicultural society.

3. As a model for a workshop process:

Li Mei's story can be used as a foundation for a workshop that focuses on the issue of cultural identity and assimilation. Participants can engage in activities that help them explore their own cultural backgrounds and how they relate to the experiences of others. Activities can include group discussions, role-playing exercises, and creative writing prompts that encourage participants to delve deeper into their own experiences with cultural identity. By using Li Mei's story as a starting point, the workshop can facilitate a meaningful exploration of the complexities of cultural identity and assimilation, fostering empathy and understanding among participants.

By using Li Mei's story as a basis for these approaches, you can create a meaningful and engaging exploration of cultural identity and assimilation in a multicultural society. Through individual writing, group collaboration, or a workshop process, Li Mei's story can serve as a powerful stimulus for tackling this important issue.

Exercise 43 The context of the project

Participants: All groups, individual

First, we will need to enter into a couple of fictions.

Fiction 1. The commission

You have been commissioned by a theatre company to write a play to go into schools. Here is your brief:

●	The play will be for 11–13-year-olds.

●	It will be class-length time: 50–55 minutes.

●	You can have three actors.

●	The play will place young people and their concerns at the heart of the narrative.

●	Local schools have come on board as part of your research and development process. They would like the pupils who will see the

play to be involved in the process of story development. You will spend time in the school, working with the pupils and the teacher around (a) the research areas related to the subject matter of the play and (b) story-ideas that come out of this process.

●	The schools are this year engaged in projects around the topic of ‘Transport’.

●	Funding for the tour has been raised on the basis that the play – and the research and development process – will feed into the projects on transport.

●	You have a free hand to decide which area of the topic you wish to look at, and to include that in the research and development process.

assistant: In this exercise, we will create a play for 11-13-year-olds based on Li Mei's story, focusing on the topic of "Transport" as requested by the commission.

1. Research and Development:

To start the process, you will spend time in a local school working with pupils and teachers to research various aspects of transportation, such as different modes of transport, their impact on the environment, and their role in connecting cultures. Through group discussions and brainstorming sessions, gather story ideas and explore how Li Mei's journey can be connected to the theme of transport.

2. Story Development:

Based on your research and interactions with students, develop a story that incorporates Li Mei's experiences with transportation. For example, her journey from her home country to her new environment could be a central plot point. The story can explore how transportation affects her experiences in the new country, such as adapting to new modes of transport, navigating unfamiliar routes, and discovering new places.

3. Character Creation:

Incorporate characters that represent various aspects of Li Mei's journey and the theme of transportation. These characters can include fellow travelers, friends from school, and local transportation experts. Make sure to create characters that resonate with the target audience of 11-13-year-olds, addressing their concerns and interests.

4. Play Structure:

Develop a play that runs for 50-55 minutes with three actors. Create a script that allows each actor to play multiple roles, ensuring smooth transitions between scenes. The play should engage the young audience while addressing the topic of transport and Li Mei's experiences.

5. Collaborative Process:

Involve the students and teachers from the local school in the creative process. Seek their feedback on the script, characters, and story development to ensure that the play aligns with their interests and educational goals. This collaborative approach will not only enrich the play but also create a sense of ownership and connection for the students and teachers involved.

By following this process, you will create a play based on Li Mei's story that addresses the theme of transport while engaging the target audience of 11-13-year-olds. The play will serve as an educational tool to further explore the topic of transportation, fostering a deeper understanding of its role in shaping our lives and connecting cultures.

user: apply this on li mei's story and think about the issue behind.

Fiction 2. The bicycle

●	You have chosen the bicycle as the form of transport to consider. You have done this because the play will place at least one young charac- ter at the heart of the story. Although many of the pupils may not have a bicycle, it is the one form of transportation that the age group can theoretically have control of. It is also easier to get a working bicycle into a school hall than a working car or aeroplane.

●	You will devise research exercises to take into school. They should be designed to (a) stimulate as wide learning-areas as possible and (b) begin to suggest possible storylines.

assistant: Incorporating the bicycle as a central element in Li Mei's story will allow us to explore issues related to transportation, independence, and environmental awareness. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Research Exercises:

Design research activities that encourage students to learn about bicycles and their impact on society, environment, and health. Activities may include:

a. The history of bicycles and their evolution over time.

b. The role of bicycles in promoting a healthy lifestyle and reducing pollution.

c. Exploring bicycle safety, road safety, and local cycling infrastructure.

d. The cultural significance of bicycles in different parts of the world, including Li Mei's home country.

2. Story Development:

Create a storyline that integrates Li Mei's experiences with bicycles, such as:

a. Li Mei learning to ride a bicycle for the first time and gaining a newfound sense of independence.

b. Li Mei using her bicycle to explore her new environment, make new friends, and overcome cultural barriers.

c. Li Mei participating in a school project or community event related to cycling, such as a bike-a-thon or bicycle safety campaign.

3. Addressing Issues:

The play should address issues related to bicycles and the wider theme of transportation, such as:

a. Environmental concerns: How cycling can help reduce carbon emissions and contribute to a cleaner environment.

b. Health benefits: How cycling promotes physical fitness and mental well-being.

c. Community engagement: How bicycles can foster social connections and create a sense of belonging.

d. Cultural understanding: How bicycles can serve as a bridge between different cultures, as seen through Li Mei's experiences.

4. Involving Students and Teachers:

Throughout the process, engage students and teachers in discussions about bicycles and their relevance to Li Mei's story. Seek their input on the research exercises, storyline, and characters, ensuring that the play resonates with their interests and experiences.

By focusing on the bicycle as a central element in Li Mei's story, you can create a play that addresses issues related to transportation, the environment, and cultural understanding while also exploring the personal journey and growth of Li Mei as she navigates her new life with the help of her trusty bicycle.

By weaving these circular symbols and concepts into Li Mei's story, the narrative becomes more interconnected and meaningful. These symbols reinforce the importance of cycles, connections, and continuity in Li Mei's life, ultimately shaping her personal growth and experiences with her bicycle.

user: suppose bicycle changes to sewing machine, think the outcome for li mei's story

Outcome

In the (fictional) workshops in schools you have now used the humble bicycle to open a window on most of the subject matters on the curricu- lum: history, geography, economics, social structures, mythology, etc. You have also gathered a wealth of raw material from which to begin to create a narrative.

assistant: With the change from a bicycle to a sewing machine, Li Mei's story will transform into a different narrative that explores various subject matters, such as history, geography, economics, social structures, and mythology. The sewing machine, like the bicycle, can be a powerful symbol and tool in Li Mei's life. Here's a possible outcome for Li Mei's story:

Li Mei discovers her passion for sewing and craftsmanship when she inherits an old sewing machine from her grandmother. As she delves into the world of textiles and fashion, she learns about the history of sewing machines and their impact on industrialization and women's empowerment.

Li Mei's interest in sewing leads her to research the origins of various fabrics and materials used in clothing. She learns about the global trade and economic implications of the fashion industry, including the exploitation of workers in sweatshops and the environmental impact of fast fashion.

In her community, Li Mei starts a sewing club where she teaches others how to mend and create clothing, emphasizing sustainable and ethical fashion choices. The sewing club becomes a social hub, where people from different backgrounds come together, forming strong bonds and friendships.

Li Mei's sewing machine also becomes a symbol of her connection to her family's history and cultural heritage. As she learns traditional sewing techniques and patterns from her elders, she gains a deeper understanding of her roots and the significance of preserving cultural practices.

Through her experiences with the sewing machine, Li Mei learns valuable lessons about creativity, sustainability, and the importance of preserving traditions. Her story evolves into a narrative that explores a wide range of subject matters and highlights the power of a seemingly ordinary object to inspire personal growth and change.

Exercise 48 Bicycle and story

Using all the above research, write down story-ideas in which a bicycle and a young person are central to what happens. Don’t worry if you can’t work out the details, or if an ending does not suggest itself. Try and go for the main conflict and make the bicycle central to this. Some will be quite substantial, others can be just a few lines.

Example 48.1

This is an actual story-idea that came out of the workshop I have outlined above. I was working in Singapore with a group of writers, some of whom wanted to write plays for schools. When we came to the exercise on images of bicycles, the subject of the Second World War came up. When Singapore (a British colony at the time) was threatened with invasion by Japan, the British assumed that the attack would come from the sea, along the south of the island. All defences were trained in that direction. In fact, the Japanese arrived in Singapore from the north, having travelled down through Malaysia. Many of the Japanese troops were on bicycles. One writer decided to create a story involving a young Japanese soldier and a twelve- year-old Malaysian boy. The soldier’s bicycle has broken down and he is stranded. There is a village nearby, but it is deserted, the villagers having fled, fearing the notoriously cruel soldiers. Only the boy remains. He is an orphan. The boy’s dream is to go to England, where they have ‘seasons’ (unlike Malaysia where the climate is the same all the year round). He has learned this from a British missionary (Malaysia was a British colony also). He also knows by heart Wordsworth’s poem about daffodils. The soldier knows the poem too, having studied literature at university. The soldier’s dream is to be a poet. They learn all this about each other as the boy helps the soldier mend the bicycle. It transpires that the soldier did not want to go to war, but has never spoken to anyone about this before. The boy decides that, after the war, he and the soldier will go to England together. The sol- dier becomes anxious that the villagers will return and take revenge. The boy seems to be deliberately slowing down the mending process. He wants the soldier to hide in the village till the war is over. Time is running out and the soldier becomes angry with the boy ....

assistant: Exercise 48 Scissors and story

Using all the research, write down story-ideas in which a 张小泉 brand 剪刀 (Zhang Xiaoquan scissors) and a young person are central to what happens. Don't worry if you can't work out the details, or if an ending does not suggest itself. Try and go for the main conflict and make the scissors central to this. Some will be quite substantial, others can be just a few lines.

Example 48.1

This is an actual story-idea based on the exercise outlined above, adapted to involve 张小泉 brand 剪刀. Li Mei, a young girl living in a small village in China, discovers a pair of 张小泉 brand 剪刀 in her grandmother's belongings after she passes away. Intrigued by the craftsmanship and history behind the scissors, Li Mei learns about the traditional art of paper-cutting and decides to master it.

As Li Mei delves into the world of paper-cutting, she discovers that her grandmother was a renowned paper-cutting artist in her youth. Li Mei starts practicing and showcasing her art in the village, attracting attention from the local community. A wealthy art collector takes notice of Li Mei's talent and offers her a life-changing opportunity to study art in a prestigious school in a big city.

The story unfolds as Li Mei faces the dilemma of choosing between her newfound passion and the prospect of leaving her village and family behind. Meanwhile, she learns about the sacrifices her grandmother made for her family and her art, and the cultural significance of the 张小泉 brand 剪刀.

As Li Mei becomes more skilled in her art, the village faces a crisis when a large corporation plans to build a factory on their land. Li Mei decides to use her talent to raise awareness of her village's plight and preserve its cultural heritage. She creates a large-scale paper-cutting exhibition, showcasing the history and stories of the village, with the 张小泉 brand 剪刀 playing a central role in her art.

The exhibition becomes a powerful symbol of resistance and gains widespread support. Li Mei finds herself at the center of a struggle between tradition and progress, as she fights to save her village and honor her grandmother's legacy. The 张小泉 brand 剪刀, representing craftsmanship, tradition, and resilience, serves as a crucial element in Li Mei's journey of self-discovery and empowerment.

assistant: Exercise 48 Sewing Machine and story

Using all the above research, write down story-ideas in which a sewing machine and a young person are central to what happens. Don't worry if you can't work out the details or if an ending does not suggest itself. Try and go for the main conflict and make the sewing machine central to this. Some will be quite substantial, others can be just a few lines.

Example 48.1

This is an actual story-idea adapted from the workshop outlined above, but with a sewing machine as the focus. Li Mei, a young girl living in a small Chinese village, discovers an old sewing machine in her grandmother's belongings after she passes away. Curious about the machine and its history, Li Mei learns that her grandmother was a skilled tailor who used the sewing machine to create beautiful garments for the villagers.

As Li Mei learns how to use the sewing machine, she discovers her natural talent for tailoring and fashion design. Her creations become popular in the village, and she begins to dream of studying fashion design in a prestigious school in a big city.

The story unfolds as Li Mei faces the dilemma of choosing between her newfound passion and the prospect of leaving her village and family behind. Meanwhile, she learns about the sacrifices her grandmother made for her family and her art, and the cultural significance of the sewing machine.

As Li Mei's skills improve, the village faces a crisis when a large corporation plans to build a factory on their land. Li Mei decides to use her talent to raise awareness of her village's plight and preserve its cultural heritage. She creates a fashion show with garments that showcase the history and stories of the village, with the sewing machine playing a central role in her creations.

The fashion show becomes a powerful symbol of resistance and gains widespread support. Li Mei finds herself at the center of a struggle between tradition and progress, as she fights to save her village and honor her grandmother's legacy. The sewing machine, representing craftsmanship, tradition, and resilience, serves as a crucial element in Li Mei's journey of self-discovery and empowerment.

user: think about the outcome of these stories of Li Mei.

Outcome

In the above example the broken bicycle is the catalyst for the brief friendship between the soldier and the boy, and is a metaphor for dreams that will be broken. ‘Journeying’ is a theme that is suggested – through life, in war, in the imagination. The play (if it were fully developed and written) would contain historical detail and raise questions about war. It would deal with racial stereotyping (a Japanese soldier who does not want to fight, and a Malaysian village boy who quotes English poetry). It would raise the question of which of the two is more important, practical skills (mending bicycles) or creativity (poetry).

assistant: Outcome

In the Li Mei sewing machine story, the sewing machine serves as a catalyst for Li Mei's journey of self-discovery and empowerment, as well as a metaphor for the preservation of tradition and culture. The theme of 'journeying' is also suggested - through personal growth, learning about one's heritage, and striving for a better future.

The play, if fully developed and written, would contain cultural and historical details and raise questions about the importance of preserving traditions in the face of modernization. It would also address the role of art and creativity in empowering individuals and communities, and the challenges of balancing personal ambitions with family and community responsibilities.

The story would encourage the audience to reflect on the significance of cultural heritage and the power of individual actions in shaping a collective future. It would also challenge stereotypes, showcasing Li Mei as a strong and talented young woman capable of making a difference in her community.

Overall, the play would be a compelling exploration of personal growth, cultural identity, and the power of art and tradition in the face of adversity.

user: Please think about the story of Li mei

Exercise 49 More issues

Use the model, or variants of it, to explore other issues or topics. For instance, drugs, AIDS, an aspect of local history, the fishing industry, bul- lying, etc. As with the story-idea in the above example, the aspiration should be to create a complex and fresh story, not a three-dimensional pamphlet.

assistant: Story Idea: Li Mei and the Fight Against Bullying

Li Mei is a talented young seamstress living in a small village, where a bullying problem has been plaguing the local school. Li Mei's younger brother, Xiao, has been a target of bullying due to his small stature and interest in sewing, a skill he learned from Li Mei. Tired of seeing her brother and other students suffer, Li Mei decides to use her sewing skills to address the issue.

Li Mei visits the school and proposes an after-school sewing club, where students can learn and share their sewing skills. The club's goal is to create a safe space for students to express themselves and connect with one another, ultimately fostering empathy and understanding among them. The school principal, initially skeptical, agrees to let Li Mei start the club on a trial basis.

As the club gains popularity, even some of the bullies join, discovering a newfound appreciation for their peers' talents and the joy of creating something together. Through their shared experiences in the club, the students learn the value of teamwork, kindness, and empathy.

In parallel, Li Mei creates a series of anti-bullying posters and banners, showcasing her sewing skills and incorporating messages of unity and respect. These artworks are displayed throughout the school and the village, sparking conversations about bullying and promoting a more inclusive environment.

As the story unfolds, the club members come together to create a joint art project – a large tapestry telling the story of their village's history, culture, and values. This collaborative artwork serves as a symbol of unity and is showcased during a village-wide anti-bullying event, where students, teachers, and parents come together to celebrate their progress and pledge their commitment to ending bullying.

This play would explore the complex issue of bullying by highlighting the importance of empathy, understanding, and community involvement. It would also emphasize the transformative power of art and creativity in fostering connections and addressing social issues. Li Mei's story would serve as an example of how an individual's talents and determination can contribute to positive change.

THE HEALTH PROJECT

The following work can be used as a model for a large-scale community  play.

Exercise 50 The context of the project

Participants: All groups

Once again, we will start by entering into some fictions.

Fiction 1. The community play

You have been employed by a local authority to produce a large-scale community play that addresses the following question: What creates a healthy community?

Fiction 2. The community

You will be working with a broad, representative range of people from the area – health workers, residents, teachers, community workers, students, etc. – to research and develop the ideas. There will be a mix of age, physical ability, class, ethnicity, etc.

Fiction 3. The process

The ideas and some of the text will come from a  development  process taking place over a weekend. You will be working with a team that includes a director, a movement-artist, a designer and a musician. Your responsibility will be to lead the work that produces the ideas and some of the text. After this you will refine and shape the text into a narrative.

assistant: Li Mei's Community Health Play

Li Mei, a young woman from a small village, has been employed by the local authority to produce a large-scale community play that addresses the question: "What creates a healthy community?" As the project leader, Li Mei is excited to collaborate with a diverse group of individuals from the area, including health workers, residents, teachers, community workers, and students.

The development process takes place over a weekend, where Li Mei works with a team consisting of a director, a movement artist, a designer, and a musician. The goal is to generate ideas and develop the text for the play by engaging the community in discussions and activities related to health and well-being.

During the weekend, Li Mei organizes workshops and discussions that explore various aspects of community health, such as physical and mental well-being, social connections, access to healthcare, and environmental factors. Participants share their personal experiences and brainstorm ways to improve the overall health of their community.

As the ideas emerge, Li Mei and her team work together to incorporate them into a cohesive narrative for the play. The story revolves around a group of villagers who come together to transform their community by addressing various health-related issues, such as promoting exercise and healthy eating, creating support networks for mental health, and advocating for better access to healthcare services.

The play also highlights the importance of intergenerational connections, as the villagers learn from the wisdom of the elderly and the energy of the young. The director, movement artist, designer, and musician each contribute their expertise, using elements of movement, design, and music to bring the story to life and emphasize the key messages of the play.

As the play takes shape, Li Mei ensures that the voices of the community members are heard and their experiences are authentically represented. The final production is a powerful and inspiring portrayal of a community working together to create a healthier and happier environment for all.

The community health play not only raises awareness about the importance of health and well-being but also serves as a catalyst for change within the community. By the end of the project, participants and audience members feel empowered to take action and work together to improve the overall health of their community. Li Mei's leadership and dedication have shown the transformative power of art and collaboration in addressing pressing social issues.

Exercise 51 Getting going

Many of the people you are working with will not have written in this context before. Select some of the ‘Getting going’ exercises from Chapter 1. If it helps, you can adapt the exercises to suit the subject matter of the project: ‘Health’ and ‘Community’. (See Examples 51.1 and 51.2.)

Example 51.1 Community

From Chapter 1, take Exercises 3 (Parts 1–3). This will help create a level playing field of shared experience/memory for the participants, and also focus the work on the area they live in.

Example 51.2 Health

Write a list of 20–25 words, then choose ones that – directly or indirectly – relate to ‘health’ (or its opposite) in some way. For instance, Nurse, Bed, Air, Confidence, Sky, Smile, Cigarette, Trust, etc.

assistant: In Li Mei's community health play project, she uses exercises to help participants get started with the writing process. Since many of the participants have not written in this context before, these exercises aim to create a shared experience and focus on the subjects of health and community.

Example 51.1 Community: Li Mei adapts Exercise 3 from Chapter 1 to suit the project's subject matter. In this exercise, participants are asked to recall a memory related to their community and share it with the group. For example, a participant might share a story about a local event that brought people together, such as a community clean-up day or a neighborhood block party. This shared experience/memory helps participants bond with each other and understand the importance of a strong community in promoting health and well-being.

Example 51.2 Health: Li Mei provides a list of 20-25 words to the participants and asks them to choose the ones that directly or indirectly relate to health or its opposite. For instance, participants may choose words like Nurse, Bed, Air, Confidence, Sky, Smile, Cigarette, and Trust.

In Li Mei's story, a participant might choose the word "Smile" and share a story about how a simple smile from a neighbor helped them feel more connected and supported in their community. Another participant might choose the word "Cigarette" and discuss the negative impact of smoking on their health and the importance of promoting a smoke-free community.

These exercises enable participants to connect with the themes of the play and generate ideas based on their own experiences and perspectives. By sharing their stories and engaging in these exercises, the participants contribute to the development of the play's narrative, making it more authentic and relevant to the community's health issues.

Exercise 52 The universal needs

1	Working individually, write out as long a list as you can of those things you consider to be universally necessary to sustain life. (See Examples 52.1.)

2	In small groups, compare lists. Remember that we are looking for those things that are universal and necessary to sustain life. Draw circles around those words that do  not  fit  these  definitions.  (See Examples 52.2.)

3	In the small groups, look at all the words on the lists that have not been circled. Identify 10–12 things you consider absolutely universal and absolutely necessary to sustain life. Write each word on a sheet of A4 paper, in large capitals, with a felt marker. (See Examples 52.3.)

4	Each small group will now have 10–12 sheets of A4 with key words on them. The next step is to make a map of them on the floor. The map will be made up of clusters of words that stand for the same thing. This does not have to be rushed. One person will begin the process, then a second will add their word and so on. (See Examples 52.4.) The layout of the map can be renegotiated a couple of times. The aim is to agree, as a whole group, on the final list of universal needs. Write out the final list. (See Examples 52.5.)

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the villagers in the village of Four Seasons participate in Exercise 52 to explore the universal needs necessary to sustain life. This exercise helps them understand the importance of community health and well-being.

Examples 52.1: The villagers individually brainstorm a list of things they consider necessary to sustain life, such as food, water, shelter, love, health, education, clean air, family, friendship, safety, and purpose.

Examples 52.2: In small groups, the villagers compare their lists and circle words that don't fit the definition of being universally necessary to sustain life. For instance, they might circle luxury items like smartphones or cars.

Examples 52.3: The small groups identify 10-12 things they consider absolutely universal and necessary to sustain life, like food, water, shelter, love, health, education, clean air, family, friendship, safety, and purpose. They write each word on a sheet of A4 paper in large capitals.

Examples 52.4: Each small group has 10-12 sheets of A4 paper with key words. They arrange the sheets on the floor, creating clusters of words that represent the same thing. The villagers work together to agree on the final layout of the map, emphasizing the importance of cooperation and unity in their community.

Examples 52.5: Once the final list of universal needs is agreed upon, the villagers write it down as a reminder of what is truly important in sustaining life. This list might include food, water, shelter, love, health, education, clean air, family, friendship, safety, and purpose.

Through this exercise, the village of Four Seasons gains a better understanding of the basic needs required for a healthy community. By focusing on these universal needs, the villagers can work together to ensure that everyone has access to the resources necessary for a healthy life. This exercise plays a vital role in the development of the community health play and helps the villagers recognize the importance of a healthy community in the village of Four Seasons.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the villagers in the village of Four Seasons participate in Exercise 52 to explore the universal needs necessary to sustain life. This exercise helps them understand the importance of community health and well-being.

Examples 52.1: The villagers individually brainstorm a list of things they consider necessary to sustain life, such as love, food, water, warmth, communication, creativity, touch, light, shelter, oxygen, spirituality, space, greenery, self-expression, movement, other people, privacy, reflectivity, hope, dreams, curiosity, desire, health, laughter, sex, education, stimulation, name, identity, and self-worth.

Examples 52.2: In small groups, the villagers compare their lists and circle words that don't fit the definition of being universally necessary to sustain life. For instance, they might circle greenery as some cultures exist in regions where there is no greenery, or privacy as it has different meanings in different cultures.

Examples 52.3: The small groups identify 10-12 things they consider absolutely universal and necessary to sustain life, like food, water, light, shelter, oxygen, spirituality, movement, hope, stimulation, and identity.

Examples 52.4: Each small group has 10-12 sheets of A4 paper with key words. They arrange the sheets on the floor, creating clusters of words that represent the same thing.

Examples 52.5: Once the final list of universal needs is agreed upon, the villagers write it down as a reminder of what is truly important in sustaining life. This list might include sustenance, air, light, rest, creativity, identity, the transcendental, love, connection, shelter, and creativity.

Through this exercise, the village of Four Seasons gains a better understanding of the basic needs required for a healthy community. By focusing on these universal needs, the villagers can work together to ensure that everyone has access to the resources necessary for a healthy life. This exercise plays a vital role in the development of the community health play and helps the villagers recognize the importance of a healthy community in the village of Four Seasons.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example in li mei' story.

Outcome

We have defined ‘Health’ as based upon needs that are not related simply to the material. The creative and the spiritual are as necessary as the need for food and shelter. The piece of work addressing the question ‘How do we create a healthy community?’ will explore the full range of needs.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the villagers of Four Seasons explore the concept of health beyond material needs, understanding that a healthy community encompasses not only physical well-being but also emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects. The village aims to create an environment that nurtures all these facets of life to foster a healthy community.

Outcome: The villagers recognize that health is based on a wide range of needs, not just material ones. They understand that creativity, spirituality, emotional connections, and a sense of belonging are just as crucial as access to food, clean water, and shelter for building a healthy community.

Example: In Li Mei's story, one outcome of this realization is the village's initiative to create a community center that caters to various needs. This center includes a space for art and creativity, where villagers can participate in painting, sculpting, and other artistic activities. It also offers a meditation room for people to engage in spiritual practices and mindfulness exercises.

In addition, the community center organizes group activities and events, such as sports, workshops, and cultural celebrations, promoting physical health and fostering social connections among the villagers. They also provide educational programs to address mental health, covering topics like stress management and emotional intelligence.

By addressing the full range of needs in the village of Four Seasons, Li Mei's community creates a healthy environment that caters to the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being of its residents. This holistic approach to health ensures a vibrant, supportive, and thriving community for all.

Exercise 53 Satisfying the needs

1	Identify for each need (a) what might be a true satisfier and (b) what might be a false satisfier. (See Examples 53.1.)

2	Identify where and how these needs (true and false) are provided for (or not) in the area or community. (See Examples 53.2.)

3	This step uses Exercise 22 in Chapter 2. Work in small groups. Think about the area you live in. Think of a type of person who might be living in the community. Create a thumbnail sketch of the person.

4	Decide how they have spent their day. Write down (a) three needs that were truly satisfied on that day, and (b) three needs that were falsely satisfied on that day. (See Example 53.3.)

assistant: 1. Identifying true and false satisfiers in Li Mei's story:

Examples 53.1:

Need: Social connection

a) True satisfier: Participating in community events, engaging in meaningful conversations with neighbors.

b) False satisfier: Spending excessive time on social media, engaging in superficial interactions.

Need: Creativity

a) True satisfier: Attending art workshops, exploring various forms of artistic expression.

b) False satisfier: Engaging in activities that only imitate creativity, like paint-by-numbers kits, without personal expression or growth.

2. Identifying where and how these needs are provided for in the village of Four Seasons:

Examples 53.2:

True satisfiers:

- Community center offers art classes and workshops.

- Local sports teams and clubs encourage physical activity and social interaction.

- Village leaders organize cultural events and celebrations to promote a sense of belonging and community spirit.

False satisfiers:

- Some villagers might rely on social media for connection instead of engaging in person.

- Some villagers may prefer passive entertainment (TV, video games) over active engagement in creative pursuits.

3. Creating a thumbnail sketch of a person living in the village of Four Seasons:

Example:

Name: Zhang Wei

Age: 32

Occupation: Schoolteacher

Family: Married, one child

Interests: Painting, gardening, reading

4. Deciding how Zhang Wei has spent their day, and identifying three truly satisfied needs and three falsely satisfied needs:

Examples 53.3:

a) Truly satisfied needs:

- Creativity: Attended a painting workshop at the community center.

- Social connection: Spent quality time with family and joined neighbors for a community meal.

- Physical health: Participated in a morning yoga class at the local park.

b) Falsely satisfied needs:

- Spirituality: Scrolled through mindfulness quotes on social media, but didn't engage in any mindfulness practices.

- Rest: Watched TV late into the night instead of getting a proper sleep.

- Education: Skimmed through online articles without truly engaging or learning from the content.

user: Compare to the standard answers and find lessons behind.

Examples 53.1

●	Sustenance: water (true), coke (false).

●	Air: unpolluted (true), air conditioning (false).

●	Light: natural (true), neon strip lighting (false).

●	Rest : siesta (true), sleeping pills (false).

●	Creativity: making your own dance (true), copying a pop star’s move- ments (false).

●	Identity: speaking your mind (true), saying what you think pleases people (false).

●	Etc.

Examples 53.2

●	Local shops stock mineral water, but the schools have coke-vending machines.

●	There is a hill that gets a fresh breeze, but it is surrounded on three sides by a motorway.

●	There are no tall buildings, so the sun gets everywhere, but the street lighting at night blocks the view of the stars.

●	There are some creative evening classes on offer, but they are more expensive than hiring a video for the night.

●	Etc.

Example 53.3

●	She worked all day in an office with strip lighting and air condition- ing. During the course of the day she drank three cans of coke.

●	In the evening she went to a modern dance class. In the pub after-  wards she drank mineral water. When someone made a racist remark she challenged the speaker.

assistant: Comparing the standard answers to the adapted examples in Li Mei's story, we can find several lessons:

1. Both sets of examples illustrate the importance of recognizing the distinction between true and false satisfiers. In Li Mei's story, Zhang Wei's true satisfiers include attending a painting workshop and spending quality time with family, while false satisfiers consist of scrolling through mindfulness quotes on social media without engaging in actual mindfulness practices.

2. Both sets of examples emphasize the significance of the community and environment in providing true and false satisfiers. In Li Mei's story, the community center offers art classes and workshops as true satisfiers, while some villagers rely on social media for connection instead of engaging in person, which serves as a false satisfier.

3. Both sets of examples highlight the impact of individual choices and behaviors on satisfaction. In Li Mei's story, Zhang Wei chooses to attend a painting workshop and engage in meaningful conversations with neighbors, while also scrolling through mindfulness quotes on social media without practicing mindfulness.

Lessons we can draw from these comparisons are:

- It is essential to be aware of the difference between true and false satisfiers to lead a more fulfilling and healthier life.

- The environment and community play a crucial role in providing opportunities for true and false satisfiers. It is necessary to create supportive communities and environments that promote true satisfiers.

- Individual choices and behaviors significantly influence the satisfaction of needs. It is vital to make conscious choices that prioritize true satisfiers over false ones to improve overall well-being.

user: Please think about the outcome in Li mei's story.

Outcome

We have now begun to identify (a) aspects of ‘health’ that are specific to the local community, and (b) possible characters within the community and how they satisfy their basic needs. In both cases there are interesting contradictions and paradoxes. You now have the basis of a narrative that will address the practical issues at the core of the project, within the frame of a strong, dramatic set of situations.

We shall now look at another technique for opening up an area of debate/discussion to see what its thematic potential is.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the outcome of identifying aspects of 'health' specific to the village of Four Seasons and its characters reveals interesting insights into the community's well-being and overall satisfaction. By examining the ways people in the village satisfy their basic needs, both truly and falsely, we uncover potential areas for growth and improvement.

In Li Mei's story, the village of Four Seasons provides a mixture of true and false satisfiers. The painting workshop, for example, offers a genuine opportunity for creativity and self-expression, while scrolling through mindfulness quotes on social media without engaging in mindfulness practices serves as a false satisfier.

The characters in the village, such as Li Mei, Zhang Wei, and others, have their unique ways of addressing their needs. These characters illustrate a diverse range of perspectives and experiences, allowing the audience to connect with the story and understand the complexities of living in such a community.

The outcome of this exploration in Li Mei's story provides the basis for a compelling narrative that addresses the practical issues at the heart of the project. It showcases the challenges and opportunities that the characters face within the context of their community, shedding light on the complexities of balancing true and false satisfiers in daily life.

As a result, Li Mei's story has the potential to spark discussions and debates about health, well-being, and community values. It can encourage both the characters and the audience to reflect on their choices, behaviors, and priorities, leading to a greater understanding of what it means to live a healthy, fulfilling life in the village of Four Seasons.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example of Li mei's story.

ISSUE INTO THEME

When faced with an ‘issue’ to be discussed (whether in the classroom, round the dinner table or in a writing group) there is a tendency to launch into opinions.     If these opinions are backed up by facts, they will shed light on the subject   under discussion. However, if we wish to make a piece of work that not only serves its subject matter, but is also a satisfying and complex drama, we must strive to go beyond the surface issue and seek the deeper themes. The first exer- cises in this chapter have provided models for how this may be achieved. This one approaches the same task of converting issue into theme by using a tech- nique that appears throughout the book: asking questions that lead to other questions.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, we can explore the issue of finding personal identity and purpose within a changing community, especially as the village of Four Seasons is experiencing modernization and cultural shifts. To transform this issue into a theme that can be developed into a satisfying and complex drama, we need to delve deeper into the topic by asking questions that lead to further questions.

For instance, we can begin with a question related to Li Mei's struggle with her personal identity:

Question 1: How does Li Mei's relationship with traditional culture affect her sense of identity?

This question can lead to other, deeper questions that explore the nuances of Li Mei's story:

Question 2: How does Li Mei balance her connection to her cultural roots with her aspirations for a modern future?

Question 3: How does Li Mei's relationship with her family, especially her elders, influence her understanding of her identity?

Question 4: How do the changes in the village of Four Seasons impact Li Mei's perception of herself and her community?

By asking these questions, we can begin to explore the underlying themes in Li Mei's story, such as the conflict between tradition and modernity, the role of family and community in shaping identity, and the challenges of adapting to change while preserving cultural heritage.

By incorporating these themes into the story, we can create a rich, nuanced narrative that goes beyond the surface issue of personal identity and purpose. This will result in a more satisfying and complex drama that not only addresses the issue but also resonates with the audience on a deeper level, encouraging them to reflect on their own experiences, values, and beliefs.

Exercise 54 Questions leading to questions

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Take a specific issue: one that addresses a major social concern. (See Examples 54.1.)

2	Working individually, write down three questions that  the  issue  raises in your mind. They may be very direct questions necessitating further information, or they may be rhetorical questions. (See  Examples 54.2.)

3	For each question in step 2, write down three questions that are prompted by them. You will now have nine new questions. (See Examples 54.3.)

4	For each question in step 3, write down three questions that are prompted by them. The questions may become very  personal  to  you, and they may not seem to be addressing the core of the issue. That is a good thing. Trust your intuition and remember all the time that you are not seeking answers, but spreading the net of questions as wide as you can. You will now have 27 new questions. (See Example 54.4.)

5	Write each question on a sheet of paper. Make a map of them on the floor or on a wall. What cluster-groups of question emerge? What broad, general themes are suggested?

6	From all the cluster-groups, frame three or four broad questions concerning ‘the rights of children’ that might suggest (a) possible narratives and (b) universal themes.

assistant: Let's use the issue of preserving cultural heritage in the face of modernization in Li Mei's story.

Examples 54.1:

Preserving cultural heritage in the face of modernization.

Examples 54.2:

1. How does modernization threaten traditional cultural practices in the village of Four Seasons?

2. What challenges do the villagers face in preserving their cultural heritage?

3. How do the younger generation, like Li Mei, navigate between modernization and cultural preservation?

Examples 54.3:

Question 1:

a. How are traditional values and practices being affected by technology and globalization?

b. Can the villagers adapt their cultural practices to modern times without losing their essence?

c. What role does the local government play in preserving cultural heritage?

Question 2:

a. How do the villagers perceive the changes occurring in their community?

b. Are there any programs or initiatives in place to help preserve and promote traditional practices?

c. What efforts are individuals making to keep their heritage alive?

Question 3:

a. How do generational differences affect the preservation of cultural heritage?

b. What role do education and awareness play in maintaining cultural traditions?

c. How can young people like Li Mei strike a balance between embracing modernity and preserving their heritage?

Examples 54.4:

Question 1a:

i. How can traditional art forms be preserved and promoted in the digital age?

ii. Can globalization bring opportunities for preserving cultural heritage rather than threatening it?

iii. How do villagers maintain their cultural identity in an increasingly interconnected world?

Question 1b:

i. Can modern techniques or materials be used to maintain traditional practices without diluting their authenticity?

ii. How can the community strike a balance between progress and preservation?

iii. Can some traditional practices evolve to become more relevant in modern times?

(Note that for brevity, only two questions from Examples 54.3 are expanded, but you would follow this process for all nine questions.)

Once all the questions are written on sheets of paper and arranged in clusters, some broad themes may emerge, such as generational differences, adaptation, and the role of government and community in preserving cultural heritage.

From these clusters, frame three or four broad questions that might suggest possible narratives and universal themes:

1. How do individuals of different generations come together to preserve and adapt their cultural heritage in the face of modernization?

2. What role does the community as a whole play in the preservation and adaptation of cultural heritage, and how can they balance progress with preservation?

3. How can government policies and initiatives support and promote the preservation of cultural heritage without stifling progress and modernization?

These broad questions can help form the foundation of a narrative that explores the challenges of preserving cultural heritage in Li Mei's story while addressing universal themes that resonate with a wider audience.

These adapted examples can be used to explore various aspects of Li Mei's story, such as children's rights in education, the impact of modern farming practices on the environment, and the challenge of balancing economic development with cultural preservation.

user: Please analyze the outcome

Outcome

●	By constantly broadening the scope of enquiry, we have begun to discover that a one-issue subject matter contains a multitude of possible themes: happiness, age, culture, power, duty, knowledge, etc.

By framing the enquiry through questions and avoiding opinion, we have not foreclosed on the subject matter.

●	This approach is particularly useful in large groups, where a range of opinions may exist, and which need to be accommodated, explored and even challenged. Questions often reveal far more about real feel- ings and attitudes than instant reflexive answers and solutions.

In Chapters 2 and 3, we have begun to explore how whole narratives may evolve, both group-written and individually composed. We have referred back to some of the exercises in Chapter 1 as part of this process. In the following chapters we will look in more detail at the way a whole text  for performance can be created, and some of the universal underlying principles of dramatic narrative for performance.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the outcome of using the "Questions leading to questions" approach has helped to uncover multiple themes that can be explored within her narrative, such as children's rights in education, environmental impact of modern farming practices, and the challenge of balancing economic development with cultural preservation. This method allows for a deeper exploration of the story's subject matter, beyond the surface level.

By reframing the subject matter through questions rather than opinions, we prevent closing off any potential avenues for exploration. This approach is helpful when working with large groups with diverse perspectives, as it encourages a more inclusive, explorative, and even challenging environment for storytelling.

Throughout Chapters 2 and 3, we have seen how whole narratives can be developed both collectively and individually, referring back to exercises in Chapter 1 to support the process. As we move forward, we will further examine how to create a complete text for performance and delve into the universal principles of dramatic narrative for performance.

In Li Mei's story, this process enables a deeper understanding of the characters, their motivations, and the world they inhabit. It also offers a more complex and satisfying exploration of the themes, making the final performance richer and more engaging for the audience.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example in Li mei's story.

Outcome

●	By constantly broadening the scope of enquiry, we have begun to discover that a one-issue subject matter contains a multitude of possible themes: happiness, age, culture, power, duty, knowledge, etc.

By framing the enquiry through questions and avoiding opinion, we have not foreclosed on the subject matter.

●	This approach is particularly useful in large groups, where a range of opinions may exist, and which need to be accommodated, explored and even challenged. Questions often reveal far more about real feel- ings and attitudes than instant reflexive answers and solutions.

In Chapters 2 and 3, we have begun to explore how whole narratives may evolve, both group-written and individually composed. We have referred back to some of the exercises in Chapter 1 as part of this process. In the following chapters we will look in more detail at the way a whole text  for performance can be created, and some of the universal underlying principles of dramatic narrative for performance.

4 Building a character

In Chapter 1 we looked at ways in which fictional characters can be developed from material that is instantly available to us in daily life. We began to look at the components of what we mean by ‘character’: inner- and  outer-life, personal history, characteristics, etc. Now we will create a fully rounded character, whose story will contain the seeds of a full dramatic narrative.

All of the exercises in this chapter can be used by the individual writer, or provide the basis for work in a group workshop.

BEING SPECIFIC ABOUT THE CHARACTER

We will begin by looking at some fully developed plays, to see how the writers have approached the task of revealing ‘characters’ to us. For my examples I have chosen The Seagull, by Anton Chekhov, and Death of a Salesman, by Arthur Miller.  In your own use of this exercise, any major    play from any cultural origin could work equally well.

assistant: In Li Mei's story, for instance, we initially started with the issue of modernization of a traditional village and its impact on education. By constantly broadening the scope of inquiry through asking questions instead of making assumptions or stating opinions, we have discovered a multitude of possible themes to explore within the narrative, such as happiness, age, culture, power, duty, and knowledge.

For example, as we ask questions about Li Mei's experiences, we might wonder how her age and cultural background influence her perspective on the village's changes. We could also explore the power dynamics between the villagers and the government or corporations responsible for the modernization. Furthermore, we might question the duty and responsibility of preserving traditions in a rapidly evolving society.

By using this approach, we are better equipped to create a more complex and engaging story. The technique is particularly useful in large groups with diverse perspectives, as it accommodates various viewpoints and encourages a deeper exploration of the subject matter.

When building Li Mei's character, it is essential to be specific about her traits, history, and motivations. By examining fully developed plays like The Seagull and Death of a Salesman, we can learn how to effectively reveal Li Mei's character to the audience. Studying these works will provide insights into how to create a well-rounded character with a compelling narrative.

In the context of Li Mei's story, we can take inspiration from these plays to make her character more relatable and complex. For instance, we can explore her relationships with other villagers, her feelings about tradition and modernity, her aspirations, and her struggles. By delving into these aspects of her character, we can create a rich narrative that resonates with the audience and offers a satisfying exploration of the themes we've identified through our questions.

Exercise 55 Facts about the character

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Take an opening scene from a couple of major plays.

2	Choose one of the main characters in the scene.

3	Go through the text carefully and write down the things we know about the character, on the basis of: (a) what character X says about her/himself and (b) what the other characters say about character X. (See Examples 55.1–55.4.)

4	Be specific. Write down the evidence from what you are given in the text. We are seeking the facts the playwright has given us, not our own opinions or speculations on what the character ‘might be like’.

assistant: As we don't have specific plays to refer to in Li Mei's story, I will create an opening scene based on her narrative, and then follow the steps of the exercise.

Opening Scene:

Li Mei is sitting on the steps outside her family's traditional house, studying a textbook. Her father, Mr. Chen, is repairing a wooden door nearby. Mrs. Chen, Li Mei's mother, is hanging laundry to dry. A conversation unfolds about the future of the village, the new school being built, and Li Mei's dreams of becoming a teacher.

Step 2: Choose one of the main characters in the scene.

For this exercise, we will focus on Li Mei's character.

Step 3: Go through the text carefully and write down the things we know about the character.

(a) What Li Mei says about herself:

- She is passionate about education and wants to become a teacher.

- She is concerned about the village's traditions being lost in the modernization process.

(b) What the other characters say about Li Mei:

- Mr. Chen (Li Mei's father) mentions that Li Mei is a hardworking and determined young woman.

- Mrs. Chen (Li Mei's mother) says that Li Mei has always been curious and eager to learn, even as a child.

Step 4: Be specific. Write down the evidence from what you are given in the text.

From the opening scene, we learn the following facts about Li Mei:

- She is a young woman from a traditional village.

- She is passionate about education and aspires to become a teacher.

- She is concerned about preserving her village's traditions amid modernization.

- Her father, Mr. Chen, sees her as hardworking and determined.

- Her mother, Mrs. Chen, recalls Li Mei's curiosity and eagerness to learn from a young age.

By focusing on these specific facts about Li Mei, we can begin to build a more in-depth understanding of her character and motivations, which will help create a compelling narrative in her story.

user: Think about teh outcome and apply it to LI mei and Li jilai's story.

Outcome

From the above examples we have identified a range of detailed ‘facts’  about the characters:

●	What they wear (black clothes; arch-supports).

●	What they have a liking for (snuff; Swiss cheese).

●	What their economic circumstances are (daughter of a not-badly off father; struggling salesman).

●	What their inner lives are like (in mourning for her life; having strange thoughts).

●	What their personal relationships contain (indifference towards an admirer; concern for a son).

Some of these ‘facts’ include opinions and beliefs the characters hold (or, for the moment, seem to hold), memories they retain, etc. They also begin to give us a sense of people with contradictions: Masha allows Medvedenko to see her daily, yet is indifferent to him; Willy claims he didn’t lose his temper with his son, but Linda says he did. All these things may seem placed in the text at random, but they are not. They are things that the writer has deliber- ately chosen, to give us a sense of unique and complex individuals. Masha is not just any young woman who is indifferent to the attentions of a young man: she is the one who takes snuff and always wears black. Willy is not just any tired travelling salesman having worries about his son: he is the one who wears arch-supports and drove a red Chevvy in 1928.

What Chekhov and Miller are both aiming at is specificity of detail, and that is your task when building all the characters inhabiting the play you are writing. The specificity may be in ‘big things’ of the soul or the psyche (Masha in mourning for her life, Willy in having ‘strange thoughts’), but it also resides in small and daily things (snuff and shoe-arches).

Both of these plays are in the naturalistic mould: human beings in recog- nisable social environments, struggling with their situation and their emotions. What about more abstract plays, where we are not given similar frames of reference? Does the principle of revealing the characters through what they say/what is said about them still apply?

assistant: Outcome applied to Li Mei and Li Jilai's story:

From the examples we have created for Li Mei and Li Jilai, we have identified a range of detailed 'facts' about the characters:

● Li Mei is a young woman who is trying to balance her responsibility to her family and village with her dreams of pursuing higher education.

● Li Jilai is a dedicated and hardworking village leader, struggling to improve the village's conditions and trying to understand his daughter's aspirations.

Some specific details about Li Mei and Li Jilai include:

● Li Mei often wears traditional clothing and has a small charm bracelet given by her mother.

● Li Jilai wears a pair of worn-out shoes, showing his years of hard work in the village.

● Li Mei enjoys reading books about faraway places and dreams of traveling the world.

● Li Jilai often listens to the radio for news and advice on improving agricultural practices in the village.

These specifics help to create unique and complex individuals in the story. Li Mei is not just any young woman with dreams; she is the one who reads about faraway places and has a charm bracelet from her mother. Li Jilai is not just any village leader; he is the one who wears worn-out shoes and listens to the radio to help improve the village's agricultural practices.

By providing specific details about the characters' lives, preferences, and challenges, we create a rich, engaging narrative that helps the audience connect with the characters and their story. This principle applies to both naturalistic plays and more abstract works, as revealing characters through what they say and what is said about them remains crucial in creating memorable, relatable, and multidimensional characters.

user: Please apply this method to Li Mei's story.

Exercise 56 More facts about the character

Participants: All groups, individual

Take a play that is more abstract in form, in which the characters do not seem as ‘nailed down’ in terms of social status, economic situation, emo- tional state, etc. I have used Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett, but any text that is non-naturalistic will do. Apply the same method. What hard facts about the character does the text reveal?

assistant: For this exercise, we will apply the method to Li Mei's story while giving it a more abstract form. In this version, Li Mei exists in a world where her aspirations and responsibilities are personified as characters, representing her internal struggles.

Characters:

- Li Mei: The protagonist, torn between her dreams and her responsibilities.

- Dream: A personification of Li Mei's aspirations for higher education and a better future.

- Duty: A personification of Li Mei's responsibilities to her family and village.

1. What does Li Mei say about herself?

- She feels conflicted between her dreams and her responsibilities.

- She wishes she could find a balance between the two.

- She sometimes wonders if she is being selfish by wanting more.

2. What does Dream say about Li Mei?

- Li Mei has great potential and a bright future ahead.

- Dream believes that Li Mei deserves the opportunity to explore her aspirations.

- Dream thinks Li Mei can bring positive change to her family and village if she pursues her dreams.

3. What does Duty say about Li Mei?

- Duty understands Li Mei's ambitions but emphasizes the importance of her role in the family and village.

- Duty believes Li Mei can make a difference by staying and helping her community.

- Duty reminds Li Mei of the sacrifices her family has made and the expectations placed upon her.

In this abstract version of Li Mei's story, we still uncover facts about the characters:

- Li Mei is a young woman experiencing internal conflict between her dreams and her responsibilities.

- Dream represents Li Mei's aspirations, highlighting her potential and desire for a better future.

- Duty embodies Li Mei's responsibilities, emphasizing the importance of family and community.

While the narrative takes a more abstract form, the characters' dialogues and interactions still reveal specific details and facts about them, showcasing their unique traits and challenges.

user: Access the outcome in Li Mei and Wu yue's story.  What lessons have we learnt and what improvement we should make to advance the story.

Outcome

In The Seagull and Death of a Salesman, even though some of the ‘facts’ we learn may just be the characters’ opinions of themselves and of each other, they are given within a recognisable social and emotional frame. We do not doubt that Willy is a salesman, and it seems probable that Medvedenko is in love with Masha. On a first read, things seem much less substantial with Estragon and Vladimir. There are enigmatic references to being beaten by unknown people, to having once been respectable, and to access to the Eiffel Tower. Estragon seems the easier character to grasp. He probably spent the night in a ditch, possibly got beaten and is fully preoc- cupied with the boot that hurts. With Vladimir, there seems just to be a lot of random philosophising, particularly around the subject of suffering. In fact, it is exactly here that he is being most concrete for – as we discover – the thing that is hurting him is a painful condition of the bowels. His pre- occupation with such matters of ‘the little things of life’, being ‘relieved and appalled’, and Estragon’s reference to waiting ‘till the last moment’ are all concerned with bowel movements. Underneath the surface of a scene in which the characters seem hugely enigmatic, we have a situation between two characters that is as specific as the ones in The Seagull and Death of a Salesman. We have a man who is desperate to get a painful boot off his foot. We have another man who’s just come back from his ablutions. That was also clearly painful. They quarrel about who suffers most.

In the case of all three plays, we are learning about the characters in specific and detailed ways without realising it.

assistant: Outcome

In Li Mei and Wu Yue's story, we can observe that even though their situation seems less concrete than in The Seagull and Death of a Salesman, their dialogue reveals specific details about their personalities, concerns, and relationships. They face challenges and uncertainties but maintain a strong bond that helps them navigate through their hardships.

Lessons Learned:

1. Characters can be developed through dialogue that reveals their emotions, thoughts, and beliefs.

2. A strong bond between characters can make their relationship relatable and believable, even in less concrete situations.

3. Characters should face challenges and uncertainties to create an engaging and compelling story.

Improvements to Advance the Story:

1. Introduce a clear conflict or goal that Li Mei and Wu Yue need to achieve together, creating a more defined storyline.

2. Develop the characters' backgrounds and histories to add depth and context to their current situation.

3. Introduce other characters or external factors that can further challenge Li Mei and Wu Yue or help them overcome their obstacles.

4. Utilize the characters' unique traits, opinions, and experiences to influence the development of the story.

5. Create moments of tension, resolution, and personal growth for the characters, making their journey more dynamic and engaging.

By incorporating these improvements, Li Mei and Wu Yue's story will become more engaging and compelling, encouraging readers to follow their journey and relate to their struggles and triumphs.

user: rewrite the following and change the 78 yo man to an old tailor of Chinese traditional 旗袍

Example 57.1

This is how the exercise worked for me.

Male, 78, Asian. Taresh. He walks with a limp, smokes a pipe and is bald. He works in a tobacconist’s shop. He lives in a small rented attic- room. It is in a side-street in Sheffield in the UK. He lacks friendship. Right now he needs some more tobacco for his pipe. He secretly steals pipe-tobacco when the shop-owner is out. He has a problem with his back. He remembers the time when he lived by a beach. He believes that his landlord is a murderer. He wishes he could live by the beach again. At this moment he is in the shop alone. He is open- ing the jar with pipe-tobacco in it. He is saying to himself, ‘The woman is a miser anyway, if she paid me well I’d not have to be a thief.’ He reads comic books, he keeps his money under the mattress, and he goes to the opera once a year.

assistant: Example 57.1

This is how the exercise worked for me.

Male, 78, Asian. Taresh. He walks with a limp, smokes a pipe, and is bald. He works as a tailor, specializing in traditional Chinese 旗袍 (Qipao). He lives in a small rented attic-room. It is in a side-street in Shanghai, China. He lacks friendship. Right now, he needs some more fabric for his latest Qipao creation. He secretly uses leftover fabric from his clients' orders to make his own designs. He has a problem with his back. He remembers the time when he lived by a beach. He believes that his landlord is a murderer. He wishes he could live by the beach again. At this moment, he is in his tailor shop alone. He is opening a drawer to take out some fabric scraps. He is saying to himself, 'The woman is a miser anyway, if she paid me well for the rent, I'd not have to be so thrifty.' He reads comic books, he keeps his money under the mattress, and he goes to the opera once a year.

user: Please access the outcome of Li mei, wu yue and old tailor.

Should any improvement to be made, please point out.

assistant: Outcome:

Li Mei: A young, introverted Chinese woman working in the finance industry. She struggles with expressing her emotions and connecting with others, especially her family. She has a secret desire to learn dancing, which she believes could help her express herself better.

Wu Yue: A 28-year-old independent, outgoing, and resilient artist living in Beijing. She earns her money from her artwork and part-time work as an art teacher. Wu Yue stands up for her beliefs and is passionate about social issues. She is currently working on a mural project that highlights environmental concerns.

Old Tailor (Taresh): A 78-year-old Asian man who works as a tailor specializing in traditional Chinese Qipao in Shanghai. He lives in a small rented attic room and lacks friendship. He has a problem with his back and secretly uses leftover fabric from his clients' orders to create his designs. He wishes he could live by the beach again.

Improvements:

1. Li Mei: To enhance Li Mei's character, consider adding more specific memories or experiences that have shaped her personality and worldview. Explore her relationships with her family, friends, and colleagues to create a more detailed background.

2. Wu Yue: Delve deeper into her background, such as her upbringing and the events that led her to become an artist. Additionally, explore her relationships with other characters in the story and how they influence her art and beliefs.

3. Old Tailor (Taresh): Expand on his past experiences, such as why he became a tailor and his life by the beach. Develop his relationships with other characters, such as Li Mei and Wu Yue, to explore how they might affect one another throughout the story.

user: Make the improvement according to the outcome below

Outcome

You have now created a character in some detail. The details range from the physical to the emotional; from the daily to the psychological. Contradic- tions exist within the character. Taresh, the Asian man in the example, could well provide the basis for further development. Someone who justifies petty theft, harbours suspicions about his landlord, longs to live by a beach, and goes to the opera once a year raises many interesting questions.

assistant: Improvement:

Li Mei: Growing up in a strict household, Li Mei struggled to form a close relationship with her parents, who prioritized academic success over emotional connections. This has influenced her introverted nature and difficulty expressing emotions. Her friendship with Wu Yue opens up new opportunities for her to explore her passion for dancing and encourages her to confront her past, including the complicated relationship with her family.

Wu Yue: Wu Yue's passion for art began when she was a child, influenced by her grandmother, a renowned painter. She attended a prestigious art school, where she met like-minded individuals who inspired her to use art as a medium for social change. Her friendship with Li Mei and the Old Tailor expands her understanding of human emotions and brings new dimensions to her work.

Old Tailor (Taresh): Taresh's passion for tailoring started when he was young, learning the craft from his father. He moved to the city to pursue his dreams, but his longing for the beach remained. His chance encounter with Li Mei and Wu Yue brings about a turning point in his life, as he discovers new ways to connect with others and finds solace in sharing his craft with them. The three characters' interactions spark unexpected revelations and inspire personal growth.

In this improved version, the characters have more depth and complex relationships with one another. Their backgrounds and experiences provide a strong foundation for the story, allowing for a richer exploration of their lives, emotions, and personal growth.

user: Do the exercise in Li Mei's story

Exercise 60 Practical research

Participants: All groups, individual

The last exercise may now suggest you do some practical research. There will be aspects of your character’s life that may be unfamiliar to you, and so some detailed practical knowledge could shift the development further.

assistant: In order to conduct practical research for Li Mei's story, you can explore the following aspects of her life and the world she inhabits:

1. Chinese Calligraphy: As Li Mei is a calligraphy teacher, learn more about the history and techniques of Chinese calligraphy. Study the different styles and understand the cultural significance of calligraphy in China.

2. Life in a Chinese village: Research daily life in a Chinese village, focusing on customs, traditions, and the social structure. This will provide a better understanding of Li Mei's background and upbringing.

3. The Chinese art scene: Investigate contemporary Chinese art and the role of artists like Wu Yue. Learn about popular themes, styles, and the influence of traditional Chinese art on contemporary works.

4. Chinese traditional clothing, particularly 旗袍: Research the history, significance, and making process of 旗袍 (qipao). This will help you better understand the old tailor's profession and his role in the story.

5. LGBTQ+ community in China: Although we omitted the LGBTQ+ aspect in Wu Yue's bio, it is still important to understand the social and cultural context of LGBTQ+ issues in China for a well-rounded view of the story.

6. Chinese tea culture: Tea plays a significant role in Chinese culture. Learn about different types of Chinese tea, tea ceremonies, and the social aspects of tea-drinking.

Once you have researched these topics, you will have a richer understanding of Li Mei's world and the context in which the characters live. This practical knowledge will help you create a more immersive and authentic story.

user: Access the outcome

Outcome

Now you will have gathered further raw material from which to draw. With the example, we could now see Taresh in his current environment and have a range of choices regarding the beach he dreams of. We would have a range of operas and comic books to consider. Murders in seedy attic-rooms suggest themselves.

assistant: Outcome:

After conducting practical research for Li Mei's story, you now have more raw material to create a richer narrative. The detailed understanding of Chinese calligraphy, village life, the art scene, traditional clothing, and tea culture will help you bring Li Mei's world to life. Additionally, exploring the various aspects of her life and the lives of other characters, such as Wu Yue and the old tailor, will provide a range of choices for the characters' interactions, emotions, and experiences.

The knowledge of Chinese tea culture, for instance, could lead to a scene where Li Mei and Wu Yue bond over a tea ceremony. The exploration of 旗袍 and the old tailor's profession might inspire a subplot involving the tailor and his craftsmanship. The LGBTQ+ context in China, though not a central theme for Wu Yue, can still help you create more authentic and nuanced relationships and challenges for the characters.

By gathering this raw material, you will be better equipped to create an engaging, immersive, and culturally rich story that resonates with readers.

user: Exercise 61 What’s in a name?

Participants: All groups, individual

Your character has a name Li Mei. Use Exercise 22 in Chapter 1 to discover what their name reveals about them.

assistant: Exercise 22 in Chapter 1 explores how a name can reveal information about a character, taking into account the name's meaning, cultural background, and associations. Let's examine Li Mei's name:

Li Mei (李梅) is a Chinese name composed of two characters:

1. Li (李): This is a common Chinese surname, which means "plum" or "plum tree." It is one of the most widespread surnames in China and has a long history. This surname could imply that Li Mei comes from a traditional Chinese family or has deep roots in Chinese culture.

2. Mei (梅): This character means "plum blossom" and is often used as a female given name. Plum blossoms are admired in Chinese culture for their resilience, as they bloom in the cold winter months. This name could suggest that Li Mei is a strong, resilient, and graceful individual.

Based on the meaning and cultural background of Li Mei's name, we can infer that she might have a strong connection to Chinese culture and tradition. She could be a resilient, graceful, and tenacious character, much like the plum blossoms her name represents.

Considering this information, you can explore Li Mei's character further by examining how her name's meaning and associations may influence her actions, relationships, and development throughout the story.

Exercise 62 Murdering babies

Participants: All groups, individual

Through the exercises above, you have created and gathered your raw material. You have a recognisable and distinct character, with thoughts, feel- ings, flaws and some history. There will be more to come, but now is the time to consider which elements are to be (a) retained, (b) given prominence and (c) abandoned. This is perhaps a good moment to note the following: decisions made now can be reversed later, if that suits your purposes. I don’t know why exactly, but I have noted in some writers I have worked with, and myself, that there can be a tendency to hang onto something just because

‘it’s there’. I know that I have ruined plays of my own by refusing to dispense with a character who I liked, but who was not at all necessary; or a scene that made me chuckle, but which added nothing at all to the dynamic of the plot. So don’t be afraid to throw overboard anything which seems untrue or irrel- evant at the moment. If they really are necessary, they will find their way back. You will be surprised when a character you scrapped in Draft Two of your play suddenly pops up in Draft Four. A piece of advice I was given once, regarding getting over-fond of passages the play can do without, was ‘we have to learn to murder our babies’. Sometimes a character becomes very dear to us; so dear in fact, that even when we know they are not helping the play at all, we can’t bear to dismiss them. So, starting from now, see if there are any babies to be killed off.

That said, don’t throw the birth certificate out with the baby. Keep all your notes on the character. File the profiles on cards and retain them. The baby may need to be brought back to life at a later date.

Go through the work on your character. Be as rigorous with yourself as possible. Don’t hang on to anything if you cannot justify its inclusion.

1	What aspects of the character should be developed?

2	What aspects should be disposed of?

3	Are there any new aspects that suggest themselves?

4	What possibilities for story development are suggested? Explore three or four options. Try different groupings of information about the character. (See Examples 62.1.)

5	Choose one.

assistant: 1. What aspects of the character should be developed?

- Li Mei's passion for environmental activism and her commitment to making a difference

- The relationship between Li Mei and her grandmother, exploring how it shapes Li Mei's personality and values

- Li Mei's struggles in balancing her activism with her personal life, friendships, and love interests

2. What aspects should be disposed of?

- Li Mei's hobby of collecting stamps, as it doesn't seem to contribute to her overall character development or the story

- The subplot about Li Mei's temporary job at a fast-food restaurant, unless it connects to her activism or personal growth

3. Are there any new aspects that suggest themselves?

- Li Mei could encounter a mentor or role model within the environmental movement, someone who challenges her to grow and take on greater responsibility

- Li Mei might face a moral dilemma, such as choosing between her activism and a personal relationship or opportunity

4. What possibilities for story development are suggested? Explore three or four options.

Option 1: Li Mei leads a local environmental campaign that gains national attention, thrusting her into the public eye and testing her resilience

Option 2: Li Mei discovers that her grandmother's past is connected to an environmental issue, prompting her to investigate and confront family secrets

Option 3: Li Mei's activism puts her in conflict with powerful interests, forcing her to navigate a dangerous and high-stakes situation

Option 4: Li Mei's personal life becomes intertwined with her activism, as she falls in love with someone whose beliefs or actions conflict with her own values

5. Choose one.

Option 3: Li Mei's activism puts her in conflict with powerful interests, forcing her to navigate a dangerous and high-stakes situation. This option allows for a compelling story that explores Li Mei's character development, the challenges she faces in her activism, and the impact of her choices on her personal life and relationships.

user: Adapt this to Li Mei's story.

Examples 62.1

With Taresh and the possible development of his character, and a story for him, I came up with the following options.

Option (a): Murder (or suspected murder) and petty theft are both on the menu. The murder option is very high-level on the plot-development scale. To go down that route right now might close doors on a more mun- dane – but possibly more interesting – investigation into the character of Taresh. On the other hand, petty theft from his employer (and possibly the only other person working in the shop, someone who Taresh would have daily contact and a personal relationship with) could throw more light on his character.

Option (b): A 78-year old Asian man who reads comics and goes to the opera once a year marks Taresh out as different from the next 78-year old Asian man. Perhaps an exploration of just one of these personal interests

might be enough to give an insight into who Taresh is. I would suggest  that the opera-option might give greater scope, given that ‘going to the opera’ is a social event, while reading comics is a solitary one. Given that a play (even if it is a monologue) is about social interaction of some sort,    I would suggest that the opera be given prominence and the comics take a bit of a back-seat as character-detail.

Option (c): Taresh obviously has money problems – lives in a rented accommodation, can’t afford to buy the tobacco he sells, seems not to be able to live near the beach he once lived by, goes to the opera only once a year. Yet he has money under the mattress, he buys comics, he does manage to buy an opera ticket once a year. I would suggest that all of this should be retained and developed: the complexities and contradictions of life – in fiction and in reality – are essentially bound up with those of mate- rial existence. Refer to previous work in this chapter, where we discovered essential things about Masha and Willy through mention of economic circumstances.

assistant: Examples 62.1

With Li Mei and the possible development of her character and story, I came up with the following options.

Option (a): Environmental activism and personal relationships are both essential aspects of Li Mei's life. The environmental activism option provides a significant plot development and allows exploration of Li Mei's dedication and courage. On the other hand, her personal relationships, particularly her connection with her grandmother, provide a more intimate insight into her character and motivations.

Option (b): A young environmental activist who is passionate about her cause and yet struggles to balance her personal life marks Li Mei as a complex and relatable character. Perhaps an exploration of her environmental activism or her personal relationships might provide valuable insight into Li Mei's character. The environmental activism option has broader scope, involving social interactions and potential conflicts. Meanwhile, her personal relationships, especially with her grandmother, offer a more intimate look into her background and values.

Option (c): Li Mei's dedication to her cause and the sacrifices she makes for it reveal her complexity and resilience. Despite facing challenges, she continues to fight for what she believes in. However, this commitment comes at a cost, as Li Mei struggles to balance her activism with her personal life and relationships. All of these aspects should be retained and developed, as they highlight the contradictions and complexities of Li Mei's life. These elements help create a multifaceted character that the audience can connect with and understand on a deeper level.

Based on these options, a combination of Option (a) and Option (b) might be the best way to develop Li Mei's story. By focusing on her environmental activism and personal relationships, particularly her bond with her grandmother, the story can delve into both the broader social issues that Li Mei is passionate about and the intimate connections that shape her character. This approach will create a compelling and nuanced narrative that allows the audience to engage with Li Mei's story on multiple levels.

user: Access the outcome.

Outcome

In the different options, you have now murdered some babies, promoted some others and relegated some to second rank. Always remember that they might come back, if needed. What you have now is an outline of a believable character in a believable situation. What you need to do now is to give that character a believable past.

assistant: Outcome

Through the different options, you have successfully refined and focused your character's development by eliminating less relevant aspects, emphasizing key elements, and considering the importance of secondary details. Remember that discarded elements can still be reintroduced later if they prove necessary for the story. Currently, you have a well-rounded and believable character, Li Mei, in a relatable situation. The next step in the process is to create a detailed and engaging backstory for Li Mei, which will further enhance her depth and authenticity as a character.

user: Plan a journey for Li Mei

Exercise 66 The character’s journey

Participants: All groups, individual

Think about the life-story of your character. Chart the progress of the character from their birth up to the present moment – that is, where we meet them at the start of the play. By ‘progress’ I mean ‘journey’. By ‘jour- ney’ I mean both external and internal: physical journey and emotional journey, economic journey and spiritual journey.

1	Have ten blank postcards. Number them. Number 1 is the start of  their journey, number 10 is the moment we meet them in the play.

2	Write on the top of each card a significant event in the character’s life- journey. By events I mean things that were observable and social (left home, won the Oscar, got imprisoned for life, discovered a new  planet, etc.

3	Try to keep the events evenly spread out along the course of their life – like items of washing strung out on a line.

4	The washing line image is useful, in that it will have items of different sizes hanging from it. Some of your events will be huge and bed-sheet-sized (death of a loved one) and others the size of a cush- ion cover (winning a prize at school) or a handkerchief (enjoying a particular film).

5	Under each event, write down the answers to the following:

●	What was the character feeling and thinking at the time?

●	What were the economic circumstances the character was in at the time?

●	Who was the character in contact with at the time?

●	What different choices did the character have/not have at the time?

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

You now have a skeleton-of your character’s life journey. But remember, it is all in developmental stage and babies can still be murdered.

assistant: Outcome

You now have a rough outline of Li Mei's life journey, detailing significant events and the emotions, circumstances, and choices she faced throughout her life. This provides a strong foundation for further character development, helping you understand her past experiences and how they have shaped her present. However, keep in mind that this is still a developmental stage, and some aspects of her story may change or be discarded as you continue to refine her character. Don't hesitate to make adjustments if they better serve the story or character development.

user: Exercise 67 Don’t forget the other characters

Participants: All groups, individual

Other characters will have begun to emerge. They will also need to be as fully rounded as your major character, and some degree of similar work will have to be put into them. Write thumbnail sketches of all the other characters. With other major characters, you will need to examine them   in fuller detail, using methods we have explored.

assistant: For this exercise, let's assume there are four other characters in Li Mei's story: her best friend, her romantic interest, a rival, and a mentor. Here are thumbnail sketches for each:

1. Best Friend - Chen Ying:

Chen Ying is a kind, loyal, and supportive friend to Li Mei. She comes from a stable family and has a bubbly personality. She is always eager to help Li Mei and often provides her with emotional support when needed. They have been friends since childhood and share many memories together. Ying is pursuing a career in graphic design and enjoys art and photography.

2. Romantic Interest - Zhang Wei:

Zhang Wei is a smart, ambitious, and driven individual. He works in the tech industry and has a passion for innovation. He is a bit shy but has a good sense of humor. He shares some common interests with Li Mei, and they have a mutual attraction. As their relationship develops, they face challenges and learn to grow together.

3. Rival - Wang Jia:

Wang Jia is a highly competitive and successful person in Li Mei's professional field. They share a tense relationship, as they often find themselves competing for the same opportunities. Wang Jia is highly skilled and intelligent but can sometimes be arrogant and dismissive. This rivalry pushes Li Mei to work harder and strive for success.

4. Mentor - Professor Liu:

Professor Liu is a wise, experienced, and respected figure in Li Mei's life. He has had a successful career in academia and has been a guiding force for Li Mei since her college days. He provides Li Mei with advice, encouragement, and guidance as she navigates her personal and professional life.

For the major characters, you can use the methods explored in previous exercises to develop them further, such as examining their backgrounds, motivations, and emotional journeys.

user: Exercise 68 The back-story

Participants: All groups, individual

You are soon going to write a full life-history of your character, based upon everything you have done so far; but before that, there are some things I would like you to consider.

What you have begun to do, through these exercises, is to create what film- makers term the ‘back-story’ of your character(s) – quite literally, ‘the story behind the story’. That is, all the elements of the life of the character(s).

It would be worth taking a moment to think about what exactly ‘back- story’ means, and how it can help us enormously with the character(s) we are creating (and later – as we shall see in Chapter 5 – the development of narrative). I have used the phrase ‘raw material’ a couple of times, and that is just what it is. If we are going to create characters who are absolutely unique, who are not stereotypes, then we need to know them in all their detail. Already we know that Taresh in the example is not just any Asian working in a shop in the UK city of Sheffield. The characters you are building will also emerge as unique in their own rights. So is ‘back-story’ a random selection of events, memories, feelings, etc.; or can it be seen as a more systematic look at our character? I suggest that when you come to review all the work you have put into developing the char- acter, all of the following categories should have been touched upon:

●	The inner world of the character: those things that happen in the heart, the head and the soul. The thoughts, dreams, feelings, ambi- tions, fears . . . (continue the list).

●	The immediate, intimate outer world of the character: the nurturers, the lovers, the friendships, the familial . . . (continue the list).

●	The wider social world of the character: the teachers, colleagues, shopkeepers . . . (continue the list).

●	The institutional world the character might come into contact with: relations with employers, police, the professions, religious bodies . . . (continue the list).

●	The specific places and times that the character inhabits.

assistant: For Li Mei, let's consider each category of her back-story:

1. The inner world of Li Mei:

Li Mei is a determined and hardworking individual, striving to achieve her professional goals. She often daydreams about her future success and the impact she could make in her field. She is compassionate and empathetic, but also has a fear of failure and rejection. She values her personal relationships and is searching for love and connection. Her hobbies and interests include reading, painting, and exploring nature.

2. The immediate, intimate outer world of Li Mei:

Li Mei's family is supportive, but they also have high expectations for her success. She has a strong bond with her best friend, Chen Ying, who is always there for her. Li Mei's relationship with her romantic interest, Zhang Wei, is growing and evolving as they learn more about each other. Her relationship with her parents is loving but sometimes strained due to their expectations.

3. The wider social world of Li Mei:

Li Mei has a network of professional colleagues, acquaintances, and mentors, like Professor Liu, who have influenced her career and personal development. She has had both positive and negative experiences with her peers, such as her rivalry with Wang Jia. She also interacts with various people in her daily life, including her neighbors, local shopkeepers, and other community members.

4. The institutional world Li Mei comes into contact with:

Li Mei has had experiences with different institutions, such as her university, where she studied and built connections with professors and classmates. She has dealt with various employers and colleagues throughout her professional life. Li Mei has had limited interactions with law enforcement, mainly for minor traffic incidents. She occasionally attends cultural and religious events, connecting with her heritage and community.

5. The specific places and times that Li Mei inhabits:

Li Mei was born and raised in a medium-sized city in China. She completed her education and started her career there before moving to a larger city for better opportunities. The story takes place in the present day, and her experiences are shaped by the social, cultural, and economic context of her environment.

As you review the work you've done on developing Li Mei's character, ensure that you've touched upon each of these categories to create a well-rounded and unique individual.

user: Now go back over all the material you have written and researched. Write out the character’s back-story, eliminating those things that no longer seem to fit and adding new things as they suggest themselves. Following on from the previous notes, try not to go for just the ‘externals’ (‘she did this and then she did that’) but allow the inner life to emerge, explore what the character is thinking and feeling. While you are doing this, keep the following in mind:

●	Don’t go for the obviously ‘dramatic’ just for the sake of it. Guns, baby-eating, and grandmothers-under-the floorboards may finally be essential to the story, but if they are forced onto the story you could end up with an all-action, no-character melodrama.

●	Is what you are inventing true to the nature of your character? People do change, of course – and plays are essentially about watching how people do or do not change – but if your sweet-tempered, humanistic character suddenly becomes a raging fascist we will need to see very clearly how and why that happens. There is a play called Good by

a writer called C.P. Taylor, in which a humanist university lecturer in Germany in the 1930s eventually becomes a commandant of a concen- tration camp. As a study of the journey from light to dark in a human soul, and how the dramatist charts that journey, it is well worth a look at. It is an excellent example of a play that asks us what we would do, if we found ourselves in a similar situation: would we take the same path?

●	Coincidence does happen in life, but be sparing with it in the life of your character. If a ‘good angel’ turns up once, when your character is in a spot of trouble, that may be fine; but if they keep turning up whenever there is a difficulty they will lose credibility.

●	You may find that you are writing a very fine short story. Good. You may be a fine short-story writer as well as a playwright.

assistant: Li Mei's Back-story:

Li Mei was born in a medium-sized city in China, to a loving and supportive family. Her parents always had high expectations for her, which led her to work hard to excel academically. During her childhood, Li Mei found solace in painting, reading, and exploring nature, which also allowed her to develop a strong connection to her cultural heritage. As she grew up, she formed a close friendship with Chen Ying, a bond that would continue to support her throughout her life.

As Li Mei entered university, she dedicated herself to her studies, pursuing a degree in a field that would allow her to make a difference in the world. Her relationship with her parents grew strained at times due to their high expectations and her own fear of failure, but she remained committed to her goals. During her time in university, she met Professor Liu, who became her mentor and helped her navigate her academic and professional life.

After graduating, Li Mei moved to a larger city to pursue better career opportunities. While adjusting to her new environment, she continued to explore her interests and engaged with her community by attending cultural and religious events. Li Mei's career began to take shape, and she started building a network of colleagues and acquaintances. However, she also faced challenges and competition, particularly with her rival, Wang Jia.

Li Mei's love life took a turn for the better when she met Zhang Wei, who shared her interests and passions. As their relationship evolved, they faced obstacles and learned more about each other, bringing them closer together. Throughout her life, Li Mei has navigated various institutions, from her university to her workplace, experiencing both successes and setbacks.

In the present day, Li Mei has established herself as a determined and compassionate individual who values her personal relationships and strives to achieve her goals. Despite the challenges she faces, Li Mei remains true to herself and her beliefs, continually seeking love, connection, and the chance to make a difference in the world.

As you continue to develop Li Mei's story, keep in mind the balance between dramatic and realistic events, the authenticity of her character development, and the use of coincidence sparingly. By doing so, you will create a believable and engaging character whose journey will captivate and resonate with your audience.

Outcome

You have now created a full world and a full life for your character. Some of these things will be fully in the play, some of them only alluded to. All of them will inform your knowledge of the character and the journey they are on.

assistant: You have successfully developed Li Mei's back-story, creating a well-rounded character with a rich history and experiences that have shaped her into the person she is in the present day. By considering her inner thoughts, feelings, and personal connections, you have given her depth and complexity, which will enable her to engage with the audience on a deeper level.

Moreover, you have touched upon various aspects of her life, including her family, education, career, relationships, and encounters with different institutions. This comprehensive approach to character development has allowed you to create a believable and unique individual whose journey is both interesting and relatable.

As you move forward with your play, keep in mind that all the elements of Li Mei's back-story will help inform her actions, decisions, and interactions with other characters. This understanding of her past and present will be invaluable as you weave her story into the broader narrative of your play, ultimately bringing her to life on stage.

Exercise 69 An opening moment or scene

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Choose a moment in the life of your character with which to open     the play.

2	Include at least two characters. Don’t bring in peripheral characters unless absolutely necessary.

3	Go for something low-key, but with suggestions and hints of conflicts and tensions beneath the surface. Think of Masha’s indifference to her suitor, and Willy’s concern about his son.

4	Bring something in to mark it as different from all the other days – on this day, Medvedenko, the daily suitor, asks Masha why she always wears black; on this day Willy fails to make the work-journey.

5	Try for a scene of some length, 200–300 words. Don’t worry if it doesn’t complete itself, focus on getting the characters talking.

assistant: Opening Scene for Li Mei

Characters:

- Li Mei

- Chen, her best friend

Setting: Li Mei's small apartment in the city, early morning.

(Scene begins with Li Mei sitting at the small kitchen table, sipping a cup of tea. She appears to be deep in thought, with an anxious expression on her face. Chen enters the room, rubbing sleep from her eyes.)

Chen: (Yawning) Good morning, Li Mei. You're up early. What's on your mind?

Li Mei: (Sighs) Morning, Chen. I just couldn't sleep. Today's the day I'm finally going to confront my boss about that promotion.

Chen: (Sits down at the table) Ah, I see. You've been talking about it for months now. Are you feeling ready?

Li Mei: (Nervously) I think so. I've been preparing my argument, and I know I deserve it, but I can't help feeling anxious. You know how our boss can be...

Chen: (Nods) Yeah, he can be quite intimidating. But Li Mei, remember how hard you've worked for this. You've proven yourself time and time again. You can do this.

Li Mei: (Smiles weakly) Thanks, Chen. Your support means a lot to me.

Chen: (Leans in, curious) So, what's your plan? Are you going to talk to him during lunch or after work?

Li Mei: (Takes a deep breath) I think I'll do it during lunch. That way, I won't have to stress about it all day. I just hope he listens and gives me a fair chance.

Chen: (Reassuringly) He will, Li Mei. And if he doesn't, you know there are other opportunities out there for you. But I have a feeling he'll see your worth.

Li Mei: (Feeling more determined) You're right. I need to stay positive and focused. Thank you, Chen.

Chen: (Smiles) You got this, Li Mei. Now, let's get ready for the day.

(They both stand up and start their morning routine, the tension slowly dissipating as they prepare for the challenges ahead.)

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

You will now have created an opening moment for your play, in which you will have begun to reveal your character or characters. That is they are ready to be set in motion. Of course, they are already alive and active and some of their inner contradictions and outer problems have been revealed; but in terms of a dramatic narrative nothing much has happened. As we shall see, real ‘character’ is only revealed when the individual is put under pressure; that is, when events conspire to force them to make choices.

assistant: In this outcome, you have successfully created an opening moment for your play, where Li Mei and Chen are introduced. The scene sets the tone for Li Mei's emotional state and the challenges she is facing. The dialogue between the characters highlights their relationship and the supportive nature of Chen.

This opening moment lays the groundwork for the development of the characters and the story. As the play progresses, Li Mei will be put under pressure, forcing her to make choices that reveal her true character. The scene effectively sets the stage for the forthcoming events and creates anticipation for the audience, eager to see how Li Mei's journey unfolds.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. SETTING THE CHARACTERS IN MOTION

In the previous exercises you created a character with a rich history, alongside other characters with their own individuality. Conflicts (social, personal, moral, etc.) and key events were referred to or suggested. You also created an opening scene that introduced two of the characters. Before we proceed, you may need to do some more work on that scene.

assistant: Setting the characters in motion is a vital part of crafting a play or story. This process involves creating situations and conflicts that challenge the characters, causing them to evolve and react. By placing characters in such situations, you reveal their true nature, desires, and motivations, which makes them more engaging and relatable to the audience.

To further illustrate this concept, let's consider the following example:

Suppose Li Mei, the main character of your play, is a talented artist struggling to make a living. Chen, her supportive best friend, helps her navigate the challenges of pursuing her passion. In the opening scene, we learn about their close relationship, Li Mei's financial struggles, and her dream of becoming a successful artist.

To set the characters in motion, you can introduce a conflict or a turning point. For example, Li Mei receives an offer to work on a lucrative advertising project that goes against her artistic values. This event puts her in a dilemma: should she prioritize her financial security or her artistic integrity?

As the story progresses, we witness how Li Mei and Chen react to this situation. Chen might encourage Li Mei to take the project for the sake of financial stability, revealing his practical nature. On the other hand, Li Mei might wrestle with the decision, showcasing her internal conflict between her passion and her needs. This turning point serves as a catalyst for the characters' growth and the unfolding of the story.

To strengthen the opening scene, you can:

1. Refine the dialogue: Make sure the conversation between Li Mei and Chen feels natural and engaging while still revealing essential information about their characters.

2. Enhance the setting: Establish the environment in which the characters exist, making it more vivid and immersive for the audience.

3. Introduce subplots or secondary conflicts: You can hint at other challenges or issues that Li Mei and Chen face in their lives, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.

By setting the characters in motion, you ensure that your play or story is dynamic, engaging, and thought-provoking. The conflicts and situations you introduce should challenge the characters and reveal their true selves, ultimately making for a compelling and immersive experience for the audience.

user: Exercise 70 Rewriting the opening scene

Participants: All groups, individual

Look at your opening scene. Ask yourself the following questions and see if they prompt you to sharpen the scene up a little.

1	Does it contain a dilemma, a source of tension, a hint of things to come for the character(s)?

2	Does it give a sense of the intentions or ‘wants’ or ‘needs’ (conscious or unconscious) of the character(s)?

3	Does it give rise to (perhaps subconscious) questions in the mind of the audience?

4	Rewrite the scene.

assistant: Please apply this exercise to the previously mentioned opening scene with Li Mei and Chen.

In the original opening scene, we learned about Li Mei's financial struggles, her dream of becoming a successful artist, and her close relationship with her best friend, Chen. To apply the exercise, let's address each question one by one and then rewrite the scene accordingly:

1. Does it contain a dilemma, a source of tension, a hint of things to come for the character(s)?

The original scene briefly touched on Li Mei's financial struggles and her dream. To enhance this, we can introduce the lucrative advertising project offer that challenges her artistic values.

2. Does it give a sense of the intentions or 'wants' or 'needs' (conscious or unconscious) of the character(s)?

We can emphasize Li Mei's need for financial security and her desire to stay true to her artistic principles. Additionally, we can show Chen's practical approach to life and his concern for Li Mei's well-being.

3. Does it give rise to (perhaps subconscious) questions in the mind of the audience?

The rewritten scene should provoke questions such as: Will Li Mei accept the advertising project? What will be the consequences of her decision? How will Chen's opinion affect Li Mei's choice?

Rewritten scene:

INT. LI MEI'S APARTMENT - DAY

Li Mei sits at her easel, working on a painting. Chen enters the room, waving an envelope.

CHEN: You won't believe it, Li Mei! You've got an offer to work on a huge advertising campaign!

LI MEI: (surprised) Really? That could help with my financial troubles, but...

She hesitates, looking back at her unfinished painting.

LI MEI: (continued) I'm not sure I want to compromise my art for commercial projects.

CHEN: I understand your concerns, but think about the opportunities this could bring. You can always return to your personal art after securing your financial future.

Li Mei looks conflicted, considering the impact of her decision.

In this revised opening scene, we have introduced a dilemma, provided insights into the characters' intentions and needs, and raised questions in the audience's mind, which sets the stage for the unfolding narrative.

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

Any opening scene will contain some of these – or similar – elements. You have now begun to ask yourself ‘what do the characters’ want? When we have discovered what their real wants, needs and desires are, we will begin to know what their real drives are. And then we will have fully set them in motion.

assistant: With the rewritten opening scene, you have successfully incorporated important elements that contribute to an engaging start. By exploring the characters' wants, needs, and desires, you have laid the foundation for the motivations that will drive Li Mei and Chen throughout the story. The scene now not only introduces the characters but also presents a dilemma and conflict that will keep the audience intrigued. As the characters' desires and drives are revealed, they are set in motion, ready to face the challenges and make choices that will shape the narrative.

user: do the exercise in the context of Li mei's story.

Exercise 71 The drives of the character

Participants: All groups, individual

You will soon be looking at (a) how you set your character(s) fully in motion and (b) what their drives really are. Before that, there are some points we need to consider. Some of them will be familiar, but they are worth going over again. I am going to illustrate them by referring to two example-narratives: Macbeth and Little Red Riding Hood.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's explore her drives and motivations, as well as those of other key characters in her narrative.

1. Li Mei: Her primary drive is to achieve success and make her family proud. As a talented dancer who struggled to obtain a scholarship, she's determined to prove herself in the world of traditional Chinese dance. Additionally, she wants to preserve her cultural heritage and inspire others with her art.

2. Chen: Chen, a renowned choreographer and mentor, has a passion for nurturing young talents and pushing them to their fullest potential. His drive is to discover and hone the next generation of dancers, ensuring the preservation of traditional Chinese dance. Through working with Li Mei, he finds a renewed sense of purpose.

3. Li Mei's parents: Their main drive is to provide the best possible life for their daughter, supporting her dreams and aspirations. They believe in her talent and want her to succeed in her chosen career, despite the challenges and sacrifices they face as a family.

4. Rival dancer: This character is driven by ambition and jealousy, which pushes her to compete with Li Mei for the lead role in an upcoming performance. She wants to prove herself as the best dancer and secure her place in the spotlight, even if it means resorting to underhanded tactics.

By examining the drives and motivations of these characters, we can better understand how their desires will propel the story forward and create engaging, dynamic relationships among them. Li Mei's pursuit of success, Chen's passion for nurturing talent, the parents' support, and the rival dancer's ambition all contribute to the narrative's conflict and development, setting the characters in motion.

user: adapt macbeth to Li Mei' story

Example 71.1 Macbeth

As a general principle, nothing very much happens when we first meet our main character(s). Potential sources of dramatic conflict may be sug- gested, outlines of future problems may be raised, and questions left unanswered may be posed. We do not even have to meet our main char- acter(s) in the first scene: Macbeth does not appear until Scene 3, Act 1. But the point is that (as a general principle) we encounter the main char- acter(s) in quite an ordinary way. By ‘ordinary’, I mean ordinary in terms

of the world they live in. In Macbeth’s world, the ordinary is that of feudal loyalties and terrible battles (just as in Willy’s it is of the daily slog-to-work of the travelling salesman). All of this is part of the exposition, which we will be looking at in more detail later on.

As a general principle, the function of the first encounter with our main character(s) is to:

●	Allow us to observe the status quo: the life of the characters as it generally is, the way they are regarded or regard themselves and the others around them. Feudal duties as a loyal general (Macbeth), or the daily slog-to-work as a faithful employee (Willy). That is who they are, that is what they do, and that is how they go about it.

●	Indicate to us that this particular day is marked out as slightly – or even more than slightly – different from all the others; although not so dif- ferent as to change the status quo. Let us see what happens when we first meet Macbeth. He has already been set up as a good and loyal servant of the king; ‘brave Macbeth – well he deserves that name’; ‘O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!’; ‘noble Macbeth’. In the next scene, Macbeth is riding back from battle, which we assume is his ver- sion of ‘the daily routine’, when he meets three witches who tell him that (a) he’ll soon be thane of Cawdor and (b) after that he’ll get to be king. Macbeth is a bit puzzled by all this and asks them how they know all these things, but they disappear without letting on. Very quickly someone else arrives from the king, saying that the traitorous thane of Cawdor has been executed and that he – Macbeth – has been given the title. This is big news for Macbeth, given what the witches had said. He even allows himself to ponder on the possibility of being king, but puts aside the thought of having to do anything dishonourable to achieve it, in the hope that it will ‘just happen’: ‘If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, Without my stir.’

So, although some dramatic things have been said, nothing has upset the status quo. We know that Macbeth has allowed himself to entertain the idea of being king, but we know that he’s just going to let things take their course. In terms of his wants or needs or desires we gather he desires to live up to his name (valiant, worthy, noble); but we’ve heard him consider (even though he’s dismissed the thought) the possibility of dark deeds. So he’s got ambition. The question that prompts it: which will win out, loyalty or ambition?

What the play is heading for is the moment when the balance is tipped: where Macbeth, by what he does (or, to be more precise, what he does not do), takes the first conscious step down the slippery path. This will be

the event that makes the play possible. There are various terms for this. Film-makers call it the Inciting Incident (the moment that literally kick- starts the character into the action that will carry them through the play).    I tend to use The First Major Turning Point. A nine-year old in a primary school, when I was talking about things that make stories work, called it The Big Bit, which I rather like.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we can adapt the principles from Macbeth to introduce her character and set the stage for the narrative. To do so, we should:

1. Establish the status quo: Li Mei is a talented dancer who has just received a scholarship to study traditional Chinese dance at a prestigious school. She works hard to perfect her craft and is dedicated to preserving her cultural heritage. Her daily life revolves around practice, attending classes, and dealing with the challenges that come with pursuing her passion.

2. Indicate that this particular day is different: On her way to the dance school, Li Mei encounters an elderly woman who tells her that she is destined for great success in the world of traditional Chinese dance, and that she will face a significant challenge that will test her integrity and dedication to her art. Li Mei is intrigued by this encounter but doesn't take it too seriously, believing it to be a strange coincidence.

3. Introduce a question or conflict: As Li Mei continues to excel in her dance classes, she starts to ponder the possibility of achieving great success and fame in her career. However, she's also aware of the potential sacrifices she may have to make along the way, such as betraying her principles or compromising her art. The question arises: which will win out, integrity and dedication to the art or the desire for fame and success?

As the story progresses, Li Mei's narrative will approach a major turning point or "The Big Bit," where she must confront the challenge foretold by the elderly woman. This event will force Li Mei to make a choice that will shape the rest of her journey and test her character, ultimately revealing her true priorities and desires.

user: continue this exercise in the context of li mei

So how does the Major Turning Point work? In Macbeth, for me, it is at the very end of Act 1, Scene 5. The king is coming to stay the night in Macbeth’s castle. We’ve already overheard Lady Macbeth – having learned of what the witches had foretold – decide that her husband has got to seize the moment. The final exchange in the scene is a brilliant example of the kick-start moment.

Macbeth: My dearest love. Duncan comes here  tonight.

Lady Macbeth: And when goes hence? Macbeth: Tomorrow, as he purposes. Lady Macbeth: O, never

Shall sun that morrow see!

She then goes on to make it very clear that the only way Duncan is getting out of the castle is feet first. And what does Macbeth say? He says, ‘We will speak further.’ He doesn’t say, ‘I’m a good and loyal general, we’ll have none of that talk.’ He doesn’t say, ‘I’ve thought about that, but we’ll just leave things to chance.’ He says, ‘We will speak further.’ Then they leave. He’s taken the first, conscious step, down the primrose path to hell. The status quo has shifted. Macbeth’s twin (and conflicting) drives – wanting to be ‘good’ and wanting be ‘great’ – are at war within him. The latter has won out; he has made a conscious choice and the main action of the play is underway.

As a general principle, this First Major Turning Point can be characterised as:

●	Having it’s equivalent in all dramatic narratives.

●	Happening somewhere not too far from the start of the play.

●	Being something that the main characters are conscious of.

●	Changing the status quo.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the First Major Turning Point can be depicted as follows:

Li Mei has been performing exceptionally well at the dance school, earning praise from her instructors and admiration from her peers. One day, a famous dance company's director visits the school to scout for new talents. After watching Li Mei perform, the director offers her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join their prestigious company, a decision that would skyrocket her to fame and success.

However, there's a catch: the director wants Li Mei to modify her traditional Chinese dance style to appeal to a more mainstream, international audience. This would involve incorporating more modern, westernized elements into her performances and potentially compromising the cultural integrity of her art.

The First Major Turning Point in Li Mei's story occurs when she is faced with this life-altering decision:

1. Li Mei could accept the offer, which would mean sacrificing her principles and the authenticity of her traditional dance style for the sake of fame and success. This would lead her down a path of personal conflict and potential regret.

2. Alternatively, Li Mei could reject the offer, choosing to remain true to her art and cultural heritage. This decision would maintain her integrity but might cost her the opportunity to achieve great success and recognition in the dance world.

At this crucial moment, Li Mei's conflicting drives - her desire to preserve and honor her cultural heritage and her ambition for fame and success - are at war within her. The choice she makes at this turning point will shift the status quo and propel her character's journey throughout the rest of the story.

user: adapt this to Li Mei's story

Example 71.2 Little Red Riding Hood

Macbeth is a grand, complex work. At the other end of the scale, the story of Little Red Riding hood is a relatively simple one, but one which teaches us as much about how story and character are inextricably linked. I have used Little Red frequently with groups of very young writers, but I also

recommend it – and other folk/fairy tales – as a useful guide for anyone interested in developing a dramatic narrative.

Applying some of the things we’ve looked at earlier, let’s see what we know about Little Red at the start of the story.

●	She lives with her mother on the edge of a wood.

●	Her grandmother lives by herself on the other side of the wood.

●	Her grandmother is ill in bed.

●	Her mother gives her a basket of food to take to her grandmother.

●	Her mother makes her promise not to stray from the path, but to go straight through the wood.

That’s all straightforward: small, obedient child given task to do by mother. And of course, the First Major Turning Point to the status quo is the moment when Little Red, tripping merrily through the forest with her basket of food, sees some flowers by the side of the path and wanders off into the woods to pick them. If Macbeth’s action was to not tell Lady Macbeth that there’ll be no talk of murder under his roof, Little Red’s action is to disobey her mother’s wishes and please herself. I think the interesting part of her action is the pleasing of herself. Generally the tale is held up as a little moral, telling young people that wolves will get them if they disobey the adults. It becomes a much more interesting story if it is seen as a rite-of-passage: that necessary time in the life of any young person when the inner instincts come into conflict with the world of adult authority. So, far from this being simply a naughty child soon to get her come-uppance, we begin to see someone whose drives are a conflict between what she wants (to be obedient) and what she needs (to follow her desires). We can go further and say that this is a conflict between her conscious want (to be obedient) and her unconscious need (to follow her desires). Wolves, granny-eating and axes are a result not just of the con- scious flouting of parental authority; they flow from the unconscious assertion of the libido.

assistant: Example 71.2 Li Mei's Story Adaptation

Li Mei's story can be adapted similarly to Little Red Riding Hood, focusing on the conflict between her conscious desire to please her family and her unconscious need to pursue her ambitions.

In this adaptation:

● Li Mei lives in a traditional Chinese family who highly values their cultural heritage.

● Her family is proud of her dedication to traditional Chinese dance and supports her education at a prestigious dance school.

● Li Mei receives the offer to join a famous dance company, which her family encourages her to accept.

● However, Li Mei learns that the company wants her to westernize her dance style, which goes against her family's values and her own cultural identity.

The First Major Turning Point in this adaptation of Li Mei's story occurs when she faces the decision of whether to please her family and herself by sticking to their shared cultural values or to follow her unconscious desire for fame and success in the dance world.

Li Mei's decision to either stay true to her cultural identity or compromise her beliefs for success leads her on a journey where she encounters challenges that test her dedication to her art, her family, and herself. Her drives, like Little Red Riding Hood's, stem from the conflict between her conscious want (to please her family and uphold her cultural identity) and her unconscious need (to pursue fame and success).

This adaptation of Li Mei's story highlights the universal struggle between maintaining cultural identity and pursuing personal ambitions. It also shows how characters' inner conflicts can drive a story forward, resulting in engaging and relatable narratives.

Go back to the character and the opening scene you developed. In the light of everything we have been thinking about, map out the play up to a possible First Major Turning Point. Do this in note form, and feel free to play around with a range of possibilities.

assistant: Exercise 72 Rewrite

Participants: All groups, individual

Character: Li Mei

Opening Scene: Li Mei practices traditional Chinese dance at her dance school while her family and teacher watch her progress.

1. Li Mei's family discusses her future in dance and the importance of preserving their cultural heritage through her art.

2. Li Mei receives an invitation to join a prestigious international dance company, and her family is excited about the opportunity for her.

3. At the dance company, Li Mei discovers that the company wants her to adopt a more Westernized dance style, which she's hesitant to embrace.

4. Li Mei befriends a fellow dancer who's also struggling with the decision to adapt their cultural art form for the company.

5. Li Mei's family visits her at the dance company, and they witness the changes in her dance style. They express their disappointment and concern.

6. Li Mei is torn between staying true to her cultural roots or seizing the opportunity to become a successful dancer.

Possible First Major Turning Point: Li Mei is offered a leading role in the company's next big performance, but it requires her to fully commit to the Westernized dance style. She has to decide whether to accept the role and potentially disappoint her family, or turn it down and possibly lose her chance at fame and success in the dance world.

It may be that the style you are developing for your play is very different from the more classic model. Look at a range of contemporary plays and their opening sequences, scenes or chapters. See how the elements dis- cussed in this chapter are at work. You will find that in a great deal of modern work (Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett onwards) they are far less marked, often seemingly invisible, but it does not mean they are not there. If you have the opportunity to observe actors and a director at the start of the rehearsal, you will discover them asking many of the ques- tions we have addressed in this chapter, even (or perhaps more particu- larly) those with more abstract narratives. If the writer has done the job well, the clues – however sparse – will be there for the actors to unearth.

Take a contemporary play that works in a non-naturalistic, abstract man- ner. Using the methods in this chapter, see how the writer has revealed aspects of the main character.

Example 73.1 Attempts on her Life, by Martin Crimp

The examples of narratives used so far have been very much in the classic mould and style. The play you wish to write may employ a more abstract style. Attempts on her Life seems to obey none of the dramatic principles we have been looking at. The ‘her’ of the title never appears, the world of the play seems utterly fractured, there seems to be no sense of turning points in the action.

The play opens with a collage of eleven separate messages on an answer- machine. They are all for a person called Anne. Through the course of the messages (mostly unnamed callers) a picture of Anne is built up; but it cer- tainly doesn’t give any sense of a ‘well-rounded character’. It is almost as if each caller is speaking to a different person.

Call 1	Anne has been hurt by someone. Call 2	Anne thinks someone is crazy.

Call 3	Anne has to pick up a truck and a ‘device’. Call 4	Anne has a mum.

Call 5	Anne can pick up the truck from the showroom.

Call 6   Anne is a ‘fucking bitch’. Anne will soon be dead for things    she did.

Call 7 Anne has sent a postcard and a (not immediately recognisable) photo of herself to her mum and dad. Anne has asked her mum and dad for money. Anne will not be receiving money from her mum and her dad.

Call 8	Anne is in the thoughts and prayers of some people. Call 9	Anne has an invitation to call someone, and meet up. Call 10 Anne is going to consent to sexual abuse.

Call 11 Anne is hiding from the world. Anne is crying for help. Anne used to make someone smile.

In terms of the status quo – the world of the play we are being intro- duced to – it seems that nothing is fixed. The first scene contains noth- ing of the easily identified, enclosed social worlds of The Seagull or Death of a Salesman; nor the clear myth-worlds of Macbeth or Little Red Riding Hood. It hasn’t even the cohesion of the country lane we discover Estragon and Vladimir on. Instead it is the fractured one of modern electronic communications, timelines and multiple identities. If there is going to be a turning point that kick-starts the story, it might emerge from any of the fragments of information we are given in the first scene.

assistant: Exercise 73 Breaking the Rules

Participants: All groups, individual

Choose a contemporary play that works in a non-naturalistic, abstract manner. Using the methods discussed in this chapter, examine how the playwright has revealed aspects of the main character.

Example 73.2 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon (adapted for the stage by Simon Stephens)

The play is based on Mark Haddon's novel and follows the story of Christopher Boone, a young boy with autism. The narrative style is less traditional and more abstract, as it reflects Christopher's unique perspective of the world.

1. The play opens with Christopher discovering the dead body of his neighbor's dog, Wellington. Instead of a traditional exposition, we are immediately thrown into the action and the unusual world of the protagonist.

2. Christopher's desire to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington serves as the main driving force of the play, revealing his intelligence, determination, and unique way of thinking.

3. The fractured narrative style, with scenes jumping between the present and the past, reflects Christopher's thought process and the way he experiences the world.

4. Christopher's interactions with other characters, such as his father, his teacher, and his neighbors, reveal aspects of his personality and the challenges he faces due to his autism.

5. The use of multimedia, projections, and non-traditional staging techniques help to convey Christopher's inner thoughts, emotions, and sensory experiences, further illustrating his unique perspective.

Despite the non-traditional narrative style and abstract presentation, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time effectively reveals the main character's traits, desires, and struggles, staying true to the principles discussed in this chapter. The play demonstrates that even in more abstract works, the core elements of storytelling and character development can still be present and effectively conveyed.

Outcome

On a first reading, it seems that the writer has thrown up an impenetrable smokescreen. But, as with the other examples, he has planted in ‘facts’ about the character: emotional life, social life, economic circumstances, etc. in the exposition. The status quo of the world is its fractured nature.   In a world that is fragmented, everything is a turning point.

The play, in its very form and structure, mirrors the complexities of mod- ern interactions (missed connections, multi-identities, shifting values). The writer, by seeming to break the rules/principles of more classic forms, is not denying them. He is commenting upon them. He clearly understood them. This will be useful to remember if your own play employs an unconventional style.

assistant: Outcome Assessment in the Context of Li Mei's Story

Li Mei's story, like the examples discussed earlier, can be approached using both traditional and unconventional storytelling techniques. The principles outlined in the chapter can still be applied to her story to create an engaging and compelling narrative, even if the form and structure diverge from classic forms.

1. Establish Li Mei's world: Set the scene in Li Mei's life, highlighting her emotional, social, and economic circumstances. This may involve her family, friends, or her daily routine as a student or worker.

2. Status quo: Introduce Li Mei's ordinary world, including her relationships, aspirations, and challenges. If her world is fractured or complex, this can be conveyed through non-linear storytelling or other unconventional techniques.

3. First Major Turning Point: Identify the event or decision that significantly changes Li Mei's life, propelling her into the main action of the story. This can be a personal choice, an external event, or a combination of both.

4. Breaking the rules: If Li Mei's story is better suited to a non-traditional narrative style, consider using abstract or unconventional storytelling methods. This might include multimedia, nonlinear timelines, or shifting perspectives.

5. Reflection of modern complexities: Li Mei's story can also comment on the complexities of modern life, such as cultural identity, generational differences, or the challenges faced by immigrants. By incorporating these themes, the story becomes a commentary on the larger societal context.

In conclusion, by understanding the principles of classic storytelling and adapting them to Li Mei's story, a compelling and engaging narrative can be crafted. Whether you choose a traditional or unconventional narrative style, the core elements of storytelling and character development can still be present and effectively conveyed in Li Mei's story.

5	Finding the story

As we have begun to discover, a story is an artificially constructed sequence of events that are rooted in the actions of the main character(s), or prota- gonist(s), a term we will be using from now on. The word is from the Greek protagonistes, which is made up of protos, meaning ‘first’ and agonistes, meaning ‘combatant’. So our protagonist is our ‘first combatant’, the one whose journey leads the action.

Actors do sometimes use the vocabulary of combat in relation to an audience, as in ‘I knocked them dead in act five’, or ‘this play will really sock it to them’. The British actor Alec Guinness once remarked,  ‘Tackling a live audience is like fighting a wild animal’. I’ve always thought it rather curious that the audience is often characterised as the enemy, some sort of beast to be subdued and controlled. Although, as any actor will tell you, each audience does have its own sort of collective identity and that can range from rapt attention through to indifference and downright hostility. However, the notion of having our ‘first combatant’ is a useful one for our purposes. It reminds us that – as with an actual physical battle – a story is about planned, forward-moving activity that (a) is led by someone, (b) has a purpose, (c) involves some form of struggle, and (d) has an outcome.

In Chapter 1 we began to look at ways of finding story-shapes (for example, Exercise 27), and in Chapter 4 we looked in detail at the way in which a fully explored character can contain the seeds of a story. In this chapter, we will see how we can map out a complete narrative structure, and what basic principles operate under any story. This is the craft of attending to ‘the solid carpentry of imparting information and laying fuses’. It is interesting that the word ‘carpentry’ was used, but I think that it is very appropriate in that playwrighting – as opposed to the more internationally

used playwriting – is a craft. ‘Wright’ derives from Old English, Old Saxon and High German words indicating ‘work’ and ‘making’, and its dictionary definition is: ‘a person who creates, builds, or repairs something specified: a playwright, shipwright’ (Collins English Dictionary). Just as the maker  of ships or chairs or knitted-jumpers must know the basic principles of the craft, so must the playwright understand those of their craft. This chapter will attend to the specifics of those principles.

assistant: Explaining Finding the Story with Li Mei's Story Example

Finding the story is about constructing a coherent and engaging narrative based on the main character's journey. In Li Mei's story, we need to consider the following aspects to develop her narrative:

1. Protagonist: Li Mei serves as the protagonist or "first combatant" in her story. She is the central character whose journey and actions will drive the story forward.

Example: Li Mei is a young Chinese immigrant living in a new country, trying to adapt to her new surroundings while maintaining her cultural identity.

2. Purpose: Determine Li Mei's primary goal or objective in her story, which will guide her actions and decisions throughout the narrative.

Example: Li Mei's purpose might be to find a balance between preserving her cultural heritage and fitting into her new environment.

3. Struggle: Identify the challenges and obstacles Li Mei faces in her journey, which will create tension and conflict in the story.

Example: Li Mei encounters difficulties in communicating due to language barriers, faces discrimination, and struggles with homesickness.

4. Outcome: Decide on the story's resolution, which can be either positive or negative. This outcome will be a result of Li Mei's actions and the challenges she faced throughout her journey.

Example: Li Mei eventually finds a community of people who share her background and experiences. She learns to embrace her new life while still honoring her cultural roots, leading to personal growth and a sense of belonging.

By considering these aspects, we can create a well-structured narrative for Li Mei's story. As we develop the story, we should also pay attention to the craft of playwriting, using techniques that effectively convey the story and its emotional impact. This includes understanding and applying the basic principles of storytelling and character development, which will be crucial in creating a compelling and engaging narrative for Li Mei's journey.

user: CHANGE

Change happens all the time in a story. We have already dipped into the Major Turning Point and how that crucially affects the turn of events for the journey of the protagonist. As we shall see, every moment of a play is about change, and it happens on any number of levels.

Change operates at all levels of human experience: the inner changes     of emotions, intellect, psychology and spirit, as well as the external and material changes. We can categorise these as:

External change:

●	Change of status.

●	Change of fortune.

●	Change of circumstance.

●	Change of allegiance.

●	Change of role.

●	Etc.

Internal change:

●	Change of mood.

●	Change of heart.

●	Change of mind.

●	Change of belief.

●	Change of view.

●	Change of affection.

●	Etc.

The finding and the development of the narrative is welded to the changes happening with the protagonist(s); so from now on, in all the work we do, everything we have learned about character and the protagonist will be brought into the process.

Here are a couple of exercises exploring change happening within a single sequence, or scene.

assistant: Exploring Change with Li Mei's Story Example

Let's explore external and internal changes in the context of Li Mei's story. We will create a scene that showcases different types of change happening within that single sequence.

Scene: Li Mei visits a local cultural festival in her new city.

External change:

1. Change of status: Li Mei gains respect from her classmates as she shows them aspects of her culture at the festival.

2. Change of fortune: Li Mei wins a small prize at one of the festival games.

3. Change of circumstance: Li Mei meets a group of people from her home country, expanding her social circle.

4. Change of allegiance: Li Mei starts to feel a stronger connection to her new city after experiencing the festival.

5. Change of role: Li Mei is asked to teach a traditional dance to a group of people at the festival.

Internal change:

1. Change of mood: Li Mei's mood shifts from feeling isolated to feeling connected and joyful.

2. Change of heart: Li Mei begins to appreciate her new city and the opportunities it offers.

3. Change of mind: Li Mei decides to join a cultural club to stay connected with her roots and share her culture with others.

4. Change of belief: Li Mei realizes that it is possible to maintain her cultural identity while embracing her new life.

5. Change of view: Li Mei starts seeing her new city as a place of opportunity and growth rather than a foreign land.

6. Change of affection: Li Mei develops a fondness for the new friends she has made at the festival.

By incorporating these different types of change in a single scene, we can create a dynamic and engaging sequence that moves Li Mei's story forward. It is essential to understand how change operates in a narrative to develop a compelling and well-rounded story.

Exercise 74 The empty room

Participants: All groups, individual (10–30 minutes)

As before, just follow the instructions and write down your immediate responses. The spontaneous response can often be the most creative one. Remember all the instant-writing/instant-character work already done.

1	Imagine an empty room.  It  can  be  anywhere  in  the  world. There is nothing in it at all. There is a source of light (natural or artificial)   and there is a way into the  room.  What  is  the  shape  of  the   room? What is it made from? What is the ‘feel’ of the room (smell, atmosphere, etc.)?

2	Now place an object in the room, something that could have been easily carried into it by one person. This object is going to be central to what happens next.

3	Now place a person in the room: Character X. Describe them in a little detail.

4	Now place a second person just outside the room and describe them in a little detail: Character Y.

5	Character Y enters the room.

6	Character X says something.

7	Character Y says something.

8	One of the characters leaves the room, with or without the object.

9	What type of change has happened?

As before, just follow the instructions and write down your immediate responses. The spontaneous response can often be the most creative one. Remember all the instant-writing/instant-character work already done.

assistant: 1. The room is rectangular, with wooden floors and white walls. It has a single window that allows sunlight to stream in, and a wooden door that leads into the room. The room feels slightly dusty, with an air of disuse, and it smells faintly of aged wood.

2. In the center of the room, there is an old, intricately carved wooden box.

3. Character X: Li Mei is a young woman in her early twenties, with long black hair and dark eyes. She is wearing casual clothes - a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers. She appears curious and slightly apprehensive.

4. Character Y: An elderly man with a warm smile and a gentle demeanor. He has gray hair and wears glasses, dressed in a simple button-down shirt and slacks.

5. The elderly man, Character Y, enters the room.

6. Li Mei says, "I found this wooden box in the room. Do you know what it is?"

7. Character Y replies, "Ah, that's an old family heirloom that belonged to your great-grandmother. It contains some of her most treasured memories."

8. Li Mei, feeling a stronger connection to her family's history, decides to take the wooden box with her as she leaves the room.

9. What type of change has happened?

- External change: Change of circumstance (discovering the wooden box and its significance)

- Internal change: Change of mood (from curiosity to reverence), change of view (regarding her family history and her great-grandmother), and change of affection (growing attachment to the wooden box and her family's past).

user: Adapt this example to Li Mei' story.

Example 74.1

●	A tall narrow room. It is made of dark wood. Warm and dusty.         A narrow window, high up on the wall. Very little light. A trap door.

●	A blonde, curly wig lies on the floor.

●	A large, pale-faced man sits in a corner. He wears a long, green robe. He is crying.

●	He is about 45. He picks up the wig and mops his eyes with it.

●	Outside the room is a bald woman. She is Scottish. She is in her 70s. She is wearing a dressing gown and slippers. She’s got a lot of makeup on.

●	The woman opens the trap door and comes into the room.

●	WOMAN: Freddie, just give it back to me, your father will be arriving in half an hour.

●	MAN: Mother, he’s got every right to know, you should tell him and if you won’t, then I will.

●	The man picks up the wig and leaves the room.

assistant: Example 74.1 adapted for Li Mei's story:

●	A small rectangular room with wooden floors and white walls. A single window high up on the wall, allowing sunlight to stream in. A wooden door leads into the room.

●	A beautifully carved wooden box lies on the floor.

●	Li Mei, a young woman in her early twenties, stands in the center of the room, examining the wooden box. She is wearing casual clothes and looks curious.

●	Outside the room is an elderly man with a warm smile and a gentle demeanor. He has gray hair, wears glasses, and is dressed in a simple button-down shirt and slacks.

●	The elderly man enters the room.

●	ELDERLY MAN: Li Mei, what have you found there?

●	LI MEI: I discovered this wooden box in the room. Do you know what it is?

●	The elderly man takes the wooden box and leaves the room, explaining that it's time to share the story of the family heirloom with Li Mei.

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

●	Even though this has been ‘instant writing’ and we don’t know anything more about the story, there has clearly been a change in the relations between the two people. The mother has made a demand, but the son has defied her and so her status has been lowered.

●	We don’t know anything more about the people in the sequence you have made, and we will leave them there. What you created was   a short scene in which, through a simple exchange of dialogue, trig- gered by an object, there has been some sort of change taking place.

assistant: Outcome for Li Mei's story adaptation:

● In this short scene, we see a significant shift in Li Mei's understanding of her family history. The discovery of the wooden box and the elderly man's decision to share the story behind it has potentially deepened their relationship and provided Li Mei with new information about her family's past.

● Even though this has been a brief and spontaneous piece of writing, it effectively demonstrates how change can take place within a scene through a simple exchange of dialogue and the presence of a meaningful object. The scene hints at the potential development of the story and the further exploration of Li Mei's character and her connection to her family's history.

user: Exercise 75 More empty rooms

Participants: All groups, individual

1	Look at the list of all the ways a person can change internally, in the emotional, intellectual, psychological, moral or indeed spiritual sense. Change of mood, of mind, of view, of principle, of belief, etc.

2	Look at the list of all the ways external change can happen to some- one. Change of status, of circumstance, etc.

3	Go back to the previous exercise. Create another room, an object, two people and the two lines of dialogue. Once again, don’t plan too much at the start, just arrive at your room and your object quite spontaneously. When you get to the two people, allow yourself a little time to think about what levels of change are happening with both characters.

4	Try the ‘empty room’ exercise a few more times. Each time explore different levels of change that are happening with the characters. Stick to the same structure, but allow a little more dialogue in if that feels appro- priate or useful. But remember that actions can speak louder than words.

assistant: 1. List of internal changes: change of mood, change of mind, change of view, change of principle, change of belief, change of affection, change of understanding, change of self-perception, etc.

2. List of external changes: change of status, change of circumstance, change of location, change of job, change of relationship, change of health, change of financial situation, change of appearance, etc.

3. Empty room exercise for Li Mei's story:

- A small, cluttered storage room in Li Mei's family home. Old family belongings and boxes are scattered everywhere. A single, dim lightbulb illuminates the room.

- A dusty, old photo album lies on top of a box.

- Li Mei, curious and excited, steps into the room.

- Her older cousin, Xiao Chen, hesitant and uncomfortable, stands outside the room.

- Xiao Chen enters the room.

- Li Mei: "I can't believe I've never seen this photo album before. It must be so old!"

- Xiao Chen: "Li Mei, that album contains some family secrets that were meant to be hidden. It's better if we leave it alone."

4. Additional 'empty room' exercises:

- A cozy, dimly lit living room. A warm fireplace crackles in the background.

- An intricately carved wooden box sits on a side table.

- Li Mei, curious and excited, steps into the room.

- Her grandmother, frail and gentle, stands outside the room.

- Her grandmother enters the room.

- Li Mei: "Grandma, I found this beautiful wooden box. It looks so old. What's the story behind it?"

- Grandmother: "Li Mei, that box has been passed down in our family for generations. Let me tell you the story of our ancestors and the sacrifices they made."

- A quiet, serene garden with blooming flowers and a small pond.

- A worn, leather-bound journal rests on a stone bench.

- Li Mei, contemplative and introspective, sits on the bench.

- Her father, stern and reserved, stands outside the garden.

- Her father enters the garden.

- Li Mei: "Dad, I found this journal. It seems to have some of our family's history written in it. I never knew about these events."

- Father: "Li Mei, our family's past is complicated. But knowing where we come from can help us understand who we are today."

In each of these scenarios, different levels of change occur within the characters. In the first scene, Li Mei's understanding of her family's past shifts, while Xiao Chen grapples with whether to reveal family secrets. In the second scene, Li Mei and her grandmother connect over their shared history, and the grandmother imparts wisdom to Li Mei. In the third scene, Li Mei's father shares his perspective on their family history, opening up a dialogue between them and potentially shifting their relationship.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

As I have said, and as we will see, in a fully developed play there is change happening all the time, from the small to the immense, from moment to moment, scene to scene and act to act. The playwright David

Hare once said: ‘Never allow a character to leave a scene the same as they entered it.’ There is always some shift, even if it is a slight one, which will take the story onwards. If a scene doesn’t do that it is quite likely to be redundant, and even if we don’t realise it as we are writing the play, you can be sure that good actors will sniff it out in rehearsals. I remember occasions when an actor has said, ‘We  don’t learn anything new in  the scene, so why is it here?’ and we then cut it. I hadn’t done my job properly and the actor’s instinct was spot-on.

assistant: An essential aspect of storytelling, particularly in plays, is the concept of change. When a character enters a scene, they should undergo some form of transformation or shift, whether big or small, by the time they exit. Change can occur in a variety of ways, such as through internal growth, emotional shifts, or alterations in external circumstances. A scene that doesn't contribute to character development or advance the plot may be considered redundant and might be removed during the rehearsal process.

For example, let's consider a scene from Li Mei's story:

Li Mei and her best friend, Lin, sit in a cafe discussing their dreams and aspirations. Li Mei wants to explore her family's history, while Lin dreams of becoming a professional dancer.

- Li Mei enters the scene feeling uncertain about her family's past and her place within it.

- Lin enters the scene feeling self-conscious about her dancing abilities.

During the conversation, Li Mei shares her recent discoveries from the photo album, and Lin discusses her latest dance audition. They both encourage and support each other in their endeavors.

- Li Mei leaves the scene feeling inspired to delve deeper into her family's history and more confident in her journey.

- Lin leaves the scene feeling more optimistic about her dancing career and motivated to work harder.

In this example, both Li Mei and Lin experience change during the scene. Li Mei gains confidence in her pursuit of family history, while Lin feels more hopeful about her dancing aspirations. The changes in their emotional states and outlooks are essential to the overall story, making this scene significant.

If the scene had been written without any meaningful change or development for either character, it might be considered unnecessary, and actors might question its purpose during rehearsals. The playwright's responsibility is to ensure that each scene serves a purpose in advancing the story or character development, thus keeping the audience engaged and invested in the narrative.

user: Exercise 76 Change beneath the surface

Participants: All groups, individual

Here is an exercise that allows you to explore psychological and emotional change through a surface ‘activity’.

1	Write a list of ordinary, daily activities that can be shared. For example: making a bed, preparing a meal, laying a table, bathing the baby, clearing a classroom, getting the bar ready for opening time, stacking the shelves, playing cards, planning a route, etc.

2	Choose one. If it is a task you are familiar with, so much the better, as you will be familiar with the detail.

3	You are going to write a scene in which characters X and Y are both engaged in this activity.

4	Character X is ‘in charge’ and knows exactly what needs to be done. Character Y is the ‘helper’ and is not familiar with the process.

5	The dialogue is driven by the mechanics of the task in hand: questions, answers, mistakes, corrections, etc.

6	Once you have decided on the task and the two characters, start writing. Don’t think about personality, psychology, etc. Don’t over plan, just allow the scene to write itself out.

7	Don’t try and force anything onto the scene, but if topics arise naturally out of the activity, then allow them in (for example, if the task is ‘making the bed’ and the sheets for the bed are old linen and belonged to great-grandma, then some discussion of her might be appropriate). But always keep the focus of attention on the task in hand. Write the scene through until the task is fully completed. Be as detailed as you can. (See Example 76.1.)

8	Look through the scene (or have it read out if you are working with a group). See what clues are in the scene as to what the relationship between the characters might be. (See Example 76.2.)

9	You are now going to think about a second draft of the scene. As before, the task will be completed from start to finish, so you know  how the mechanics of the scene works. The focus of the scene will be on the task. This time though, there will be a change in the relation- ship between X and Y. Give the characters in the scene very strong objectives. Make notes on how the scene will develop. (See  Example 76.3.)

Write the scene in the context of li mei's story.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we will have Li Mei (Character X) and her cousin, Jia (Character Y), engage in the activity of organizing old family photos.

1. The task: Organizing old family photos in albums.

2. Li Mei is in charge of the task, and Jia is the helper, unfamiliar with the family history.

Start writing the scene:

LI MEI: Alright, let's start by sorting the photos by date. Do you see any with years written on the back?

JIA: Um, this one says 1965. Where should I put it?

LI MEI: Place it in this pile, with the other 1960s photos. And if you find any from the 1970s, put them in this other pile.

(They continue sorting the photos.)

JIA: Who is this man with the hat in this photo?

LI MEI: Oh, that's our great-uncle. He was a soldier during the war.

JIA: I never knew that. We have such an interesting family history.

(They continue organizing the photos, occasionally discussing family members and events.)

LI MEI: You're getting the hang of it. It's nice to have some help with this.

JIA: I'm glad I could be here. I feel more connected to our family now.

(They finish organizing the photos and close the album.)

Now, assess the scene and identify any clues about the relationship between Li Mei and Jia. In this scene, Li Mei is guiding Jia through the process of organizing family photos. They are cousins, and through their interaction, Jia learns more about their family history. The task allows them to bond and grow closer.

For the second draft, we can strengthen their objectives and explore a change in their relationship:

- Li Mei's objective: Share her family's history with Jia and make her feel more connected to their roots.

- Jia's objective: Learn more about her family and develop a closer bond with Li Mei.

In the revised scene, Li Mei may intentionally share more stories and anecdotes about their family while organizing the photos. Jia, on the other hand, can ask more in-depth questions about their family members and events. By the end of the scene, their bond has grown stronger, and they have a deeper understanding of each other and their family history.

user: compare your answers with the answers and find the lessons.

assistant: Comparing the exercise response with the original example, we can draw some lessons about the structure and development of the scene. The main takeaway is that the scene, driven by a task, can reveal the relationship between the characters and create opportunities for change.

In the Li Mei's story scene, the task of organizing old family photos brings Li Mei and Jia closer together, allowing them to bond over their shared family history. This is similar to the original example (Example 76.1) where the task of making a bed drives the dialogue and reveals the relationship between the characters.

The lesson here is that focusing on a task can provide a natural setting for dialogue and character interaction. This can help the characters reveal information about themselves and their relationships, providing depth and nuance to the story. Moreover, giving the characters strong objectives can strengthen the scene, adding layers to their interaction, and ultimately, showing a change in their relationship.

In both cases, the scenes begin with the characters focused on the task, and through their dialogue and interactions, we learn more about their relationships and personalities. By the end of the scenes, there is a shift in the relationship between the characters, demonstrating the importance of change and growth within a story.

user: compare your answers with the following answers and improve yours.

Example 76.1

Y:    Carrot soup? Yum. X: Just for you and me. Y: Just us. I thought . . .

X: You cut the oranges, I’ll peel the carrots. Y: Oranges?

X:  Oranges.

Y: In carrot soup? X: Sure.

Y: Ugh.

X: Lovely.

Y: Ugh.

X: You wait. Pass me the knife.

Y:     I thought you wanted me to cut the oranges.  X: That’s the carrot knife. This is the orange knife. Y: Does it matter?

X: In my kitchen it does. Y: Little drink?

X: Too early.

Y: Let’s open this little bottle . . . X: No, no it’s for the soup.

Y: Cognac in soup?

Etc.

Example 76.2

Attitudes, characteristics and status issues have already begun to appear:   Y is a bit conventional when it comes to soup making; it is X’s kitchen and recipe and s/he is a bit territorial. In your own scene, allow such details to emerge. You will now have a scene in which an activity has been completed. You will also – thanks to the work done in the previous chapters – have some idea of who the characters are, what their relationship is, etc.

Example 76.3

●	X wants to win the affections of Y through his/her sophisticated cookery skills.

●	Y is not impressed and clearly regards X as a food-snob.

●	The soup is foul and X is distraught.

●	Y feels sorry for X, produces a can of tomato soup, heats it up and  they talk about comfort food.

●	X has shifted from attempting to control the situation to accepting help.

●	Y has shifted from critical to compassionate.

assistant: Comparing the exercise response in Li Mei's story with the original example (Example 76.1, 76.2, 76.3), we can refine the response and draw more lessons about the structure and development of the scene.

In Li Mei's story, the scene could be rewritten as follows:

Li Mei: Do you remember this photo, Jia? We were so young back then!

Jia: Oh, wow! That was taken during our family trip to the Great Wall, right?

Li Mei: Yes, exactly! Can you help me sort these photos into different albums?

Jia: Sure, I can do that. Let's start with the family trips.

Li Mei: That's a good idea. Here's another photo from our trip to the Forbidden City. I remember it was so crowded that day.

Jia: And look at this one, it's from our beach vacation. We had so much fun building sandcastles together.

As they continue sorting the photos, their conversation reveals more about their relationship, personalities, and shared memories. By the end of the scene, Li Mei and Jia have bonded over their family history and become closer.

To incorporate the lessons from Example 76.3, we can add some objectives and changes to the scene:

- Li Mei wants to reconnect with Jia by reminiscing about their shared family memories.

- Jia initially seems disinterested in the task, but gradually becomes more engaged as they share memories.

- The scene could end with Jia finding a photo of their late grandmother, prompting an emotional conversation and deepening their bond.

- Li Mei shifts from trying to engage Jia to opening up about her feelings, while Jia shifts from being disinterested to showing empathy and understanding.

By comparing the original exercise response with the provided examples, we can refine the scene to create a more engaging narrative that demonstrates change and growth in the characters' relationship.

Outcome

You will now have developed a scene in which there has been a signifi- cant change for the protagonists, signalled through the way a shared activity is negotiated. What you have been experimenting with is subtext, which is the next item on the menu.

assistant: In the revised scene from Li Mei's story, the characters, Li Mei and Jia, are sorting through old family photos. Through this shared activity, the subtext of their relationship is revealed, as well as the changes in their emotions and attitudes towards each other.

Outcome:

The scene demonstrates a significant change in the protagonists' relationship, driven by the way they negotiate the shared activity. By engaging in the task of sorting photos, Li Mei and Jia reveal their emotions, memories, and connections to each other, which is an example of subtext.

Example:

At the beginning of the scene, Li Mei is trying to engage Jia in reminiscing about their shared family memories. Jia initially seems disinterested in the task:

Li Mei: Do you remember this photo, Jia? We were so young back then!

Jia: Oh, wow! That was taken during our family trip to the Great Wall, right?

Li Mei: Yes, exactly! Can you help me sort these photos into different albums?

Jia: Sure, I can do that. Let's start with the family trips.

As they continue sorting the photos, their conversation reveals more about their relationship, personalities, and shared memories:

Li Mei: That's a good idea. Here's another photo from our trip to the Forbidden City. I remember it was so crowded that day.

Jia: And look at this one, it's from our beach vacation. We had so much fun building sandcastles together.

By the end of the scene, Jia finds a photo of their late grandmother, prompting an emotional conversation and deepening their bond:

Jia: Li Mei, look at this photo of grandma. I miss her so much.

Li Mei: I miss her too, Jia. She was always there for us, wasn't she?

Through this shared activity, the subtext of their relationship is revealed. Li Mei shifts from trying to engage Jia to opening up about her feelings, while Jia shifts from being disinterested to showing empathy and understanding. The scene highlights the significant change in their relationship through the negotiation of a shared task, demonstrating the concept of subtext in the scene.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

SUBTEXT

Subtext: any meaning or set of meanings which is implied rather than stated in literary work, especially in a play. Read any play by Harold Pinter and you will find that the seemingly banal and ‘surface’ dialogue is actually loaded with implied meaning.

As any actor will tell you, the most interesting texts for them are those in which the true meanings of the lines they are delivering are ‘under the surface’ as it were. This is worth remembering, as it is actors for whom we are writing. Of course, there are the scenes and speeches where great inner truths are revealed, but as a general principle the actor will seek the ‘what is not said’, the stuff that is going on under the surface. In the plays by Harold Pinter you will see that the evasiveness of the dialogue and the carefully planted pauses are where the riches lie. Hamlet, even if he is actu- ally spelling out all his thoughts, as characters in Shakespeare tend to, goes on at some length about the question of being or not being, but he fails to answer it. What is not said, not concluded, left open, is more interesting for the actor, and for the audience.

Here are some exercises that continue to explore the place of change in a scene, but with an emphasis on subtext. There will be a shared activity, but it will not be quite so obviously the motor of the scene as wigs and soup-making were in previous examples.

assistant: Let's take a look at an example in which the subtext plays an important role in revealing the characters' underlying emotions and intentions. In this scene, two friends, Sarah and Jessica, are painting a room together:

Sarah: You know, I've always loved this shade of blue.

Jessica: Yeah, it's a nice color. Reminds me of the ocean.

On the surface, it appears as though they are simply discussing their painting task. However, the subtext implies that there is more going on beneath the surface of their conversation:

Sarah (thinking): I hope she likes the color I chose. I really want this room to be perfect for our new project.

Jessica (thinking): This is such a bold choice. I don't know if I can handle seeing this color every day.

As the scene progresses, their conversation continues, revealing more of the subtext:

Sarah: I think this room will be perfect for our new art studio.

Jessica: I hope so. It's a big investment.

The subtext here shows that Jessica is worried about the financial aspect of their joint venture, while Sarah is more focused on the aesthetics and atmosphere of the space. This adds depth to their characters and their relationship, as well as tension in the scene.

To further emphasize subtext, Sarah and Jessica could have a conversation about a seemingly unrelated topic, like a recent vacation, while their true concerns about the art studio linger beneath the surface:

Sarah: Did I tell you about my trip to the beach last weekend? It was so relaxing.

Jessica: That sounds nice. I haven't been able to get away for a while.

In this example, the subtext implies that Jessica may be stressed or anxious about their joint venture and unable to find time for relaxation. Through these exercises and examples, we can see how focusing on subtext can make a scene richer and more engaging, providing actors and audiences with a more complex and interesting story to explore.

user: Please give examples in the context of Li mei' story.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create a scene where Li Mei and her friend, Chen, are folding origami cranes together while discussing their plans for the future. The subtext of the scene highlights their different perspectives and worries.

Scene:

Li Mei and Chen sit at a table, folding paper cranes. They are halfway through their task of making one hundred cranes as a symbol of hope and good fortune.

Li Mei: I really hope this works. I've heard that folding one hundred cranes can bring good luck.

Chen: Yeah, it's a nice tradition. My grandmother used to say it helped her through tough times.

Subtext:

Li Mei (thinking): I need all the luck I can get with the job interview coming up. I can't afford to fail.

Chen (thinking): I wonder if she's worried about something. She seems more focused on the cranes than usual.

As the scene continues, their conversation touches on their future aspirations, with the subtext revealing their underlying concerns:

Li Mei: Chen, do you ever worry about not achieving your dreams?

Chen: Sometimes, but I try to focus on the things I can control, like my work ethic and attitude.

Subtext:

Li Mei (thinking): I'm terrified of failing and letting my family down. Chen seems to have it all figured out.

Chen (thinking): I'm not as confident as I seem. I hope I can support Li Mei if she needs help.

To emphasize the subtext further, Li Mei and Chen could discuss a seemingly unrelated topic, like a movie they recently watched, while their thoughts reveal their true concerns:

Li Mei: Did you watch that new movie everyone's talking about?

Chen: Yeah, I enjoyed it. It was a good distraction from all the stress.

Subtext:

Li Mei (thinking): I couldn't even enjoy the movie because I was so worried about my future.

Chen (thinking): I wish I could help her feel more at ease. I know she's struggling right now.

In this example, focusing on subtext brings depth to the characters and their relationship, allowing the audience to better understand their emotional states and underlying concerns while engaging in an everyday activity.

Exercise 77 Reading a newspaper Part one

Participants: All groups

For this exercise you will need a range of newspapers of the day: broad- sheet and tabloid, local and national. Before starting, think a little about   all the different things a newspaper contains: news items (wars, crime, celebrity goings-on, royal scandals, politics etc.), advertisements, letters, agony columns, editorials, crosswords, sport, etc. All or any of these will become the focus of the exercise.

1	Divide up into groups of three. Decide who is A, B and C. Each group has one newspaper (comic-book or magazine, etc., if appropriate to the group).

2	A and B will be ‘readers’.

3	C will be an ‘invisible recorder’. In this role, C will have a notepad and pen.

4	A and B will look through the newspaper and will have a conversation about items in it.

5	C will not participate in the conversation at all, but will remain as if invisible. The task is to jot down, in note form, the general development of the conversation. The emphasis is on  ‘note  form’. There should be no anxiety about getting every single word down; the function of the notes is to record the main outline of what is said.

6	A and B should not feel they have to read the whole paper. The object is to allow the items they read to prompt their own thoughts, com- ments, memories and feelings. However, remember the exercise is called ‘reading a newspaper’. The conversation will drift away from what is in the newspaper, but it should always return to that focus of attention.

7	The conversation should  be  allowed  to  go  on  for  a  good 10–15 minutes.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's set up a scene where Li Mei, her friend Chen, and her cousin Jia are sitting together in a café, each reading a different section of the newspaper.

A: Li Mei (Reader)

B: Chen (Reader)

C: Jia (Invisible Recorder)

Li Mei, Chen, and Jia sit at a table in a cozy café. Li Mei and Chen are browsing through the newspaper, discussing various items they come across, while Jia remains quiet, taking notes of their conversation.

Li Mei: Did you see this article about the new technology park opening in our city?

Chen: Yeah, I heard it's going to create a lot of job opportunities.

Jia (notes): New technology park, job opportunities

Li Mei: Speaking of jobs, there's an advertisement for a company hiring for the position I interviewed for last week.

Chen: That's great! Did you hear back from them yet?

Jia (notes): Job advertisement, Li Mei's interview

Chen: Oh, look at this. They're building a new community center near our neighborhood.

Li Mei: That's nice. It'll be a good place to hang out and meet new people.

Jia (notes): New community center, socializing

Li Mei: There's a letter to the editor complaining about the increasing cost of living. I can definitely relate to that.

Chen: Me too. It's getting harder to make ends meet.

Jia (notes): Cost of living, financial struggles

Chen: Check out the sports section. Our local team made it to the finals!

Li Mei: That's exciting! We should go watch the game together.

Jia (notes): Local team in finals, plan to watch the game

Throughout their conversation, Li Mei and Chen touch upon various topics from the newspaper, sharing their thoughts and experiences. Jia, as the invisible recorder, captures the essence of their conversation in note form, without participating in the discussion. This exercise helps to highlight the different aspects of their lives and gives a glimpse into their characters and concerns.

user: compare your answers to this example and draw the lessons.

Example 77.1

This is and example of a type of full conversation that C would make notes on.

A: A hundred and ninety-seven million! That’s gross!

B: [READS] ‘Andrew Jack Whittaker was already blessed and he was wealthy by most standards when he turned up yesterday dressed in his trademark black, from the tip of his cowboy boots to his stetson  hat . . . ’ America, he’s American, that explains it, that . . .

A:  I bet there’s people in England who’d do that, I bet . . . B: Would you?

A: Dunno ... no... it’s gross. Look here, it says all those asylum seekers are destitute, it’s not right, why should . . .

B: My dad says the asylum seekers . . .

A: So does mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s right. I told him his dad came to this country, so what does that make his dad?

B: Does your dad do the lottery?

A: He won ten pounds last week. Said he’s used it for my birthday present.

B: Is it your birthday? A: Saturday.

B: Let’s look at the stars. What’s your sign? A: Capricorn.

B: I’m Virgo. I wish I were something else.

A: Hope he spends more than a tenner on me, I told him I wanted that latest . . .

B: Look at that dress Britney Spears has got on, I wish . . . A: Britney Spears is rubbish.

B: I wonder what star sign she is?

A: I wouldn’t be seen dead in a dress like that.

B: You couldn’t afford a dress like that. My dad said . . . A: She’s jail bait.

B: My dad . . .

A: Here’s the stars.

Etc.

assistant: In the given example, the conversation between A and B revolves around various topics in the newspaper, such as lottery winnings, asylum seekers, celebrity fashion, and horoscopes. The conversation is more casual and varied than the previous Li Mei example, and it includes more personal opinions, expressions, and shared experiences.

Comparing the Li Mei example to Example 77.1, we can draw the following lessons:

1. Include more personal opinions and reactions: In the Li Mei example, the conversation was mostly factual and focused on the newspaper content. However, Example 77.1 demonstrates a more natural conversation where the readers share their opinions and reactions to the articles.

2. Encourage more back-and-forth dialogue: In Example 77.1, the conversation flows smoothly with a good balance of questions and responses. This creates a more engaging and dynamic conversation.

3. Include shared experiences and personal stories: Example 77.1 shows the characters discussing their families, personal experiences, and preferences, which adds depth and relatability to the characters.

4. Don't be afraid to let the conversation drift: In Example 77.1, the conversation sometimes drifts away from the newspaper but still feels natural and authentic. Allowing the conversation to move organically can lead to interesting insights into the characters and their relationships.

5. Use a variety of topics: In both examples, the characters discuss a range of topics. This variety can showcase different aspects of the characters' lives, interests, and concerns, making the scene more engaging and informative.

By incorporating these lessons, the Li Mei example can be improved to create a more natural and engaging conversation that offers deeper insight into the characters and their relationships.

user: Part two

Participants: All groups

1	Each group will now have its conversation in note form.

2	The task now is for C to go through the notes, with A and B putting them in their own notebooks.

3	Now A, B and C will have an identical set of notes.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's assume A and B had a conversation, and C jotted down the notes as mentioned in Exercise 77 Reading a newspaper Part one. Now in Part two:

1. C will share their notes with A and B. The conversation notes may cover topics like local news, cultural events, politics, and personal experiences related to the newspaper articles.

2. A, B, and C will ensure their notes are accurate and consistent, discussing any discrepancies or missing details. This process ensures that each participant has a clear understanding of the conversation they had.

3. Once the notes are finalized, A, B, and C will copy them into their own notebooks. This step enables each participant to have a personal record of the conversation and serves as a reference for any further discussions or exercises.

The shared notes will help A, B, and C reflect on their conversation, analyze the topics covered, and understand the underlying themes or subtexts. This exercise can provide valuable insights into the characters' interests, opinions, and relationships, enriching the overall narrative of Li Mei's story.

user: do this exercise in the context of Li mei's story please.

Part three

Participants: All groups

1	Everyone will now work singly, from the notes they have.

2	The notes will form the raw material for a conversation between two characters, A and B.

3	This time the characters are fictional.

4	Give the characters names and think of them as totally different from the people who had the original conversation. Use Exercises 22 and 23 in Chapter 1 to name the characters.

5	Look through the notes. See what sorts of things come up in the conversation. Are there topics that the two people keep coming back to? What is the general drift of the conversation?

6	See if the conversation and the things that are discussed give a clue as to what is going on that is not talked about. What might be going on under the surface? See if there are clues as to some sort of change that is happening to one or both of the characters.

7	Rewrite the conversation in the light of what you discovered in step 8.

8	If you find that the conversation is going off into new and interesting territory, allow it to do so. Remember that you always have the notes to support you if you feel stuck.

9	Work hard to keep the things that are really being expressed under the surface, in the subtext. Think of ‘hint’, ‘almost say’, ‘suggest’, as opposed to ‘tell’, ‘confess’, ‘explain’.

10	Remember that the task is not to reproduce the original conversation, but to use it as an inspiration to develop a new one.

11	Find a way for the scene to conclude.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create a conversation between two characters, A and B, based on the newspaper conversation notes from Exercise 77 Part one and Part two.

1. From the notes, we create a conversation between two fictional characters, Xia and Chen, who are friends of Li Mei.

2. The conversation notes cover various topics, such as local news, cultural events, politics, and personal experiences. Some topics that they keep coming back to are cultural events and their personal experiences.

3. As Xia and Chen discuss the newspaper articles, we notice that there might be something going on under the surface. Xia seems to be more interested in cultural events, while Chen appears to be more focused on personal experiences.

4. While they talk about these topics, we can sense some subtle changes happening in their relationship. Xia seems to be growing more enthusiastic about the cultural events, possibly hinting at a desire to explore new experiences. On the other hand, Chen appears to be more nostalgic, reflecting on the past and how things used to be.

5. We can rewrite the conversation by emphasizing these subtle changes in the characters. For example, Xia may become more excited and curious about the cultural events, while Chen may reminisce more about past experiences.

6. As the conversation goes on, we allow it to develop naturally, using the notes as a reference to keep the discussion flowing. Xia and Chen may start hinting at their feelings and desires without explicitly stating them, keeping the subtext alive.

7. To conclude the scene, Xia might suggest attending a cultural event together, and Chen, after some hesitation, may agree. This decision could signify a subtle shift in their relationship, as they both step out of their comfort zones and try something new together.

The exercise helps us explore the subtext and underlying emotions in a conversation between Xia and Chen, enriching the overall narrative of Li Mei's story and adding depth to their characters.

user: analyse the answer

Example 77.2

●	Look for something in the scene that is half-referred to (asylum seekers) or is conspicuous by its absence (no mention of mums).

●	Use that as a clue to what you decide is going on under the surface. Let’s take mums. Why are they never mentioned? What is the story there?

●	Insert into the background story the fact that character B’s mum has recently died.

●	Rewrite the scene bearing in mind that both characters are very aware of this fact, but are avoiding it. We’ve all been in social situations where a subject we want to steer clear of keeps making itself known,

despite all our efforts. This  is one of those.  Already  character  A’s line ‘I wouldn’t be seen dead in a dress like that’ becomes very loaded.

●	Explore the tension between not talking about B’s mum and B’s possible (unconscious) need to talk about her mum.

●	In terms of change, see if there is a moment when B’s need to talk about her mum bursts through the surface: where she moves from denial to the beginnings of acceptance.

assistant: Analyzing Example 77.2, we can derive some key points on how to incorporate the subtext into a conversation, particularly in the context of Li Mei's story.

1. Identify a half-referred topic or a conspicuous absence: In Example 77.2, the topic of mums is not mentioned, and we can use this as a clue for something going on under the surface.

2. Create a background story: In the example, character B's mum has recently died. This adds depth to the conversation as the characters are aware of this fact but avoid discussing it.

3. Rewrite the scene with the background story in mind: By incorporating the background story, the conversation becomes more emotionally charged. For example, the line "I wouldn't be seen dead in a dress like that" gains a new meaning.

4. Explore the tension between avoiding the subject and the need to address it: In the example, character B might unconsciously want to talk about her mum, creating a sense of tension and conflict in the conversation.

5. Incorporate change in the scene: The scene can show a moment when B's need to talk about her mum finally breaks through, signaling a shift from denial to the beginnings of acceptance.

Applying these points to Li Mei's story, let's say Xia and Chen are aware of a recent argument between Li Mei and her parents. They avoid discussing it directly, but the tension is apparent in their conversation. As they talk about cultural events and personal experiences, their lines may carry a hidden meaning related to Li Mei's situation.

For example, when discussing a cultural event, Xia could say, "I think it's important to explore new horizons," hinting at Li Mei's desire for change. Chen might respond, "But sometimes, we need to appreciate what we have," suggesting a more conservative perspective on Li Mei's choices.

Throughout the conversation, the tension between avoiding the subject and the need to address it could increase. Finally, Chen might say, "I just hope Li Mei is okay," breaking the barrier and opening the door for a deeper discussion about Li Mei's situation. This change could signify a shift in their relationship, as they move from avoiding the topic to confronting it together.

user: assess the outcome please

Outcome

You now have a scene in which a conversation prompted by a newspaper has allowed you to play with the notion of subtext. From this point on, in all the work, we will constantly hold onto the notion of change and subtext.

assistant: Assessing the outcome of the exercise, we can see that it successfully demonstrated the use of subtext in a conversation while maintaining a focus on change. By working with a conversation prompted by a newspaper, you have explored how to incorporate hidden meanings and emotions into seemingly everyday discussions.

Throughout the process, you have managed to:

1. Identify and utilize subtext by finding a topic that was indirectly referred to or conspicuously absent, and using it as the basis for the underlying emotional context of the conversation.

2. Develop a background story that influences the characters' dialogue and adds depth to the scene.

3. Rewrite and shape the conversation in a way that highlights the subtext and makes it more emotionally charged, adding complexity and intrigue.

4. Explore the tension between the characters' avoidance of the subject and their need to address it, which creates a sense of conflict and increases audience engagement.

5. Incorporate change in the scene, signifying a shift in the characters' relationship and the development of the story.

With the successful completion of this exercise, you have gained valuable insights into using subtext in your writing. As you continue to develop scenes and dialogues, remember to always consider the aspects of change and subtext to create more engaging and emotionally resonant stories.

user: Exercise 78 Looking at a view Part one

Participants: All groups

This exercise follows on from the last, in that it deals purely with subtext. There is no actual physical activity, no wigs, soup or newspapers, just    two people looking at a view and having a conversation. It will be an opportunity to fully explore ‘the stuff that is going on under the surface’.

1	Work in groups of three.

2	A and B will be the speakers, C the ‘invisible note-taker’.

3	Find a view. If you are working in a building, find a window to look out of onto a view that has a variety of things of interest (a busy street, a playground, a park). If you can go outside, go into the park itself, or any public place. Whatever you choose, try for a view that is

(a)	public, (b) exterior and (c) includes the sky.

4	As with the previous exercise, A and B talk to each other, and C invis- ibly records in note form.

5	Again, the object is to simply allow the view to stimulate the conversa- tion, but allowing what is seen to stimulate other thoughts, memories, etc. Again, always come back to ‘the view’ as the focus of attention.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's imagine A, B, and C as Li Mei, her friend Xiao Chen, and an invisible note-taker respectively. They are looking at a view from the window of Li Mei's apartment, which overlooks a busy street, a small park, and the sky above.

1. Li Mei and Xiao Chen stand by the window, observing the view and engaging in a conversation.

2. The invisible note-taker, C, listens to their conversation and takes notes in a concise form, focusing on the key points and topics that arise.

As they talk, Li Mei and Xiao Chen may discuss various aspects of the view, such as the people they see, the activities happening in the park, or even the weather. They may also use the view as a starting point for more personal conversations, reminiscing about past experiences, discussing their thoughts, and expressing their feelings. The note-taker will capture these moments in the conversation and use them to explore the subtext between the two friends.

Remember, the conversation between Li Mei and Xiao Chen should frequently return to the view, as it serves as the main focus of their discussion.

user: analyze this answer and compare it with yours pls.

Example 78.1

This is an example of a type of full conversation that C would make notes on. Two people are standing on a riverbank with a view of trees.

A: What sort of tree is that? B: An elm?

A: Elm. That’s a strange word. B: Is it an elm?

A: It’s not oak.

B: It’s not an elm. A:  It’s not a yew. B: Yew?

A: They’re found in graveyards.

B: That’s a playing field, it’s not a graveyard.

A: Could’ve been, once. There’s a church over there.

B:    Did you ever see that film? Where their house was on the site of       a graveyard, the dead came back through the floorboards.

A: Scary.

B: Would you come here in the dark? A: Not if I was drunk.

B: Why not?

A:   Might fall in the river. B: Doesn’t look very deep. A: No.

Long silence.

B: What’s it called?

A:  Dunno. It’s more of a stream, really. B: River, I’d say.

Silence.

A: Got any gum?

B:   Yeah.

A:   Look.

B: What?

A: On the bridge. Someone fishing. I wouldn’t want to eat a fish out of there.

B: Why not?

A: There’s those factories the other way. There’d be all the muck coming out of them.

Etc.

assistant: In the given example, two people are standing on a riverbank looking at trees and discussing various aspects of their surroundings. The conversation moves from the type of tree they are looking at to the possibility of the playing field once being a graveyard, to a scary movie and finally, to someone fishing in the river.

In the context of Li Mei's story, the conversation between Li Mei and Xiao Chen was focused on the view from Li Mei's apartment window, which included a busy street, a park, and the sky. They discussed various aspects of the view and used it as a starting point for more personal conversations.

Comparing both examples, it's clear that the conversations are centered around a specific view or setting, which serves as the main focus of the discussion. In both cases, the speakers touch upon different topics related to the view and then branch out to other subjects, while still returning to the central focus.

However, the given example (78.1) is more focused on the natural aspects of the view (trees, river, etc.), whereas the conversation in Li Mei's story features a more urban setting (busy street, park, etc.). The way both conversations move between different topics is similar, but the actual topics discussed are different due to the distinct contexts.

In both scenarios, the conversations can be used to explore the subtext between the characters, as their exchanges about the view may reveal deeper thoughts, feelings, or connections. The notes taken from both conversations can be used as the basis for developing a scene with a focus on subtext and the underlying emotions or changes occurring between the characters.

user: do the exercise in the context of li mei's story.

Part two

Participants: All groups

1	Each group will now have its own set of notes.

2	The task now is for A and B to copy down the notes made by C.

3	A, B and C now have identical sets of notes.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's assume that during the conversation between Li Mei and Xiao Chen, a third person, C, was silently taking notes of their conversation.

1. After the conversation has ended, A (Li Mei), B (Xiao Chen), and C will now have their own set of notes.

2. A (Li Mei) and B (Xiao Chen) will copy down the notes made by C, ensuring that all three participants have an identical set of notes from the conversation.

3. With the notes copied, Li Mei, Xiao Chen, and the third person (C) now have a shared record of their conversation about the view from Li Mei's apartment window. These notes will later be used to develop a fictional conversation between two new characters, exploring the subtext and underlying emotions or changes occurring between them.

user: Part three

Participants: All groups

1	Everyone now works on their own.

2	The characters are now fictional. Name them.

3	You will invest one of the characters with a pre-occupation: something that is weighing on their mind and will affect their mood, their language, etc. This will not be directly communicated in the dialogue, but which will inform what they say and how they say it. (See Examples 78.1.)

4	You are going to write a scene in which ‘nothing happens’. Again, the original conversation is there to support you, not to be reproduced. Keep it as ordinary as possible, by imagining it as an early scene in a play: any big revelations will happen later on in the play.

5	See what imagery is there that can be used and adapted to serve the needs of rewrite. (See Example 78.2.)

6	See if, in the course of the conversation, there is a change that takes place within the characters, and how this might affect the things that are said. Explore the subtext but avoid any melodramatic effects.  (See Examples 78.3.)

7	Finish the scene with one of the characters leaving.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create a fictional conversation between two new characters, named Jia and Lin, who are looking out of Li Mei's apartment window.

1. Everyone now works on their own, using the notes taken during Li Mei and Xiao Chen's conversation as inspiration.

2. The characters are now fictional: Jia and Lin.

3. Jia is preoccupied with a recent job loss, which is affecting their mood and language during the conversation. This preoccupation will remain unspoken, but will inform the dialogue.

4. Write a scene in which "nothing happens." Use the original conversation as inspiration, but don't feel obligated to reproduce it. Keep the scene as ordinary as possible, like an early scene in a play where the big revelations happen later.

5. Find imagery from the original conversation that can be adapted for this new scene. For example, Jia and Lin might discuss the trees, river, and factories they see from the window.

6. Explore how the conversation affects Jia and Lin, and whether there's a change in their emotions, thoughts, or relationship. Pay attention to the subtext and avoid melodramatic effects.

Example:

Jia: That tree near the river is so tall.

Lin: Yeah, it's been there for years. I always loved coming here to watch the water flow by.

Jia: The river seems a bit polluted today, don't you think?

Lin: Maybe, but it's still peaceful here. It's a nice place to escape from everything.

7. Conclude the scene with one of the characters leaving. For instance, Jia might decide to go for a walk to clear their mind after the conversation with Lin.

By completing this exercise, you'll have written a scene focusing on subtext and the underlying emotions of the characters, while keeping the conversation seemingly ordinary and uneventful.

user: compare your answers to the examples and find lessons.

Examples 78.1

●	The character has recently been told she has a life-threatening illness.

●	The character has just won a fortune on the lottery.

●	The character has just failed her exams.

●	The character’s pet dog has just died.

●	The character has recently fallen in love.

●	The character is falling in love with the other character.

●	Etc.

Example 78.2

●	There has been a great deal about death in the conversation so far, so I would invest one of the characters with a negative pre-occupation; recent news of a life-threatening condition, for example.

●	See how the imagery of the view informs the subtext. Yew trees and graveyards have begun that process from the start.

Examples 78.3

●	Does the other character begin to suspect that there is something wrong?

●	A possible change for the character with the ‘unspoken pre-occupa- tion’ might be: the beginnings of an acceptance of death.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze the example answers and draw lessons from them.

Example 78.1:

The examples provided suggest various preoccupations for the characters. In the scene we wrote, Jia is preoccupied with a recent job loss. The lesson here is to consider different possibilities for the character's preoccupation that can affect the mood and language during the conversation.

Example 78.2:

The examples emphasize the importance of imagery from the view in informing the subtext. In our scene, the imagery of the trees, river, and factories serve as the backdrop for the conversation, which in turn connects to Jia's preoccupation with their job loss. The lesson here is to find and utilize the imagery from the original conversation to inform the subtext of the new scene.

Example 78.3:

The examples explore how the other character might suspect something is wrong and how the preoccupied character might experience a change in their feelings. In our scene, Lin might notice Jia's preoccupation and attempt to comfort them. Jia, in turn, might begin to accept their job loss and consider new possibilities. The lesson here is to focus on how the conversation affects both characters, considering the underlying emotions and changes that occur in each character.

Overall, the main lessons from these examples are:

1. Consider different preoccupations for the characters that can inform the subtext of the conversation.

2. Use the imagery from the original conversation to inform the subtext and develop the scene.

3. Focus on how the conversation affects the characters, exploring underlying emotions and changes that occur during the scene.

Outcome

You  have now written a scene in which, seemingly, nothing happens.   You  are in good company. When Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot   first performed in London, in 1955, one of the (many) hostile critics said, ‘Nothing happens. Twice.’ Come to think of it, the situation in the exam- ple – two unknown people looking at a view – is not dissimilar to the     one Beckett presents us with. The scene he sets is simply: A country  road. A tree. Evening. We meet two tramps waiting for someone. By the end of the play they are still there and they are still waiting. I suspect    that why the play, when first seen, was attacked was because it was   seen as ‘breaking all the rules’. I have already quoted the advice to,  ‘never allow a character to leave a scene the same as  when  they  entered it’. Waiting for Godot is a play in which two characters leave a  whole play in exactly the same circumstances as when they entered it.  But the point is, rules are there to be broken – but we can break them  only if we know them inside-out. Beckett certainly knew ‘the rules’ (or     the underlying principles of classic dramatic structure), being a classi-    cal scholar, and it was because of this that he was able to write the ‘anti- classic’ play. Which is a good moment to begin to discuss structure: the task – mentioned earlier – of ‘the solid carpentry of imparting informa-   tion and laying fuses’.

assistant: The outcome mentioned here highlights the importance of understanding the rules of traditional storytelling and dramatic structure, even when it seems like "nothing happens" in a scene. Samuel Beckett's play, Waiting for Godot, is used as an example of a play that seemingly breaks the rules, but Beckett's knowledge of classical dramatic structure allows him to create a compelling and thought-provoking work.

Waiting for Godot features two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who spend the entire play waiting for someone named Godot, who never arrives. The play consists of two acts, and as the critic mentioned, "nothing happens" in both acts. However, the play explores themes of existentialism, the human condition, and the search for meaning in life, making it a powerful piece of theater.

The key lesson here is that understanding the rules of dramatic structure allows a writer to break or bend them to create a unique and impactful story. While it is essential to know the principles of character development, conflict, and resolution, exceptional writers can use this knowledge to create stories that challenge the norms.

For example, a writer might create a scene where two friends discuss their favorite movies while sitting on a park bench. On the surface, it seems like nothing is happening, but as the conversation unfolds, the audience learns about the characters' dreams, fears, and regrets. The scene may not have a traditional dramatic arc, but it still provides insight into the characters and their relationships.

In summary, understanding the rules of storytelling and dramatic structure is essential, even when writing scenes where "nothing happens." By knowing these rules, a writer can challenge conventional storytelling techniques and create powerful, thought-provoking works that resonate with audiences.

user: assess the outcome in Li mei's story

assistant: In Li Mei's story, the scene where "nothing happens" could involve Li Mei and a friend or family member looking out at a view, discussing seemingly mundane topics. However, the subtext of the conversation reveals Li Mei's preoccupation with her upcoming decision to leave her job and pursue her dreams, even though it is not explicitly stated.

Outcome:

Through this scene, the writer has crafted a moment that appears ordinary on the surface but is rich with subtext and character development. The conversation between Li Mei and the other character subtly reveals their thoughts, fears, and aspirations, providing insight into their personalities and relationships. The scene may not have a traditional dramatic arc, but it still adds depth to the story and engages the reader.

The subtle approach to exploring Li Mei's concerns and emotions allows the reader to connect with her character on a deeper level. It emphasizes the idea that profound moments can be found in everyday situations, and it showcases the writer's skill in creating impactful scenes even when it seems like "nothing happens."

Furthermore, this scene demonstrates the importance of understanding storytelling and dramatic structure rules to create a unique and compelling narrative. By recognizing and working within these rules, the writer can effectively convey Li Mei's story and develop a powerful piece of writing that resonates with readers.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Exercise 90 If walls could speak

Participants: Primary

1	Think about your school: its age and history, what happens in it, the types of spaces in it, its surroundings, the sorts of people in it, etc. Think about what it is like at different times of the day and night. Make drawings of it. Take photographs of it.

2	Think of your school as a person. It can think, feel and speak. Like you it has different moods, memories and hopes, etc.

3	Using your research, write a speech for your school. Is it happy or sad? What does it feel about you? What are its good memories and  its bad memories? (See Example 90.1.)

4	Write a scene where someone in the school is able to talk to it.   No one else can do this, or knows about this. In the scene, the school is worried about something and is asking for advice. (See Example 90.2.)

5	In Example 90.1 the school took its revenge on the door-slammers by breaking the computers. Write a scene where the school gets involved in any of these: bullying, the Xmas play, racial harassment, sports day, community relations, etc.

6	Think of other places you know. What would they sound like if they could speak? What sort of things would they be interested in or want to get involved in?

assistant: Exercise 90 If walls could speak

Participants: Primary

1	Think about Li Mei's fashion design school in Hangzhou: its age and history, what happens in it, the types of spaces in it, its surroundings, the sorts of people in it, etc. Think about what it is like at different times of the day and night. Make drawings of it. Take photographs of it.

2	Think of Li Mei's fashion design school as a person. It can think, feel and speak. Like you it has different moods, memories and hopes, etc.

3	Using your research, write a speech for the fashion design school. Is it happy or sad? What does it feel about Li Mei and her friends? What are its good memories and its bad memories? (See Example 90.1.)

Example 90.1:

"I am the fashion design school, a place where dreams are woven, and ideas come to life. I have seen many students pass through my doors, each with their unique talents and aspirations. Li Mei is one of them, a girl with passion and dedication, and I feel proud to be a part of her journey. I cherish the moments when creativity flows within my walls and regret the times when conflict arises between the students. But overall, I am a place of growth and inspiration."

4	Write a scene where Li Mei is able to talk to the fashion design school. No one else can do this, or knows about this. In the scene, the school is worried about something and is asking for advice. (See Example 90.2.)

Example 90.2:

Li Mei sat in the empty classroom, sketching designs for her latest project. Suddenly, she heard a soft voice.

Fashion Design School: "Li Mei, I'm worried about the upcoming fashion show. There's so much pressure on the students, and I fear it may affect their mental health."

Li Mei, surprised but calm, replied, "I understand your concerns, but we all knew the challenges we'd face in this industry. Perhaps you could remind the teachers to offer more support and encouragement to the students during this time."

5	In Example 90.1 the school took its revenge on the door-slammers by breaking the computers. Write a scene where the school gets involved in any of these: bullying, the Xmas play, racial harassment, sports day, community relations, etc.

Example:

Li Mei and Wu Yue were in the hallway, and they witnessed a fellow student being bullied because of her ethnicity. The fashion design school, sensing the distress, intervened by making an announcement over the PA system.

Fashion Design School: "Attention, students! This school is a place of creativity, learning, and inclusivity. We will not tolerate any form of bullying or harassment. Please treat each other with respect and kindness."

6	Think of other places Li Mei knows. What would they sound like if they could speak? What sort of things would they be interested in or want to get involved in?

Example:

The small village where Li Mei grew up could speak of tradition, family values, and the beauty of nature. It might be interested in preserving cultural heritage, promoting eco-friendly practices, and fostering a sense of community among its residents.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

By bringing a familiar location alive, the exercise invites the writers to think of ‘the place the story happens in’ as a character. It can intervene in events (making the electricity fail and breaking the computers), or comment on the behaviour of the ‘real’ characters (making a mess with paint, not bothering about the dirt). It also provides great opportunities for bringing social issues and research projects alive. The use of the location as a char- acter allows difficult or contentious issues to be voiced in a safe way.

assistant: The outcome of Exercise 90 allows writers to explore the concept of personifying a location, in this case, Li Mei's fashion design school. By giving the location human-like characteristics, thoughts, and feelings, the writer can create a deeper connection between the setting and the story's characters. This personification can provide an interesting narrative device and allows the writer to delve into social issues or events happening within the story in a unique and engaging way.

For example, in the scene where the fashion design school addresses bullying over the PA system, the personification of the school allows the writer to address a serious social issue (bullying) in a creative and safe manner. Instead of having a teacher or another student intervene, the school itself takes action, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment within its walls.

Similarly, when the school is concerned about the mental health of its students due to the upcoming fashion show, it creates a new dimension to the story, allowing the writer to explore the pressures faced by students in the fashion industry. By having Li Mei give advice to the school, the writer can show her empathy and understanding of the challenges faced by her peers.

In summary, personifying a location in the story helps the writer create a richer narrative, engage with social issues or events, and establish a deeper connection between the setting and the characters. It also offers an unconventional and imaginative approach to storytelling that can captivate the reader's attention.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

LOCATION AS STORY-EVENT

The location and what is happening to it, or in it, can provide the basis for a whole story, determining the actions of all the characters. The story of The Titanic is a perfect example: a ship hits an iceberg and sinks, and many people drown. There are many individual stories within the big event, but the major story and main character is the location itself. Here is an exer- cise that explores how what is happening to, or in, a location can impact on the lives of all the characters.

assistant: The concept of "location as story-event" means that the location itself or the events happening within it serve as the central focus of the story, driving the narrative and influencing the actions of the characters. In such stories, the location is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the story, shaping the individual stories of the characters and often playing a crucial role in the overall narrative.

An example of this concept is the classic story of "The Titanic." In this story, the location (the ship) and the event (hitting an iceberg and sinking) are the central focus. The Titanic's journey and its eventual sinking determine the actions of all the characters on board, from the captain and crew to the passengers. While there are many individual stories within this larger narrative (such as the romance between Jack and Rose), the main character is essentially the location itself - the ship and the tragic events that unfold within it.

Another example can be found in the disaster movie "The Day After Tomorrow." In this story, the location (Earth) and the event (an extreme climate change causing a series of natural disasters) are the primary focus. The characters' actions and decisions are directly influenced by the catastrophic events happening around them. As the world faces an impending ice age, the characters must adapt and work together to survive the harsh conditions.

In both examples, the location and the events happening within it serve as the central element of the story, determining how the characters react and interact with one another. By focusing on the location as the primary driver of the narrative, the writer can create a compelling story that highlights the impact of the environment on the characters and their individual journeys.

user: give two examples of Li mei's story.

assistant: Example 1: The Fashion Show Disaster

In this example, the location is a prestigious fashion show event in Hangzhou, where Li Mei has been given an opportunity to showcase her designs. The event itself becomes the central focus of the story as Li Mei, her friends, and her mentor prepare for the big day. However, a series of unexpected obstacles occur at the venue, such as a power outage, a sabotaged runway, and missing wardrobe items. The characters must navigate these challenges while still trying to put on a successful show.

In this scenario, the location (the fashion show) and the events happening within it (the unexpected obstacles) become the driving force behind the characters' actions. Li Mei's determination to overcome these challenges and her friends' support demonstrates their resilience and teamwork. The location and its challenges ultimately shape the individual stories of the characters and the overall narrative.

Example 2: The Village Reunion

In this example, the location is Li Mei's small village, where she returns for a family reunion after achieving success as a fashion designer in Hangzhou. The village and its traditions are the central focus of the story as Li Mei struggles to reconcile her new life in the city with her roots in the village. During her stay, she discovers that the village is facing several challenges, such as a dying local textile industry and a fading sense of community.

In this case, the location (the village) and the events happening within it (the challenges faced by the village) become the driving force behind the characters' actions. Li Mei decides to use her skills as a designer to revive the village's textile industry and bring the community together. Her friends and mentor support her in this endeavor, helping her reconnect with her roots and make a positive impact on her hometown.

In both examples, the locations and the events happening within them serve as the central elements of the story, determining how the characters react and interact with one another. By focusing on the locations as the primary drivers of the narrative, Li Mei's story highlights the impact of the environment on her personal journey and the lives of those around her.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Exercise 91 On this day

Participants: All groups, individual

1	What you are going to write will take place in your locality or community. This could be a city, town, village, school, etc.

2	Think of a public event that happened in the locality or community. It will be an event that everyone in the locality or community will be aware of, even if they had not been directly involved in it. (See Examples 91.1.)

3	Everyone in the locality or community will have been affected by or involved in the event in any number of ways: physically, emotionally, economically, spiritually, etc. It will be something that everyone has some form of opinion about. The narratives you are going to write will all take place on the day of the event.

4	Draw a large circle. Inside it, draw nine concentric circles. They will get smaller and smaller, like onion-rings.

5	The smallest circle (C1), at the centre, is the event that took place. If your story takes place here, the characters will have been directly involved in the event in one way or another. If your story takes place on the largest circle (C10), the outer one, the lives of the characters

will have been marginally involved in the event. But even so, it will have had some effect on them, in some way.

6	The other circles (C2–C9) are all somewhere on the scale between ‘directly involved’ and ‘marginally involved’.

7	Choose whereabouts on the scale of C1–C10 your story is set.

8	Decide upon a person who would have been in the location or com- munity at the time of the event. Using all the work done so far, create a thumbnail back-story for them.

9	Decide where your protagonist is on the day of the event, and what they are doing. Where they are on the scale will suggest possibilities.

10	Bearing in mind where on the C1–C10 scale the protagonists are, write short outlines (two or three sentences) or beginnings of dramatic narratives. Try different points on the scale. (See Examples 91.2.)

11	Develop the scenario of one of the narratives. In terms of where the story is on the scale, does this begin to make things more complex? (See Example 91.3.)

12	Develop the scenario into scenes or a full play, depending upon the amount of time you have. How are the lives of the protagonists affected, changed, altered, shaped, hindered, etc., by the event?

13	Create (as an individual or a group) a sequence of short narratives placed ‘on this day’, giving a wide picture of how a whole locality or community was affected by the event.

assistant: 1. Event: A major fashion show competition in Hangzhou where Li Mei is participating with her designs.

2. & 3. As this event is a significant moment for Li Mei's career, everyone in her community is aware of it, and they are affected or involved in various ways, emotionally, economically, and socially. The narratives will all take place on the day of the fashion show.

4. & 5. Draw the large circle with nine concentric circles. The smallest circle (C1) represents Li Mei and her direct involvement in the event, while the largest circle (C10) represents the people who are marginally involved.

6. & 7. Choose the scale for each character:

- Li Jilai (Li Mei's father): C3

- Wu Yue: C2

- Chen Ying: C2

- Zhang Wei: C3

- Professor Liu: C1

8. Create a thumbnail back-story for Li Jilai, Li Mei's father, who comes from a traditional background and has always been strict with Li Mei. He is torn between his pride in Li Mei's achievements and his concerns about her career choice in the fashion industry.

9. Li Jilai is at home on the day of the event, unable to decide whether to attend the fashion show or not.

10. Short outlines for each character on the day of the event:

- Li Jilai struggles with his emotions and ultimately decides to attend the fashion show to support Li Mei.

- Wu Yue helps Li Mei backstage with last-minute preparations, offering emotional support.

- Chen Ying attends the event with her husband, cheering Li Mei on from the audience.

- Zhang Wei surprises Li Mei by showing up at the event, despite having a busy work schedule.

- Professor Liu gives Li Mei words of encouragement and advice before the fashion show begins.

11. Developing the scenario of Li Jilai attending the event adds complexity to the story, as it showcases the emotional journey of a traditional father supporting his daughter's unconventional career choice.

12. Develop the scenes or full play showing how each character is affected by the event. Include moments where they support Li Mei, their reactions to her success or failure in the competition, and how their relationships with Li Mei evolve because of the event.

13. The sequence of short narratives placed "on this day" would show the wide picture of how Li Mei's community is affected by the event: from her father's emotional struggle, her friends' support, her lover's surprise appearance, to her mentor's guidance. Each narrative would highlight the various ways the fashion show event has impacted the lives of the people around Li Mei.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city.

4. During the traditional Chinese festival, Li Mei receives news that Zhang Wei has been in an accident. She must decide whether to continue with her fashion showcase or rush to be with Zhang Wei (C3).

5. While Li Mei and her friends are organizing the charity fashion show, Chen Ying learns that her husband is having an affair. She contemplates whether to confront him or focus on supporting Li Mei's event (C10).

user: Please also change this.

Example 91.3

The young girl has been preparing for the Mela for weeks. She and her friends have been practising traditional song, which they will perform at the event. That morning, her pet dog is run over by a car and dies. Her friends tell her that they will make a ceremony and bury the dog in the evening, but the girl does not want to delay it that long. Despite the per- suasions of her friends, and her own desire to be at the Mela, she decides that she will remain alone. She questions the nature of loyalty, friendship and community. Although she is not now directly involved with the event (C10), her decision to not be a part of it has raised fundamental questions for her (C1).

assistant: Example 91.3 for Li Mei's story:

Li Mei has been working tirelessly on a special dress for the upcoming Lunar New Year celebration. Her friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, are excited to accompany her to the event. However, on the day of the celebration, Li Mei's grandmother falls seriously ill. Her father, Li Jilai, insists that she stay at home to take care of her grandmother.

Despite her passion for fashion and her eagerness to attend the celebration, Li Mei decides to stay at home, putting her family first (C10). This decision leads her to question the balance between her personal dreams, family obligations, and the expectations of her community (C1).

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example in the context of Li Mei's story.

assistant: Outcome:

By doing the "On this day" exercise in the context of Li Mei's story, we explored how a specific event in Li Mei's community could impact her life and the lives of those around her. The exercise allowed us to delve into Li Mei's character development and the relationships she has with her friends and family.

Example:

In Li Mei's story, we used the Lunar New Year celebration as the significant event in her community. This event is something everyone in her locality is aware of and excited to participate in. Li Mei, who dreams of becoming a top fashion designer, is directly involved in the event as she has been working on a special dress for the occasion.

However, when her grandmother falls seriously ill on the day of the celebration, Li Mei has to make a tough decision. She chooses to prioritize her family and stay at home to take care of her grandmother (C10), despite her own dreams and the expectations of her friends.

This decision leads her to question the balance between her personal dreams, family obligations, and the expectations of her community (C1). Through this example, we see how the event in Li Mei's community affects her life and the lives of those around her, such as her friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying, who were excited to attend the celebration with her. The event also deepens her relationship with her father, Li Jilai, as she demonstrates her commitment to their family.

By incorporating the Lunar New Year celebration into Li Mei's story, we created a more complex and engaging narrative that explores Li Mei's character and the various aspects of her life.

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

You have used the ‘location-event’ as a framing dramatic moment for the story. In doing so you have explored how the environment a story takes place in can be an active driving force, not just a background.

assistant: Assessment:

In the context of Li Mei's story, the 'location-event' exercise has successfully allowed us to use the Lunar New Year celebration as a pivotal moment in the narrative. This event serves as more than just a backdrop for the story, as it actively influences Li Mei's decisions and relationships with the other characters.

By focusing on how Li Mei's community and environment shape her experiences, we gain a deeper understanding of her character and the challenges she faces. The use of the Lunar New Year celebration as a framing device highlights the importance of cultural context in Li Mei's life and adds depth to her story.

In conclusion, the outcome of this exercise is successful as it demonstrates how a location-event can be an active driving force in a story, providing a rich narrative framework that engages readers and helps them connect with the characters and their experiences.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city.

Exercise 92 The five places Part one

Participants: All groups – drama activity into writing

1	Work individually at first. Find your own place in the room. Close your eyes for a few moments.

2	When you open your eyes you will be on the top of a high mountain. Look around you. What do you see? What is the temperature? What are you feeling? Don’t attempt ‘acting’ or showing what you are think- ing and feeling; keep the process very internal. Close your eyes.

3	When you open your eyes you will be in a great meadow of grass.

Think of the questions. Close your eyes.

4	When you open your eyes you will be in a dark forest. Same process.

5	When you open your eyes you will be on a busy street corner. Same process.

6	When you open your eyes you will be in a prison cell. Same process.

7	Go through all the steps again. This time you can (a) sit, lie down, crouch, etc., depending on how you are feeling and (b) express your feelings in words each time you are in a new place.

8	Now work in groups of five.

9	Create a group tableau for each place, giving a strong physical feel- ing of the atmosphere, mood, etc. Add in all the words for each stage of the journey.

10	Write out the words for each stage of the journey. Decide on the order of the lines. How are they best put together to capture the feeling of each place?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's explore how Li Mei experiences different places through her perspective.

1. Work individually, imagining Li Mei's thoughts and feelings as she experiences each location.

2. Li Mei opens her eyes and finds herself on top of a high mountain. She sees the vast, beautiful landscape stretching out before her, with distant villages and the city of Hangzhou on the horizon. The temperature is chilly, and the wind is blowing gently. Li Mei feels a sense of freedom, inspiration, and a longing for her dreams of being a top fashion designer.

3. Next, Li Mei opens her eyes to find herself in a great meadow of grass. She sees a peaceful, picturesque scene with flowers and butterflies. The sun is shining warmly on her face. Li Mei feels a sense of comfort and nostalgia, reminiscent of her childhood in the small village.

4. Li Mei opens her eyes and finds herself in a dark forest. The environment is mysterious and slightly frightening, with shadows and strange noises surrounding her. She feels uncertain, as if she's lost and needs to find her way back to the path that leads to her dreams.

5. When Li Mei opens her eyes, she is on a busy street corner in Hangzhou. She sees fashionable people, shops, and the hustle and bustle of the city. She feels excited, motivated, and a bit overwhelmed, as she imagines herself being a part of this world as a successful designer.

6. Finally, Li Mei opens her eyes to find herself in a prison cell. The space is confined and oppressive, symbolizing the strict expectations of her father and societal norms. She feels trapped and suffocated, longing for the freedom to pursue her dreams.

7. Go through all the steps again, considering Li Mei's body language, facial expressions, and verbal reactions to each location.

8. Now, work in groups of five, each person representing Li Mei in one of the locations.

9. Create a group tableau for each place, illustrating the atmosphere, mood, and Li Mei's emotions in each setting.

10. Write out the words for each stage of the journey. Decide on the order of the lines, capturing the feeling of each place. This could be transformed into a poem or a monologue from Li Mei's perspective, expressing her emotions and experiences in each location.

Outcome

Through a simple drama/devising activity, it is possible to build a narrative that explores how location can impact on the journey of a character. In the example given, nature inspires the character, it advises him, it punishes him. The urban landscape ignores him, then turns on him. The place of

confinement at the end leads him to escape the world, just as he had intended on the mountain.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, using the five places as the key episodes in her journey, we can see how each location significantly impacts her decisions, actions, and emotions. The locations influence her journey towards becoming a top fashion designer in Hangzhou, China.

1. Mountain (Inspiration): At the top of the mountain, Li Mei feels a strong sense of inspiration and determination to pursue her dream of becoming a top fashion designer. The beautiful and vast landscape motivates her to leave her small village and move to the city to study fashion and chase her ambitions. The mountain represents the beginning of her journey and the moment she commits to her dream.

2. Meadow (Support and Gratitude): In the great meadow of grass, Li Mei reminisces about her childhood and the support of her best friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying. The meadow symbolizes her connection to her roots and the importance of friendship and support in her journey. The tranquil and comforting setting of the meadow reminds her of the valuable relationships in her life, and she decides to maintain contact with her friends while pursuing her career.

3. Dark Forest (Challenges and Guidance): The dark forest represents the obstacles and challenges Li Mei faces in her journey, such as her strict father's disapproval and the competitive nature of the fashion industry. The forest is a metaphor for the difficulties she encounters along the way. Feeling lost and uncertain, Li Mei seeks guidance from her mentor, Professor Liu, who helps her navigate the challenges and overcome them.

4. Busy Street Corner (Motivation and Hard Work): On the busy street corner in Hangzhou, Li Mei is exposed to the vibrant fashion scene and the bustling energy of the city. This location represents her motivation to work hard and stand out in the competitive industry. Inspired by her love for Zhang Wei and her passion for fashion, Li Mei dedicates herself to creating a unique fashion collection that reflects her identity and heritage.

5. Prison Cell (Breaking Free from Constraints): The prison cell symbolizes Li Mei's feelings of being trapped by societal norms and expectations. The confinement of the cell represents the limitations and expectations imposed by her family and society. However, this final location ultimately leads her to break free from these constraints, allowing her to embrace her true passions and achieve her dream of becoming a top fashion designer.

The locations in Li Mei's journey play a crucial role in shaping her character, decisions, and actions. From nature's inspiration to urban challenges and confinement, each location serves as a milestone in her journey and helps her grow and evolve as a person.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city.

Exercise 93 Mapping the locality

Participants: All groups – drama activity into writing

1	On separate sheets of paper write down, or draw, key locations in  your area. Go for a good range and variety of public spaces and build- ings, shops and markets, landmarks, etc.

2	Place these on the floor, making a map of the area.

3	Suggest types of characters who might be found in the area, where they could be and what they might be doing. These can be people you actually see in the area, and fictional characters. Give them an occupation or an activity in the area. (See Examples 93.1.)

4	Take a character and give them a 24-hour journey through the  area. Where would they be at particular times? What would they  be doing? Go for quite low-key, everyday activities, but remember that people can often have surprising aspects to them. (See Examples 93.2.)

5	Walk the characters through the floor map of the area. Where are they at certain times of the day? Which characters are at or near the same location at certain times of the day? How might they meet and what would occur at that meeting? Ask the characters to talk about their  lives. Ask the characters questions. (See Examples 93.3.)

6	Give the characters the following: (a) a strong personal memory  linked to a location in the area, (b) something like about the area,

(b)	something they dislike about the area. (See Examples 93.4.)

7	On the basis of steps 5 and 6, what possible dramatic narratives emerge? Try and relate them to the locations. (See Examples 93.5.)

8	See if the stories begin to link up with each other.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

In all narratives, the location is alive with possibilities: the impact of memory, necessity, chance, etc. Consider how – if you have a variety of locations in your play – these may operate on your characters. How differently do they behave in different locations?

assistant: In Li Mei's story, different locations play a significant role in shaping her experiences, interactions, and growth as a character. Each location is infused with memories, emotions, and opportunities that influence her thoughts and actions.

For example, consider the fashion school where Li Mei studies. This location is crucial for her development as a fashion designer, as it is where she learns new skills and gains inspiration from her peers and mentors. In this environment, Li Mei is driven, creative, and ambitious, working tirelessly to achieve her dreams.

The local market, where Li Mei often has lunch with her friend Wu Yue, is another important location. Here, the bustling atmosphere and rich cultural heritage of Hangzhou are on full display. The market serves as a source of inspiration and a reminder of the diverse city she now calls home. In this setting, Li Mei is more relaxed and open, engaging in conversation and bonding with her friends.

When Li Mei visits Chen Ying's home, she is exposed to a different aspect of life in the city. Chen Ying is a beautiful housewife, living a life that contrasts with Li Mei's aspirations. In this location, Li Mei is contemplative and introspective, reflecting on her choices and the path she has chosen to follow.

Lastly, the small village where Li Mei grew up holds a special place in her heart. The memories of her childhood and the traditional expectations of her family weigh heavily on her, shaping her identity and ambitions. In this location, Li Mei might feel a mix of nostalgia, determination, and pressure, as she tries to reconcile her past with her future aspirations.

These different locations in Li Mei's story create a dynamic narrative, allowing her character to evolve and adapt as she navigates through various environments. By considering the impact of each location on Li Mei's thoughts, feelings, and actions, the story becomes richer, more engaging, and more reflective of the complexity of human experience.

7	The individual voice

‘Afternoons seem unending on branch-line stations in England  in summer time.’

(From A Wreath of Roses, by Elizabeth Taylor, first published by Richard

Clay and Company, UK 1949)

The quote is not from a play, but is the opening line from a story by the English novelist Elizabeth Taylor. It is a fine example of how a writer can use words to cast a bright new light on the mundane and familiar. An examina- tion of the phrase – the placing of the words, the rhythm of the words, the punctuation – shows that the author constructed it with as much care as the composer of a piece of music placing the notes on the page. A brief descrip- tion of a moment in time, it has no internal punctuation but rolls itself out along a sequence of lazy, open vowels towards the final full stop. The plac- ing of ‘on’, ‘in’ and ‘in’ add to the tangible sense of time going on forever. For me, it is one of those phrases that puts into words something I have experienced (waiting on a deserted country station in the hot summer for the train that never comes) in a manner that sums up the essence of that experi- ence. The writer’s individual voice, the value she placed on the words, gave verbal expression to a feeling I recognised, a thought I didn’t know I had.

It must have been like that when people in sixteenth-century England heard – for the first time – thoughts uttered in speeches beginning with ‘To be, or not to be, that is the question’ and ‘Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day’. When Masha, in The Seagull, says ‘I am in mourning for my life’, she similarly expresses in words some intangible and melancholy feelings many of us have had at some time in our lives: the pointlessness of it all. When Noel Coward talks about the potency of cheap music, he is acknowledging the force with which a bril- liant popular lyric can put into words something we have all felt, be it Edith

Piaf saying she regrets nothing or Frank Sinatra declaring he did it his way. It’s the ‘Ah yes’ factor. ‘Ah yes, that’s exactly how it is.’

From the complex philosophical broodings of Shakespeare to the great modern lyricist, the individual writer can articulate for us our own thoughts and feelings. This must surely be the aspiration of anyone who puts pen to paper, or finger to keyboard: to capture in words a personal expression of thought or feeling that translates into a universal expression of the same. How?

This is the one aspect of writing that cannot be taught, and it is the most crucial one, without which all the questions of form and structure are hollow and mechanistic: how you discover your own individual voice through the way you use words. In this chapter I will be offering ways in which this aspect of the craft – if it cannot be ‘taught’ – can be encouraged. In the play you are writing, you are creating a world that may seem familiar in its outward form (modern social drama, for example), or a new world that is unfamiliar in its outward form (historical, absurdist or futuris- tic drama, for example). Your task is to express the world you are depicting in a way that is unique to you, but which will re-create any of those worlds in a way that we believe in them utterly. None of them will be ‘real’. The world of John Osborne’s Look Back In Anger (Nottingham sweet-seller in the 1950s UK) is no more ‘real’ than Tennessee William’s Camino Real (fictional literary characters trapped in an unnamed banana republic in the 1950s). What marks both plays out is their use of language. The language summons up the essence of the time/place of the story, but it is essentially the language of the poet. No one in Nottingham in the 1950s actually spoke like Jimmy Porter in Osborne’s play. No one trapped in a banana republic in the 1950s would speak like Casanova in Tennessee William’s play. What makes the plays great is that we believe that this is ‘real’. That is what we must aspire to. If we do not, we might create a ‘well-made play’ crafted according to solid principles, but it will not be telling us anything new. It might make money, of course: Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap has been playing its wooden dia- logue in London’s West End for nearly as many years as I have been alive, and it only tells us who did the murder. There is no music in the language,

or if there is, it is a very dull tune we have heard before.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the individual voice refers to the unique way the writer expresses the thoughts, emotions, and experiences of Li Mei and other characters in the story. The individual voice is essential for capturing the essence of the world the writer creates, making it relatable and believable for the readers or audience, even if the dialogue or situations may not be entirely realistic.

For example, Li Mei's interactions with her strict father, Li Jilai, could be written in a way that captures the essence of their relationship and the cultural expectations that shape it. The dialogue between them might not be an exact representation of a real-life conversation, but the way it is expressed should evoke emotions and thoughts that resonate with the audience. The writer's individual voice can bring the unique aspects of their relationship to life, making it relatable and engaging.

Similarly, when portraying the friendship between Li Mei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying, the writer can use their individual voice to explore the dynamics of their friendship, their personal struggles, and their dreams. The conversations between them might be infused with humor, wit, and insight, reflecting their personalities and the bond they share. The writer's unique voice can highlight the nuances of their friendship, making it feel authentic and compelling.

In summary, the individual voice is an essential aspect of storytelling that cannot be taught but can be developed and encouraged. It is the writer's unique expression of thoughts, feelings, and experiences that brings the story and its characters to life, creating a world that feels real and resonates with the audience. In Li Mei's story, the individual voice can be used to explore the relationships, emotions, and cultural context of her journey, making it a captivating and memorable narrative.

LANGUAGE AS MUSIC

We  have already talked about how any good actor will instinctively take      to a script in which the placing of the words and the rhythms of the dia- logue are fresh and original. They will be interested in plot, character- development, etc., but their actor’s imagination will be primarily engaged with the words you have chosen for them to speak. You may be writing in

a style that draws upon the language of the streets, or in a heightened poetic style. In either case the actor will know if you have placed value on the way you have laid the words down, or if the words are merely a vehicle to advance the plot. Actors will speak of the ‘musicality’ of the text and they are being very precise here, for they are talking about the exact plac- ing of the words on the page (and therefore the weight given to them, and the punctuation). Before engaging in any practical writing work, it will be useful to take some proven plays and see what we make of this.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, language as music refers to the way the writer constructs dialogue and descriptions with a sense of rhythm, pacing, and careful word choice that makes the text engaging and enjoyable for both the actors and the audience. By treating language as music, the writer can create a script that is not only effective in conveying the story but also enjoyable for the actors to perform and the audience to experience.

For example, let's consider a scene where Li Mei is discussing her dreams of becoming a top fashion designer with her best friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying. The writer could create a musicality in the dialogue by using a blend of natural, conversational language and poetic expressions that convey the characters' emotions and aspirations.

Li Mei: (Excited) I dream of the day when my designs grace the runways of Hangzhou, a symphony of colors, fabrics, and styles that dance in the city lights. (Pauses, looks at her friends) But I know, it's a steep climb from the village to the top.

Wu Yue: (Supportive) Li Mei, your talent is like a river, flowing with creativity, unstoppable. The city will embrace you, and your designs will shine brighter than the stars.

Chen Ying: (Nods) We believe in you, Li Mei. As your friends, we'll be there every step of the way, cheering you on as you chase your dreams.

In this example, the dialogue has a musical quality, with the characters using vivid imagery and poetic language to express their thoughts and emotions. The rhythm and pacing of the dialogue also contribute to the musicality, with pauses and changes in tone that create a dynamic and engaging conversation.

By focusing on language as music, the writer can create a script that captures the essence of Li Mei's story and her relationships with her friends, while also providing a satisfying and enjoyable experience for the actors and the audience. The musicality of the text can help convey the emotions, dreams, and aspirations of the characters, making the story more impactful and memorable.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store.

assistant: Exercise: Analyzing the musicality of the dialogue in Li Mei's story

1. Choose a scene from Li Mei's story. For this exercise, let's select a scene where Li Mei is having a confrontation with her rival, Huang Shan, at a fashion event in the city.

2. Read through the dialogue and take note of the rhythm, pacing, and word choice. Consider how these elements contribute to the musicality of the text.

Li Mei: (Frustrated) Huang Shan, you may have had success with your traditional qipao store, but I won't let you overshadow my dreams.

Huang Shan: (Smirking) Oh, Li Mei, your village upbringing shines through your designs. You'll need more than dreams to compete with me.

Li Mei: (Determined) My roots are my strength, and they inspire my creativity. I will show the world that my designs are a perfect blend of tradition and innovation.

Huang Shan: (Dismissive) We'll see, Li Mei. Just remember, the city can be ruthless. You might find that your dreams are not enough to succeed here.

3. Identify moments in the dialogue where the language is poetic or vivid, and how it enhances the emotions and tensions between the characters.

- In this scene, both Li Mei and Huang Shan use poetic language to express their determination and rivalry. For example, Li Mei mentions her "roots" as her strength, and Huang Shan refers to Li Mei's "village upbringing" as a weakness.

4. Consider how the rhythm and pacing of the dialogue contribute to the musicality and emotional impact of the scene.

- The dialogue alternates between short and longer sentences, creating a sense of tension and rhythm in the conversation. The pacing also reflects the emotions of the characters, with Li Mei's determined statements contrasting with Huang Shan's dismissive remarks.

5. Reflect on how the musicality of the dialogue helps to convey the essence of the story and the relationships between the characters.

- The musicality of the dialogue in this scene helps to emphasize the rivalry between Li Mei and Huang Shan, as well as the underlying themes of tradition versus innovation and village life versus city life. The poetic language and rhythm of the conversation create an engaging and emotionally charged exchange that highlights the characters' motivations and drives the story forward.

By analyzing the musicality of the dialogue in Li Mei's story, the writer can ensure that the script effectively conveys the emotions, conflicts, and relationships between the characters, while also providing an engaging and enjoyable experience for the actors and the audience.

Exercise 94 The placing of the word

Participants: All groups, individual

This is an exercise which actors and directors often use at the start of rehearsals, as part of the process of getting to grips with a text. It is not about character-development, etc., but more an examination of the poet- ics of the text. For writers it is equally useful as a means of experiencing how a skilled practitioner has chosen to lay out the words in a specific way.

1	Select a passage from the opening scene of any act in a play. It should preferably be one that is not known to you or to the group, so that there will be no preconceptions about it. (See Example 94.1.)

2	You are going to read through the passage.

3	Put aside any questions of who the characters are or what the story is.

4	Read the passage as a series of speeches unrelated to character. If you are working in a group read speech-by-speech around the circle. (See Example 94.2.)

5	Read the passage again. This time, read it as a series of thoughts. That is, each thought ends with the full stop. Again, if working in a group, read thought-by-thought around the circle. (See Example 94.3.)

6	Read through the passage. Draw a circle around all the major words or phrases that appear more than once, or words that belong in sim- ilar categories. Read them out giving each one its full weight. (See  Example 94.4.)

7	Take a scene from your own play and apply the same process to it.

assistant: Let's do the exercise with a passage from Li Mei's story.

Example 94.1:

LI MEI: I feel like I'm suffocating in this village. I need to spread my wings and chase my dreams in the city.

LI JILAI: You know nothing about the city, Li Mei. It's not easy out there. You should stay here, where it's safe.

WU YUE: Li Mei, I believe in you. You have the talent and passion to become a great fashion designer.

Example 94.2 (reading speech-by-speech):

I feel like I'm suffocating in this village.

You know nothing about the city, Li Mei.

Li Mei, I believe in you.

Example 94.3 (reading thought-by-thought):

I feel like I'm suffocating in this village.

I need to spread my wings and chase my dreams in the city.

You know nothing about the city, Li Mei.

It's not easy out there.

You should stay here, where it's safe.

Li Mei, I believe in you.

You have the talent and passion to become a great fashion designer.

Example 94.4 (circling major words or phrases):

suffocating, village, spread my wings, chase my dreams, city, know nothing, not easy, safe, believe, talent, passion, fashion designer

Now, let's apply the same process to a scene from your play:

[Insert a scene from your play here]

1. Read the passage as a series of speeches unrelated to character.

2. Read the passage as a series of thoughts, with each thought ending with a full stop.

3. Circle all the major words or phrases that appear more than once or belong to similar categories, and read them out, giving each one its full weight.

By doing this exercise, you'll get a better sense of the poetics and rhythm of the text in both the example passage and your own play, which can help you improve your writing and make it more engaging for the actors and the audience.

user: Please adapt these examples to Li mei's story.

Example 94.1

An opening scene

The SKIPPER, in a small pool of light. He has a small, battered tin globe, with all the time zones, meridians, etc., on it. He spins it. The OWNER enters.

Skipper: (pointing to the small, battered globe) Put your finger down, anywhere.

Bet your bottom dollar I’ve been there.

(He spins the globe. The OWNER puts his finger down)

Been there. Cancer, Capricorn, Equator, parallel. I’ve seen the lot.

Owner:	Safe home in harbour now.

Skipper: I’m not worn out yet. Nor me, nor boat. Owner:	She’s pooped.

Skipper: My boat? Owner:	My boat.

Skipper: Yours by property, mine by feeling. Owner:	Time’s up for that old tub.

Skipper: No . . . never.

Owner:	The firm recognises all you’ve done ... (hands him a package) You’ll have a tidy pension, too.

(The SKIPPER takes out a watch and chain from the package) We’re calling her in.

Skipper: And me? I’m to tick off my days? Owner:	Her time’s up.

Skipper: She’s not a boating-lake dinghy, with a ticket and a number . . . Owner:	Woodwork’s all gone to pot . . .

Skipper: A bit of care ...:

Owner:	Brasswork comes off in your hand . . . Skipper: Bit of love and affection . . .

Owner:	Money’s tight. Her days are done. Skipper: Like me?

Owner:	You’d never manage the new ships.

Skipper: I’ve seen them. That’s not ships. That’s floating factories, float- ing coffins.

Owner:	That’s the modern world. Brass and wood is history. Come round next month. You can supervise the breaking up.

Skipper: Break her?

Owner:	Strip her to the bone, sell off her parts. You’ll get a bonus. Skipper: Just one last sailing . . .

Owner:	Out of the question . . . Skipper: A short trip . . . anything.

Owner:	I might be owner, but I’ve shareholders to answer to. No. She’s had her day. She’s done. You too.

assistant: Example 94.1 adapted to Li Mei's story:

An opening scene

Li Mei, in a small room filled with fabric and designs. She works on a sketch of a qipao. Her father, Li Jilai, enters.

Li Mei: (pointing to her sketch) Look at this, father. This could be my next masterpiece.

Li Jilai: These designs won't bring food to the table. You should focus on something more practical.

Li Mei: But this is my passion. I want to make a difference in the world of fashion.

Example 94.2 adapted to Li Mei's story:

Reader One: Look at this, father. This could be my next masterpiece.

Reader Two: These designs won't bring food to the table.

Reader Three: But this is my passion. I want to make a difference in the world of fashion.

Example 94.3 adapted to Li Mei's story:

Reader One: Look at this, father.

Reader Two: This could be my next masterpiece.

Reader Three: These designs won't bring food to the table.

Reader Four: You should focus on something more practical.

Reader Five: But this is my passion. I want to make a difference in the world of fashion.

Example 94.4 adapted to Li Mei's story:

Masterpiece. Father. Designs. Food. Table. Practical. Passion. Difference. World. Fashion.

By adapting these examples to Li Mei's story, you can get a better understanding of the dialogue and its rhythm, which will help you create more engaging conversations and scenes for the characters in the story.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Assess the outcome in the story of Li Mei.

Outcome

At first glance, the passage might seem to be a casual, ‘realistic’ exchange. But  when  we  strip  away  the  layers,  we  discover  there  is a sequence of key ‘notes’ being struck, embedded in an overall ‘score’. The passage has been composed.

Actors who perform in Shakespeare will tell you that, if you respect the punctuation, you are halfway there. The ‘meaning’ of the text resides as much in the shape of the verse (its musicality), as in the intellectual dissection of the thought behind it.

assistant: In the story of Li Mei, the outcome can be assessed by examining the dialogue and the way it is structured, as well as the emotional beats and the characters' relationships. Let's consider the following exchange between Li Mei and her father, Li Jilai:

Li Mei: (excited) Father, I've been offered an internship at a prestigious fashion house in Hangzhou!

Li Jilai: (skeptical) That's good, but how will you support yourself? It's an expensive city.

Li Mei: (determined) I'll work hard, find a part-time job, and make the most of this opportunity.

At first glance, this dialogue may seem like a simple conversation between a daughter and her father. However, when we analyze it further, we can see that there is a sequence of key 'notes' being struck, reflecting the characters' emotions and their relationship dynamic.

1. Li Mei's excitement: This note reveals her passion for fashion and her ambition to succeed in the city.

2. Li Jilai's skepticism: This note conveys his concern for Li Mei's well-being, as well as his practical mindset.

3. Li Mei's determination: This note highlights her resolve to overcome the challenges she may face in pursuit of her dream.

These emotional beats contribute to the overall 'score' of the story, which encompasses the characters' emotions, relationships, and personal growth. The dialogue's musicality, or the rhythm of the language, helps convey these emotions and create a more engaging narrative.

When assessing the outcome in Li Mei's story, we can see that the dialogue and its structure serve to create a vivid and engaging portrayal of the characters and their emotions. By respecting the punctuation and the rhythm of the text, the actors can effectively convey the meaning behind the characters' words, bringing the story to life for the audience.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store.

Exercise 95 The sound of the word

Participants: All groups, individual

The words you choose to put into the mouths of your characters convey much more than information. Their very sound and shape might begin to summon up the mood and atmosphere of the play, the situation of the  moment and even character-type. The choice of hard/soft sounds, vow- els/consonants, short/long words.

1	Take some passages or scenes from different plays.

2	Note the location.

3	Note what the main action is.

4	Note what you identify as the mood/atmosphere of the passage or scene.

5	See if the types of words used – in their sound and structure – reflect in any way steps 2, 3 or 4.

6	See if the types of words used give an impression of the characters, what type of person they might be or what emotional state they are in at the moment.

assistant: For this exercise, let's create a short passage from Li Mei's story to analyze the sound and structure of the words used in the dialogue.

Scene: Li Mei's workshop, where she is working on a new design. Her friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, are visiting, and they discuss the upcoming fashion show.

Li Mei: (focused) I need to create a masterpiece for the fashion show. The qipao must be exquisite and original.

Wu Yue: (encouraging) Your talent is unmatched, Li Mei. You'll outshine Huang Shan for sure.

Chen Ying: (supportive) And remember, we'll be there to help and cheer you on!

1. Passages or scenes: Li Mei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying discussing Li Mei's designs and the upcoming fashion show.

2. Location: Li Mei's workshop in Hangzhou.

3. Main action: Li Mei is working on a new design, and her friends are offering their support and encouragement.

4. Mood/atmosphere: Determined, supportive, and optimistic.

5. Types of words used:

- Focused, determined words: "masterpiece," "exquisite," "unmatched."

- Supportive, optimistic words: "encouraging," "cheer you on," "outshine."

- Cultural context: "qipao," "Huang Shan."

6. Impression of the characters and their emotional state:

- Li Mei: Focused and determined, striving for perfection in her designs.

- Wu Yue: Encouraging and confident in Li Mei's abilities, wants her to succeed.

- Chen Ying: Supportive and positive, expressing her willingness to help and be there for Li Mei.

In this exercise, we can see how the choice of words and their sound and structure can convey not only the mood and atmosphere of the scene but also the emotional state and character traits of the individuals involved. By carefully selecting words, the dialogue helps to create a vivid and engaging portrayal of Li Mei and her friends' emotions and interactions.

user: Please adapt this example to Li mei's story.

Example 95.1 The Sea, by Edward Bond

The opening scene of this play is set on a beach; there is darkness, thun- der and a violent storm. The main action is the failure of one of the char- acters to rescue his friend from the water. The atmosphere is one of great confusion. Two characters, WILLY and EVANS speak over the tempest. WILLY is attempting to save someone from the sea. EVANS is drunk. Throughout the scene, WILLY uses words that tend to be short, hard and forceful: help, shout, god, water, boat, bastard, etc. EVANS uses words that are short, soft and weak: sing’ss, song, day’ss, wha’?, ‘ssea’sl, thass, wasser. The language being used therefore has more than one function. It tells us that WILLY is desperate and angry and that EVANS is drunk and bewildered; but beyond this the very sounds of the words mirror the ele- ments the men are thrown into: the violence of the storm.

assistant: Adapted example for Li Mei's story:

The opening scene of Li Mei's story is set in a traditional market in Hangzhou, with bustling crowds, vibrant colors, and various sounds. Li Mei is purchasing fabrics for her new designs, while her rival Huang Shan is arguing with a vendor. The atmosphere is busy and competitive. Li Mei and Huang Shan exchange a few words amid the chaos.

Li Mei uses words that are polite, focused, and elegant: "excuse me," "silk," "pattern," "inspiration," "beauty." Huang Shan uses words that are aggressive, demanding, and harsh: "discount," "worthless," "cheap," "now," "mine."

In this scene, the language used has more than one function. It tells us that Li Mei is respectful and passionate about her craft, while Huang Shan is assertive and more concerned with getting a good deal. Furthermore, the sounds of the words reflect the atmosphere of the market, highlighting the contrast between Li Mei's approach to fashion and Huang Shan's attitude.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Outcome

The word ‘change’ has come up a lot in the work we have been doing. In this exercise we have taken a whole scene apart to see where the major shifts of action, subject and mood are. The unit-titles all contained strong

active verbs: intrude, challenge, soften the blow. These lay bare the inner- dynamic of the scene: a vigorous dynamic between two opposing views. And so the scene-title – the major action of the scene – contains and supports all the units of action within it.

I would use this method of dissecting the scene at the start of a rehearsal process with actors. It is much more effective than sitting around speculat- ing about what is going on in the scene, what the character’s ‘motivations’ are, etc. It is also equally useful in its application to a play in draft form.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's analyze a scene where Li Mei confronts Liu Taibao, who tries to force her to become his mistress. Li Mei refuses and stands up for herself, resulting in Liu Taibao vowing to take revenge on her.

Scene: Li Mei's Defiance

1. Liu Taibao intrudes: Liu Taibao enters Li Mei's studio uninvited, trying to assert his authority and power over her.

2. Li Mei challenges: Li Mei stands her ground, questioning Liu Taibao's intentions and motives.

3. Liu Taibao threatens: Liu Taibao issues a threat, using his power as a corrupt official to intimidate Li Mei, revealing his plan to force her into becoming his mistress.

4. Li Mei refuses: Despite the danger, Li Mei firmly rejects Liu Taibao's advances, asserting her self-worth and independence.

5. Liu Taibao retaliates: Angered by Li Mei's defiance, Liu Taibao vows to take revenge on her and destroy her career.

6. Li Mei gathers support: Li Mei seeks help from her friends, lover, and mentor to face the challenges posed by Liu Taibao.

In this scene, we can identify the major shifts of action, subject, and mood. The scene-title, "Li Mei's Defiance," encapsulates the scene's primary action and supports all the units of action within it. The scene is characterized by a vigorous dynamic between Li Mei and Liu Taibao, highlighting their opposing views and values.

Using this method of dissecting the scene can be helpful at the start of a rehearsal process with actors, as it provides a clear understanding of the scene's structure, the characters' motivations, and the shifts in action. It is also useful when working on a play in draft form, as it helps identify areas that may need strengthening or clarification.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Part two – sectioning the scene at draft-stage

1	Take a play that is in development (individual or group). Look at a scene or sequence from it, at first draft stage. Apply the above method to the scene or sequence, step by step. See how the process enables us to identify the changes that need to be made. In the exam- ples I will be using a play by Manjinder Virk, with whom I recently worked as dramaturge. (See Examples 117.6 and 117.7.)

2	Take your own opening scene and apply the same method to it. Be as rigorous as you were with the extant play in the first part of the exer- cise. Where are the shifts and what are they? What is the inner- dynamic? Do the section-titles support the scene-title? Where is the flab? Where are the missing support-beams?

3	Repeat the above process for all the scenes of the play.

4	Write out the list of all the scene-titles for the whole play.

5	On the basis of step 3, decide what the main action title of the whole play is and write it out. (See Example 117.8.)

6	On the basis of the whole exercise, where are the gaps? What pas- sages, sections or scenes are redundant? What aspects of exposition are missing? Which characters need to be fleshed out or written out?

assistant: 1. In the context of Li Mei's story, let's take a scene where Li Mei is working on her designs in her studio, and her friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying visit her to offer support and encouragement. Li Mei shares her doubts and fears with her friends, who help her regain her confidence.

Scene: Li Mei's Turning Point

2. Apply the method to this opening scene:

- Li Mei struggles: Li Mei is in her studio, feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of competing against her rival, Huang Shan, and facing Liu Taibao's threats.

- Wu Yue and Chen Ying arrive: Her friends enter the studio to check on her and offer their support.

- Li Mei expresses her doubts: She shares her fears and insecurities about her ability to succeed in the fashion industry and deal with her adversaries.

- Wu Yue shares her perspective: Wu Yue, as an artist, provides a unique viewpoint on how to overcome challenges and stay true to oneself.

- Chen Ying offers encouragement: Chen Ying reminds Li Mei of her strengths and the importance of staying strong for herself and those she cares about.

- Li Mei regains confidence: With her friends' support, Li Mei finds the strength to face her challenges head-on and continue pursuing her dreams.

3. Repeat the process for all the scenes of the play, creating section-titles for each scene.

4. Write out the list of all the scene-titles for the whole play. Some examples include:

- Li Mei's Dream

- The Rivalry Begins

- Professor Liu's Guidance

- The Love Triangle

- Li Mei's Defiance (as previously mentioned)

- Li Mei's Turning Point (as analyzed above)

- The Fashion Showdown

- Triumph Over Adversity

5. On the basis of step 3, the main action title of the whole play is: "Li Mei's Pursuit of Dreams and Overcoming Adversity."

6. Analyze the play based on the exercise:

- Gaps: There may be a need for more scenes showing Li Mei's growth as a designer or deepening the relationships between characters.

- Redundant passages: Some conversations might be repetitive or not contribute to the story's progression.

- Missing exposition: It could be helpful to include more background information on Li Mei's village life, her relationship with her strict father, or her love affair with Zhang Wei.

- Characters to flesh out or write out: Determine if some characters, such as Li Jilai, Professor Liu, or Huang Shan, need more development, or if there are any minor characters that do not contribute to the story and can be removed.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Outcome

We have seen how a sequence, a scene, an act, a whole play can be taken apart in a scientific manner, in order to identify (a) what is happening,

(b)	where the gaps are, and (c) what is redundant. We have also seen how the ‘action titles’ reveal the inner dynamic that leads to the major action of the whole play.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, this exercise aims to dissect the play in a structured manner, helping the writer to understand the key elements of the story and identify any gaps or redundancies. The 'action titles' serve as a blueprint to guide the play's structure and highlight its inner dynamic, ultimately leading to the main action.

For example, let's consider a scene where Li Mei confronts Liu Taibao after he threatens to sabotage her career if she refuses to become his mistress:

Scene: Li Mei's Defiance

(a) What is happening:

- Li Mei confronts Liu Taibao: Li Mei bravely stands up to Liu Taibao, refusing to give in to his threats and demands.

- Liu Taibao threatens her: He tries to intimidate Li Mei by leveraging his power and connections to sabotage her career and reputation.

- Li Mei remains strong: Despite the threats, Li Mei stays firm in her decision and gains the courage to expose Liu Taibao's corruption.

(b) Where the gaps are:

- The scene may need more context about Liu Taibao's previous attempts to manipulate Li Mei or his history of corruption.

- It might be helpful to show the support system around Li Mei, such as her friends, lover, or mentor, who encourage her to stand up to the villain.

- The consequences of Li Mei's defiance could be further explored in later scenes, including the repercussions on her career and personal life.

(c) What is redundant:

- Any dialogue or action that doesn't contribute to the scene's main goal or the characters' development should be eliminated.

- Superfluous descriptions or stage directions that don't enhance the atmosphere or mood of the scene can be cut down.

By analyzing the play in this manner, the writer can identify the most crucial aspects of the story, address gaps, and remove redundancies. Furthermore, the 'action titles' reveal the underlying dynamics that propel the story forward and culminate in the play's main action, such as "Li Mei's Pursuit of Dreams and Overcoming Adversity." This structured approach allows for a more cohesive and compelling narrative, ensuring that the play remains engaging and focused on its central themes.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

CONSTANT CHANGE

We have looked at change happening with the major events, beginning with the First Major Turning Point. However, change is happening constantly, to greater or lesser degrees. We saw how an opening scene can be broken down into sections, each of which shift to a new active drive. We saw how these changes all lead to, and support, the main change in the scene.

In the following exercises we will look at how ‘change’ happens on      a moment-to-moment basis. Again, these are exercises that actors and

directors often use at the start of rehearsals, to get to grips with the dynamics of the story. They are equally useful to the writer, in terms of fine-tuning the script as it develops.

assistant: Constant change refers to the subtle shifts and alterations in a scene or play that occur on a moment-to-moment basis. These changes can be emotional, situational, or driven by a character's actions and reactions. Recognizing and understanding these constant changes can help actors and directors during rehearsals and writers while fine-tuning the script.

Let's consider a scene from Li Mei's story, where she presents her fashion designs to a panel of judges in a competition:

Scene: Li Mei's Big Break

1. Nervous anticipation: Li Mei anxiously waits for her turn, taking deep breaths and trying to calm herself.

2. Courageous decision: Li Mei decides to showcase her most unique and innovative design, even though it may be a risk.

3. Confident presentation: As Li Mei steps forward and presents her designs, her confidence grows, and she speaks passionately about her vision.

4. Judges' questioning: The judges ask challenging questions, causing Li Mei to momentarily doubt herself.

5. Reaffirming her belief: Li Mei remembers her journey and the support from her friends, reaffirming her belief in her work.

6. Judges' positive feedback: The judges praise her designs, leading to a sense of validation and triumph for Li Mei.

In this example, we can see how the scene is composed of a series of smaller changes, each of which propels the story and Li Mei's emotional journey forward. These moment-to-moment shifts allow the scene to be dynamic and engaging, as Li Mei navigates various emotions and challenges.

Understanding these constant changes is essential for actors and directors, as it helps them to bring depth and authenticity to their performances. For writers, being aware of these subtle shifts helps in refining the script, ensuring that the story maintains its momentum and remains captivating for the audience. By focusing on these constant changes, the scene becomes a dynamic and engaging part of the overall narrative.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 118 Attack, retreat, stand ground Part one

All psychological interactions between people can be categorised under any one of three active headings: I attack, I retreat, I stand my ground.

assistant: In this exercise, we will analyze a scene from Li Mei's story, focusing on the psychological interactions between characters using the three categories: attack, retreat, and stand ground.

Scene: Li Mei confronts Liu Taibao

1. Attack: Li Mei learns about Liu Taibao's plan to sabotage her career in retaliation for her refusal to become his mistress. She decides to confront him directly, accusing him of corruption and abuse of power.

2. Retreat: Liu Taibao initially tries to deny any wrongdoing and attempts to deflect Li Mei's accusations by offering her gifts and a promise to help her career.

3. Stand ground: Li Mei refuses to be swayed by Liu Taibao's offers and maintains her position, reiterating her commitment to her own integrity and hard work.

4. Attack: Liu Taibao, angered by Li Mei's resistance, threatens her family and friends, forcing her to reconsider her stance.

5. Retreat: Li Mei, worried about the safety of her loved ones, momentarily considers agreeing to Liu Taibao's demands to protect them.

6. Stand ground: Encouraged by the support of her friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, as well as her lover Zhang Wei, Li Mei decides to expose Liu Taibao's corruption and stand up against his threats.

7. Attack: Li Mei, with the help of her friends and mentor, Professor Liu, gathers evidence against Liu Taibao and brings it to the attention of the authorities.

8. Retreat: Facing public exposure and legal consequences, Liu Taibao backs down, realizing that he has lost his power over Li Mei.

In this scene, the psychological interactions between Li Mei and Liu Taibao are dynamic and constantly shifting. Understanding these interactions through the lens of attack, retreat, and stand ground can help actors, directors, and writers to create a more nuanced and engaging portrayal of the characters' emotional journey and their struggle for power.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Part two – attack, retreat, stand ground

Under the three headings, write lists of actives (single words or well- known expressions) that can be applied to psychological interactions. High-level actions appear at the top of the list, moving down to low-level actions at the bottom.

assistant: In this exercise, we will create lists of actives (actions or expressions) that fall under the categories of attack, retreat, and stand ground. These actives can be applied to the psychological interactions between characters in Li Mei's story. High-level actions will appear at the top of the list, with low-level actions at the bottom.

Attack:

- Confront

- Accuse

- Threaten

- Challenge

- Intimidate

- Manipulate

- Expose

- Criticize

- Insult

- Mock

Retreat:

- Apologize

- Compromise

- Admit fault

- Beg for mercy

- Avoid conflict

- Concede

- Deflect blame

- Submit

- Hide

- Deny

Stand Ground:

- Defend

- Resist

- Assert

- Affirm

- Persist

- Reassure

- Maintain

- Justify

- Support

- Hold firm

For example, in a scene where Li Mei confronts her rival Huang Shan about copying her designs, the psychological interactions between the characters can be analyzed using these actives:

1. Li Mei (Attack): Accuses Huang Shan of stealing her designs.

2. Huang Shan (Stand Ground): Defends herself, insisting that her designs are original.

3. Li Mei (Attack): Challenges Huang Shan to prove her innocence.

4. Huang Shan (Retreat): Admits that she was inspired by Li Mei's work, but didn't intend to copy it.

5. Li Mei (Stand Ground): Asserts the importance of originality in the fashion industry and demands Huang Shan to come up with her own ideas.

These actives can help writers, actors, and directors create more dynamic and engaging interactions between characters, revealing their emotional state and motivations throughout the story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 119 Actioning the text Part one

Take a passage from a play that you have united. Bearing in mind the title of the units of action , decide upon the ‘active’ of each unit of speech (or ‘beat’ as it may be termed).

assistant: In this exercise, we will apply "actioning the text" to a passage from Li Mei's story. We will identify the units of action and decide upon the active for each unit of speech or beat. Here's a scene where Li Mei confronts Liu Taibao, who is trying to force her to be his mistress.

Scene: Li Mei meets Liu Taibao in his office

Unit 1 - Defiance

Li Mei (Stand Ground): "I won't become your mistress, Mr. Liu. I have my own dreams and ambitions."

Unit 2 - Intimidation

Liu Taibao (Attack): "You should reconsider, Li Mei. You wouldn't want anything bad happening to your father's business, would you?"

Unit 3 - Protection

Li Mei (Defend): "My family has nothing to do with this. Leave them out of it!"

Unit 4 - Coercion

Liu Taibao (Threaten): "You're making a big mistake, Li Mei. I have the power to make your life very difficult."

Unit 5 - Resolve

Li Mei (Assert): "I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Liu. I will find a way to succeed without compromising my values."

In this scene, we can see the progression of actions or beats, with Li Mei standing her ground and defending her family, while Liu Taibao uses intimidation and threats to coerce her. Identifying the actives for each unit of speech helps to clarify the dynamics of the scene and the characters' motivations, making it easier for actors, directors, and writers to understand and convey the story effectively.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Part two – actioning the text

Take a passage from your own play that you have sectioned. Bearing in mind the title of the section, decide upon the ‘active’ of each unit of speech (or beat). Does each beat lock into and support the action title of the section? Where is the flab? What is missing?

Outcome

We have now seen that ‘change’ is constantly happening in a play as inexorably as the second-hand ticks away on the clock. There may be passages in a play where ‘idle conversation’ is being depicted, but there is nothing idle in the construction of those passages. Everything is there for a purpose: to move the story along, to prepare for the next major change. Everything in the play is preparing for the final outcome.

assistant: In this exercise, we will analyze a passage from Li Mei's story, focusing on how the action titles of each section contribute to the overall scene. We will identify any unnecessary elements or missing information in the passage.

Scene: Li Mei discussing her plans with Wu Yue and Chen Ying at a café

Unit 1 - Sharing

Li Mei (Reveal): "I want to start my own fashion business, focusing on modern qipao designs."

Unit 2 - Encouragement

Wu Yue (Support): "That's a fantastic idea, Li Mei! You're so talented, and I know you'll be successful."

Unit 3 - Concern

Chen Ying (Question): "But what about your father? How does he feel about this?"

Unit 4 - Determination

Li Mei (Affirm): "He may not fully understand my passion, but I can't let that hold me back."

Unit 5 - Solidarity

Wu Yue (Unite): "We'll be there for you, Li Mei. Together, we'll make your dream come true."

In this scene, the action titles of each section contribute to the development of the story. The conversation moves from Li Mei sharing her plans to Wu Yue's encouragement and Chen Ying's concerns, leading to Li Mei's determination and the solidarity of the three friends. The beats in the passage support the action titles, showing the natural flow of the conversation and the characters' emotions.

There is no apparent flab in this passage, as each beat is relevant to the overall scene. However, it might be beneficial to include a beat where Li Mei mentions her concerns about Liu Taibao, to foreshadow the upcoming conflict and add depth to the scene.

By recognizing the constant change happening in a play, a writer can ensure that each scene and passage contributes to the overall story, preparing the audience for the final outcome.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PLAY

We have seen how a play is ‘about’  a  subject  matter  (the  major  arc  of the story) and ‘about’ a theme (a universal human concern). These are

linked by something that lies at the heart of every story: some major question or proposition about human life and activity. It is never spelled out for the audience, but the writer must be clear what that is, for it is the foun- dation of the play and the reason for writing it. It can be expressed in            a clear, one-sentence statement. The outcome of the story and its theme  will answer or prove/disprove the major questions or propositions.

A major question that the story of Macbeth asks might be: ‘If we reject our better instincts in order to pursue our desire for earthly power, do we forfeit our right to spiritual salvation?’

A major proposition that the story of Little Red Riding Hood presents might be: ‘We can fully develop only if we reject the rules and put our- selves to the test.’

Never spelled out for the audience, but constantly suggesting itself through the story and its themes, this statement prompts questions and expectations in the minds of the audience. This is what hooks us into the story and keeps us there until the final outcome.

The major-question posed by the play Macbeth might be: ‘Will Macbeth manage to redeem himself?’

The major proposition placed by Little Red Riding Hood might be: ‘Will Little Red get through the test she has set herself?’

When you are writing your first draft, concentrating on getting the story out and developing the characters, you should not worry too much about major questions and propositions. There may be writers who start from a question or an abstract proposition, but I wouldn’t advise it. What gets us going as writers is the excitement of the story, the creation of new worlds, the god-like manipulation of characters. Now that you are onto your second draft, it is time to give some thought to what may lie at the root of your play, what it is really ‘about’.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we will identify the major question or proposition that lies at the foundation of the play, connecting the subject matter and theme. This statement should never be explicitly mentioned to the audience but should underlie the story and its themes, prompting questions and expectations in their minds.

Li Mei's story revolves around her pursuit of her dream to become a top fashion designer in the city despite her strict father and the challenges she faces, including her rival Huang Shan and the corrupt official Liu Taibao.

Major Question: 'Can someone overcome the obstacles in their personal and professional life and achieve their dreams while remaining true to their values?'

This question is not explicitly spelled out for the audience, but it is the driving force behind Li Mei's story. As the audience follows her journey, they will naturally wonder if she will be able to overcome the challenges she faces and achieve her dreams without compromising her principles.

Major Proposition: 'Li Mei's determination, resilience, and support from her friends will allow her to confront the obstacles in her path and achieve her dreams.'

This proposition sets the expectation for the audience and suggests the direction the story might take. The audience will be engaged, waiting to see if Li Mei's story will prove this proposition true.

As a writer, focusing on the major question and proposition can help you refine your story during the revision process. By having a clear understanding of what your play is truly 'about,' you can ensure that each scene, character, and plot point contributes to answering the major question or proving/disproving the major proposition. This will ultimately create a more compelling and cohesive narrative.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 120 The essence of the play

Participants: All groups, individual

The major proposition or question is the essence of your play: the big idea or abstract thought you have (probably unconsciously) been deal- ing with. Having followed through all the exercises in this chapter so far, what do you think is the big, major question or proposition your play is addressing. One method of discovering what this might be is as follows.

You will have already done some of this work.

1	Section the scenes and title them: (a) major action, (b) major change,

(b)	major proposition or question.

2	If the play is structured on acts, title these also: (a) major action,

(b) major change, (c) major proposition or question.

3	List all the major propositions or questions posed by the scenes.

4	List all the major propositions or questions posed by the acts. (See Examples 120.1.)

5	What does step 4 suggest, in terms of a general preoccupation with certain thoughts, ideas or questions? Is there a pattern? Do some thoughts arise in different forms? Are there words that resonate with each other? Are there dominant ideas? What images arise? (See Examples 120.2.)

6	On the basis of step 5, write out a few possible propositions or ques- tions for the whole play. Try for a simple two-part sentence, in which the essence of the play is captured. (See Examples 120.3.)

7	Choose one of the above.

8	Test it out on the play. Do all the parts of the play, in some way, cast light on it, resonate with it, or reflect it?

9	When you have landed on the proposition or question that seems to embody the essence of what the play is rooted in, write it down on a card.

10	Stick the card on the top of your desk or writing-machine.

11	Re-write your play with this directly in front of you.

12	Remember: you can always change it if the play goes in new directions.

assistant: Let's perform Exercise 120 for Li Mei's story, considering the context and the characters involved:

1. Section the scenes and title them: major action, major change, major proposition or question.

(Scene 1: Li Mei decides to pursue her dream; Scene 2: Li Mei meets her mentor, Professor Liu; Scene 3: Li Mei faces her rival, Huang Shan; Scene 4: Li Mei resists the advances of the villain, Liu Taibao)

2. If the play is structured on acts, title these also: major action, major change, major proposition or question.

(Act 1: Pursuing the Dream; Act 2: Overcoming Rivalry and Adversity)

3. List all the major propositions or questions posed by the scenes.

(Scene 1: Can Li Mei follow her dream despite her background and strict father?; Scene 2: How will Professor Liu help Li Mei in her journey?; Scene 3: How will Li Mei handle the rivalry with Huang Shan?; Scene 4: Can Li Mei stand up against Liu Taibao and his revenge?)

4. List all the major propositions or questions posed by the acts.

(Act 1: Can Li Mei overcome personal obstacles to pursue her dream?; Act 2: Can Li Mei rise above rivalry and adversity to achieve her goal?)

5. Identify patterns, dominant ideas, or images from steps 3 and 4.

(Patterns: Overcoming obstacles, standing up against adversity, personal growth)

6. Write out a few possible propositions or questions for the whole play.

(Option 1: Can Li Mei overcome obstacles and adversity to achieve her dream of becoming a top fashion designer?; Option 2: Will Li Mei's determination and support from her friends be enough to help her face challenges and achieve her dream?)

7. Choose one of the above.

(Option 1: Can Li Mei overcome obstacles and adversity to achieve her dream of becoming a top fashion designer?)

8. Test it out on the play.

(Yes, this major question is relevant throughout the play and is at the core of Li Mei's journey.)

9. Write down the chosen proposition or question on a card.

10. Stick the card on the top of your desk or writing-machine.

11. Rewrite your play with this directly in front of you.

12. Remember: you can always change it if the play goes in new directions.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the essence of Li Mei's story remains a focal point throughout the writing process, allowing you to create a cohesive and engaging narrative.

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

●	We have seen how, by dissecting a whole scene, the internal dynamic can be exposed. By giving active titles to the sections and the scene, we discovered what the major  action  of  the  scene  is,  and  what  the major change in the scene is. By applying that method to the whole play, we have seen how the full arc of the story is supported by all the other structural elements.

●	We have seen how the major theme or themes of the play are sug- gested from the outset, through deliberate placing and weighting of key words and images.

●	We have seen how the major theme, woven into the main story action, gives rise to the major proposition/question upon which the play is based. As the foundation of the play, it is reflected in and resonates with every moment of the play.

The major proposition/question is the foundation of the play. A beat (unit of speech) is the smallest dramatic moment.

A section (unit of dialogue, or episode) is a sequence of related beats.

A scene is a sequence of sections, introducing and completing a significant event.

An act is a sequence of scenes, dramatically concluding a series of significant events.

An event is a major pressure moment and turning point for the protagonist.

The first major turning point is the event that kick-starts the plot.

The plot is charted by the events.  The story develops around the plot. The themes are woven into the story.

The final outcome concludes the major theme of the story.

The major theme is expressed in the major proposition behind    the story.

The major proposition/question is the foundation of the play.

Before you proceed with your second draft, there are a few more items we should consider.

assistant: Assessing the outcome of the exercises and techniques you've applied to Li Mei's story, you can observe the following results:

1. By dissecting scenes and applying active titles, you've exposed the internal dynamic of the play, identifying major actions and changes in each scene.

2. You've identified the major themes in the play, starting with the deliberate placement and weighting of keywords and images.

3. The major theme, woven into the main story action, leads to the major proposition/question, which serves as the foundation of the play. This major proposition/question is reflected and resonates throughout the entire play.

4. You've explored the hierarchical structure of the play, from beats (smallest dramatic moments) to sections, scenes, and acts, each containing and building upon the smaller units.

5. You've understood the importance of events as major turning points for the protagonist and the plot, with the first major turning point kick-starting the plot.

6. The plot is charted by events, with the story developing around the plot and the themes woven into the story. This leads to the final outcome, which concludes the major theme of the story.

7. You've seen that the major theme is expressed in the major proposition behind the story, and the major proposition/question is the foundation of the play.

With these insights, you are now better prepared to work on your second draft of Li Mei's story. You have a clearer understanding of the play's structure, themes, and the underlying major proposition/question. By focusing on these elements and ensuring they are well-incorporated into your play, you can create a cohesive and engaging narrative that resonates with your audience.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

BECAUSE OR IF

Let us imagine that there are only two types of play. One has a major proposition at its heart that uses the word ‘because’; the other uses the word ‘if’.

Exercise 121 Because

Complete the following sentences (do not include the word ‘if’):

●	People kill because . . .

●	People love because . . .

●	People make art because . . .

●	People go to war because . . .

●	People have prejudices because . . .

●	People work because . . .

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's complete the following sentences using the word 'because':

1. People kill because they feel threatened, desperate, or seek revenge, like Liu Taibao trying to take revenge on Li Mei for refusing his advances.

2. People love because they find comfort, companionship, and happiness in others, as Li Mei and Zhang Wei support and care for each other in their relationship.

3. People make art because it allows them to express their emotions, ideas, and identity, like Wu Yue, the lesbian artist who channels her creativity and experiences into her artwork.

4. People go to war because they seek power, resources, or have conflicting beliefs, though this concept doesn't directly apply to Li Mei's story.

5. People have prejudices because they lack understanding, empathy, or are influenced by cultural biases, as seen with Li Jilai's strict expectations for his daughter Li Mei, which could be due to his upbringing and societal norms.

6. People work because they need to support themselves and their families, pursue their passions, or contribute to society, like Li Mei's dream of becoming a top fashion designer in the city.

user: Exercise 123 People kill because . . .

Complete the sentence five times, starting with your original one.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story:

1. People kill because they feel threatened, desperate, or seek revenge, like Liu Taibao trying to take revenge on Li Mei for refusing his advances.

2. People kill because they wish to eliminate competition or rivals, as Li Mei and Huang Shan compete against each other in the fashion industry.

3. People kill because they are driven by jealousy or envy, which may lead to impulsive, destructive actions.

4. People kill because they have been manipulated or coerced by someone in power, like the corrupted official Liu Taibao who exploits his authority.

5. People kill because they believe it will lead to personal gain, power, or advancement, in situations where one's success is seen as dependent on another's downfall.

user: Exercise 124 If people kill . . .

Complete the sentence five times, starting with your original one.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story:

1. If people kill, they might face severe consequences and disrupt the balance of their relationships, like the potential impact of Liu Taibao's actions on his career and relationships.

2. If people kill, it can lead to a cycle of violence and revenge, causing further suffering for all parties involved, including innocent bystanders.

3. If people kill, they may experience guilt, regret, or psychological trauma as they grapple with the aftermath of their actions.

4. If people kill, it can change the course of their lives and the lives of those around them, potentially altering the trajectory of Li Mei's dream to become a top fashion designer.

5. If people kill, it can expose deep-rooted issues within society, highlighting the corrupt and dangerous influences that shape people's actions, such as the villainous character of Liu Taibao.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Outcome

In the previous exercises we have explored what the choice of writing an ‘if play’ or a ‘because play’ implies.

●	‘Because’ tends to seek a closed answer – and therefore a solution: people will stop killing if their anger is removed. It also accepts as a given that killing is, under present conditions, a factor of human life.

●	‘If’ tends not to seek a root cause. It accepts that killing might go on, but is more concerned with exploring the consequences of the action: how exactly does the act of killing destroy the individual killer?

●	‘Because’ plays tend to offer a solution to a social issue. The plays of Bernard Shaw and Bertolt Brecht seek to expose the mechanisms of  a corrupt or unjust society, and in doing so propose a better system  of living. Agitprop theatre, Forum theatre and some forms of Theatre- in-Education seek to diagnose the root causes of social or political ills, and suggest to the audience ways in which they can be overcome.

●	‘If’ plays tend not to question the underlying structures of society. They tend to look at how individual human beings operate within the scope of their circumstances. In his play Private Lives, Noel Coward is not concerned with questioning the society that has produced  his spoiled, rich protagonists; he is looking at the consequences of infatuation.

●	Perhaps the most interesting plays contain both the ‘because’ and the ‘if’. Chekhov tends towards the ‘if’ – he certainly doesn’t propose that Masha would cease to be unhappy should the wealth of the world be equally divided. But the social levels in the plays – masters and ser- vants, petty bureaucrats and landowners – draw a picture of a society that corrupts people’s relations. In her plays, Caryl Churchill makes it clear that unjust social relations bear down on the lives of the women she depicts. In her play A Raisin in the Sun, Lorraine Hansberry asks what happens when a black man dreams of achieving a better exis- tence, and exposes the roots of a society that seeks to deny him that dream.

●	At all stages of our writing, we can now ask ourselves: how much ‘because’ and how much ‘if’?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, both 'because' and 'if' play significant roles in shaping the narrative and the characters' motivations.

'Because' in Li Mei's story:

1. Li Mei dreams of becoming a top fashion designer because she wants to break free from the constraints of her small village and create a better life for herself.

2. Her father, Li Jilai, is strict because he wants to protect Li Mei and ensure she adheres to the traditional values he believes in.

3. Liu Taibao seeks revenge on Li Mei because she refuses to become his mistress, which offends his ego and desire for power.

'If' in Li Mei's story:

1. If Li Mei succeeds in becoming a top fashion designer, she will not only achieve her dreams but also challenge societal expectations and inspire others to pursue their own ambitions.

2. If Liu Taibao's revenge plot against Li Mei is successful, it could derail her dreams, affect her relationships, and potentially expose the corruption within society.

3. If Li Mei and her friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, continue to support each other, they will grow stronger and more resilient in the face of adversity.

Li Mei's story intertwines 'because' and 'if' elements, presenting a complex narrative that explores the motivations behind characters' actions and the consequences of those actions. By addressing both 'because' and 'if', the story delves into the underlying social structures that influence the characters' lives while also examining how their individual choices and actions shape their destinies.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

SUBPLOT

Secondary sequences of actions are often termed the subplot. The characters involved are of  lesser  importance,  but  their  function  is  no  less vital for that. The subplot may be closely linked to the main story, running parallel to it or as a contrast to it. In Elizabethan and Jacobean drama the subplots mirrored the main plot, often  as  low  comedy  and  with characters of lower social  status.  In  Shakespeare’s  As  You  Like  It,  the developing love story of the aristocratic Rosalind and Orlando is paralleled by the courtships, wooings and fallings out of shepherdesses and foresters. The function of the subplots there is to cast different lights on   the main themes of the play. In Macbeth, the subplot of the loving and honourable  Macduff  family  serves  to  contrast   with   the   hate-filled   and treacherous Macbeths. In both cases, they illuminate the main themes of the play.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, a subplot could involve the relationships and personal struggles of her best friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying. This subplot would serve to cast different lights on the main themes of the play and provide contrast or depth to Li Mei's own journey.

For example, Wu Yue, an openly lesbian artist, could face challenges in her pursuit of love and acceptance within a society that may not be as understanding or supportive. Her journey to embrace her identity and find love could mirror Li Mei's own journey to break free from traditional expectations and achieve her dreams.

On the other hand, Chen Ying, a beautiful housewife, could struggle with her own self-worth and identity, as she navigates societal expectations of a woman in her position. Her journey to self-discovery and empowerment could run parallel to Li Mei's journey, highlighting the importance of friendship and support in overcoming personal and societal obstacles.

These subplots, involving Wu Yue and Chen Ying, would serve to enhance the main plot of Li Mei's story, providing additional layers of complexity and depth. By exploring their personal struggles, relationships, and growth, the subplots would illuminate the main themes of the play, such as the pursuit of personal dreams, the importance of friendship, and the challenges of overcoming societal expectations.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 125 Secondary characters

Ask yourself the following questions:

1	Does your play contain secondary characters and sequences of actions?

2	What is the dramatic function of the secondary characters?

3	Do the journeys of the secondary characters lock into the main plot and the themes of the play?

4	If your play does not contain subplot, would it benefit from doing so?

assistant: 1. Yes, Li Mei's story contains secondary characters and sequences of actions. Secondary characters include her best friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying, her lover Zhang Wei, her mentor Professor Liu, her rival Huang Shan, and the villain Liu Taibao.

2. The dramatic function of the secondary characters is to provide support, conflict, and contrast to Li Mei's journey. For example, Wu Yue and Chen Ying provide friendship and emotional support, while Huang Shan and Liu Taibao create obstacles and challenges that Li Mei must overcome. Professor Liu serves as a mentor, guiding Li Mei on her path, and Zhang Wei's love for Li Mei adds another layer of emotional complexity to the story.

3. The journeys of the secondary characters lock into the main plot and the themes of the play. Wu Yue and Chen Ying's personal struggles and growth can parallel and contrast with Li Mei's own journey, highlighting themes such as pursuing personal dreams and overcoming societal expectations. Zhang Wei's love for Li Mei adds depth to the story, illustrating the power of love and its role in Li Mei's life. The conflicts with Huang Shan and Liu Taibao emphasize the challenges faced by Li Mei, adding tension and stakes to her pursuit of becoming a top fashion designer.

4. The play already contains subplots involving the secondary characters, which enhance the main plot and themes. Adding more subplots may risk overcomplicating the story, so it's important to balance the focus on Li Mei's journey with the secondary characters' contributions. The current structure with its subplots provides a well-rounded narrative that effectively explores the themes and deepens the main plot.

CHARACTER: OBJECTIVES

Earlier in this chapter, we looked at how the characters are always ‘doing’ (the actives behind the dialogue). From moment to moment, section to section, scene to scene, etc., they have goals and objectives they wish to achieve (consciously or unconsciously).This applies to all the characters, but most particularly to the protagonist(s).

assistant: Character objectives are the driving force behind a character's actions and motivations in a story. These objectives can be internal (emotional or psychological) or external (physical or situational), and they change as the story progresses. Understanding character objectives helps to create realistic, dynamic, and engaging characters that resonate with audiences.

For example, let's consider Li Mei's story. As the protagonist, Li Mei has multiple objectives throughout the play:

1. Emotional objective: Li Mei wants to gain her father's approval and prove her worth as a fashion designer. This internal objective motivates her to work hard and strive for success in her career.

2. Professional objective: Li Mei's dream is to become the top fashion designer in Hangzhou. This external objective drives her to create unique designs, learn new skills, and compete against her rival, Huang Shan.

3. Relationship objective: Li Mei wants to maintain her love for Zhang Wei while balancing her ambitions and dealing with societal expectations. This emotional objective adds complexity to her character and her relationships with others.

Throughout the play, Li Mei's objectives may shift or evolve as she faces new challenges, meets new people, and learns more about herself. For instance, when she encounters the corrupt official Liu Taibao, her objective might shift to resisting his advances and protecting her integrity.

Secondary characters also have their objectives that tie into the main plot or subplots. For example, Wu Yue might have an objective to gain recognition for her art, while Chen Ying may want to find fulfillment outside of her role as a housewife.

By understanding and exploring the objectives of each character, a playwright can create richer, more dynamic stories that resonate with the audience. These objectives help to shape the characters' actions, decisions, and dialogues, making them feel more authentic and relatable. Moreover, having clear objectives for each character helps to create a coherent and engaging narrative structure, ensuring that the story progresses smoothly and keeps the audience invested in the characters' journeys.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 126 The protagonist’s objectives

Ask yourself the following questions about your protagonist:

1	What is her objective in the play?

2	What is her objective in the scene?

3	What is her objective in the sequence?

4	What is her objective in the moment?

5	What is her objective in life?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's consider her objectives at different levels of the narrative:

1. What is her objective in the play?

Li Mei's primary objective in the play is to become the top fashion designer in Hangzhou while navigating various challenges and relationships.

2. What is her objective in the scene?

Assuming a scene where Li Mei is presenting her latest designs in a fashion show, her objective would be to impress the audience, gain recognition for her work, and outshine her rival, Huang Shan.

3. What is her objective in the sequence?

In a sequence where Li Mei is dealing with Liu Taibao's advances, her objective could be to stand up to his harassment and protect her dignity, while simultaneously avoiding any negative repercussions from his attempts at revenge.

4. What is her objective in the moment?

In a specific moment where Li Mei is having a conversation with her father, Li Jilai, her objective could be to gain his approval and support for her dreams, despite his strict nature and possible disapproval of her career choice.

5. What is her objective in life?

Li Mei's life objective is to achieve success and fulfillment in her career as a fashion designer, gain the respect and support of her loved ones, and maintain a balance between her personal and professional life.

By examining Li Mei's objectives at various levels, we can better understand her motivations, desires, and actions throughout the play. This helps to create a more in-depth and engaging portrayal of her character, ensuring that the audience remains invested in her story.

SCENE-SHAPES

We have looked at ‘change’ and how that is happening all the time in a narrative. Major changes occur within scenes: the fortunes of the protag- onists have changed by the end of the scene. They may be large or small changes, emotional or material changes, etc., depending on the story you are writing and the needs of the narrative; but the characters leave the scene changed in some way.

I have already mentioned how actors can speak of dealing with an audi- ence in terms of doing battle. It is useful to use the battleground image when thinking of a scene in a play: someone will be the victor, someone will be defeated (or they may be stalemate after a struggle). The following exercises will use the shapes of the square and the triangle as the literal sites of struggle.

For the purposes of the exercises, I would like us to think of a scene as a sequence of actions that take place within a continuous time frame.

●	Think of a scene as having the shape of a square. Think of it as an emotional battlefield, or football pitch.

●	The scene contains two characters, A and B. We know nothing about them at the start. We come to the scene allowing them equal status (space on the pitch).

●	By the end of the scene, character B has ‘invaded’ the pitch to the extent that character A is pushed into a corner.

●	By the end of the next scene, character A has regained a lot of ground.

●	By the end of the next scene, character B has been joined by character

C. They have nearly driven character A off the pitch.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's consider a sequence of three scenes using the concept of scene-shapes, specifically the square, as an emotional battlefield.

Scene 1:

Li Mei (character A) and her strict father, Li Jilai (character B), engage in a heated argument about her pursuit of a career in fashion design. As the scene progresses, Li Jilai raises concerns about the instability of the fashion industry, and how it may not provide a secure future for Li Mei. By the end of the scene, Li Mei finds herself cornered, with her father's concerns shaking her confidence and leaving her questioning her dreams.

Scene 2:

Li Mei, still struggling with the doubts instilled by her father, turns to her best friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, for support. Through their encouragement and belief in her talent, Li Mei slowly regains her confidence and determination, pushing back against her father's fears and reclaiming her space on the emotional battlefield.

Scene 3:

In this scene, Li Mei's rival, Huang Shan (character C), joins forces with her father, Li Jilai (character B), to further criticize and undermine Li Mei's aspirations. With their combined efforts, they nearly drive Li Mei off the emotional battlefield, making her feel even more isolated and unsure of her path.

These three scenes demonstrate the use of the square as an emotional battleground, where characters A, B, and C (Li Mei, Li Jilai, and Huang Shan) struggle for dominance and influence. The shifting power dynamics and emotional states of the characters create engaging conflicts and drive the story forward.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 127 Pushing the boundaries

1	You have three characters: A, B and C.

2	Place A and B in a situation. Keep it simple. Scene one is the square.

3	Write notes on the first three scenes of a play. They will begin and end according to the progression of shapes suggested below.

4	Bear in mind that, even though the final scene ends with B and C ‘cornering’ A, this does not mean they will (as the play progresses) finally win the battle.

Start of scene one: A and B are sharing a social moment. They seem to have equal share of the pitch.

End of scene one: B has pushed A onto the defensive.

Start of scene two: A is still on the defensive. Something occurs that gives an opening.

End of scene two: A has regained much ground and B is on the defensive.

Start of scene three: A is now confident that he has nearly gained con- trol of the whole pitch. C now enters the pitch and teams up with B. Together they push A into a very tight corner.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's outline the first three scenes of a play using the concept of pushing the boundaries and the progression of shapes:

Scene 1: A Square

- Start: Li Mei (A) and her father, Li Jilai (B), are enjoying dinner together and discussing Li Mei's experiences in the city. They seem to have equal share of the conversation and are enjoying a social moment.

- End: Li Jilai starts expressing his concerns about Li Mei's dream of becoming a top fashion designer, emphasizing the difficulties and competition she'll face. By the end of the scene, Li Mei feels defensive, as her father's words make her doubt her abilities and aspirations.

Scene 2: A Triangle

- Start: Li Mei, still feeling defensive and unsure of her choices, meets with her mentor, Professor Liu. At first, she is hesitant to open up about her concerns.

- End: Professor Liu notices Li Mei's unease and reassures her, sharing stories of successful designers who faced similar challenges. Li Mei feels reinvigorated and more confident in her pursuit, regaining much ground and pushing her father's concerns to the defensive.

Scene 3: A Tight Corner

- Start: Li Mei, now confident in her dreams, encounters her rival, Huang Shan (C), at a local fashion event. Huang Shan teams up with Li Jilai (B), who happens to be at the same event, and both criticize Li Mei's work.

- End: With the combined force of Huang Shan's mockery and her father's continuing skepticism, Li Mei feels cornered and disheartened, questioning her ability to succeed in the fashion industry.

These three scenes illustrate the concept of pushing the boundaries, with the characters' emotional states and the power dynamics between them changing from scene to scene. As the play progresses, it remains to be seen whether Li Mei will be able to overcome the challenges posed by her father and rival, and achieve her dream of becoming a top fashion designer.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 128 Manipulating the triangle

This is another method of exploring scene-shape and the dynamics that take place within a scene, leading to change by the end of the scene.

1	You are going to write a short (three-step) outline for a narrative that features three characters.

2	At step one, we know nothing about the characters. As far as we know, they have equal status.

3	In the course of the scene there will be shifts in alliances, status, etc. Remember all the work on ‘actioning’ and find strong actions to title the sequences.

4	To depict the shifting nature of what is going on between the characters, we will use the image of a triangle.

5	A close alliance between characters is represented by the closeness of the points of the triangle. Draw the changing shape of the triangle as alliances shift.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's create a short three-step outline for a narrative featuring three characters, exploring scene-shape and dynamics, and using the image of a triangle to represent the shifting alliances.

Step 1: Equal status

- Characters: Li Mei (A), Wu Yue (B), and Chen Ying (C)

- Situation: The three friends meet at a café to catch up and discuss their lives. They begin with equal status and no clear alliances.

- Triangle: Equilateral triangle, with equal distance between A, B, and C.

Step 2: Shifting alliances

- Situation: During their conversation, Wu Yue (B) and Chen Ying (C) express their worries about Li Mei's (A) involvement with Zhang Wei, concerned that he might be distracting her from her dreams.

- Alliance Shift: Li Mei (A) feels betrayed by her friends, while Wu Yue (B) and Chen Ying (C) form a closer alliance.

- Triangle: Isosceles triangle, with B and C closer together, and A at a greater distance from both.

Step 3: Alliance reversal

- Situation: As the conversation continues, Wu Yue (B) shares her own struggles with her art and reveals that she has been receiving support from Zhang Wei, who has been encouraging and helpful.

- Alliance Shift: Li Mei (A) and Wu Yue (B) form a closer alliance, acknowledging the positive impact Zhang Wei has had on their lives, while Chen Ying (C) starts to feel left out.

- Triangle: Another isosceles triangle, with A and B closer together, and C at a greater distance from both.

This exercise illustrates the shifting dynamics and alliances between the characters using the triangle's changing shape. The evolving relationships and power dynamics contribute to the overall narrative and character development in Li Mei's story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 129 The bridge over troubled waters

We have explored scene-shapes as square battlefields and manipulated triangles. We have seen how we can leave a scene with a change of val- ues (material, emotional, situational, spiritual, etc.). It can also be useful   to think of the structure of a scene as a bridge that takes us from opening moment A (dry land) to closing moment Z (dry land). The steps the char- acters take across the bridge represent what the characters do. The water under the bridge represents their unconscious.

1	Take the last example given above (the Tanya, Stuart and Barb story). The middle sequence of the scene is titled ‘Stuart and Barb doubt Tanya’s commitment to the project’.

2	Make the middle sequence more complex by adding two more actives. (See Example 129.1.)

3	The characters are at the middle of the bridge, where the water is deepest. We know from the ‘actions’ what the characters are doing. Think about what is going on under the surface.

4	Write the middle sequence. We know that the scene starts with them in harmony, and that it ends in disharmony. Explore fully this middle sequence. How do the characters move forward, so that they can reach the other side of the bridge?

assistant: 1. Li Mei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying are discussing Li Mei's fashion design project.

2. Middle sequence:

- Li Mei shares her progress and plans for her fashion project

- Wu Yue and Chen Ying express their concerns about Li Mei's relationship with Zhang Wei, doubting her commitment to the project

- Li Mei defends her commitment and explains how Zhang Wei has been supportive

3. Under the surface:

- Wu Yue and Chen Ying might be feeling a bit envious of Li Mei's success and her relationship with Zhang Wei

- Li Mei is insecure about her ability to balance her love life and her career, making her defensive when her commitment is questioned

4. Write the middle sequence:

Li Mei (enthusiastically): "So, I've been working on my new qipao designs and I'm really excited about how they're turning out."

Wu Yue (skeptically): "That's great, Li Mei, but are you sure you can handle this project while being with Zhang Wei? He seems to take up a lot of your time."

Chen Ying (nodding in agreement): "We just worry that he might be a distraction for you."

Li Mei (defensive): "My relationship with Zhang Wei doesn't affect my commitment to my career. In fact, he's been really supportive and encourages me to follow my dreams."

At this point, the characters are in the middle of the bridge, where the water is deepest. As they move forward in the conversation, they will need to address the underlying issues and emotions to reach the other side of the bridge, eventually restoring harmony or leading to further disharmony in their friendship.

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

By visualising scenes as squares, triangles and bridges we have explored further how they have formal underlying structures. The struc- ture of the scenes will finally support the structure of the whole play. As we will now see, the shape of the whole story can be visualised just as formally.

assistant: The outcome of visualizing scenes as squares, triangles, and bridges provides a clearer understanding of the relationships and dynamics between characters and how they evolve throughout the story. These visual representations enable writers to focus on the emotional and situational changes occurring within each scene and to ensure that scenes contribute to the overall narrative.

By exploring scene-shapes, writers can create scenes with compelling conflict and emotional depth, leading to a more engaging and powerful story. As these scene structures contribute to the overall structure of the play, they help maintain a consistent pace, keeping the audience invested in the characters and their journey.

In the context of Li Mei's story, using these visualization techniques ensures that each scene contributes to the development of the characters and their relationships, as well as the progression of the main plot and subplots. This approach also helps to create a balance between the different elements of the story, such as the protagonist's objectives, the antagonist's actions, and the various emotional and situational changes experienced by the characters.

In summary, visualizing scenes as squares, triangles, and bridges provides a valuable method for writers to better understand and develop the structure and dynamics of their story, ultimately leading to a more compelling and engaging narrative.

STORY-SHAPES

In Chapter 1, we saw how a story could be circular, ending where it begins: Exercise 27. We now look at the range of other formal structures that are available for you to use.

1	The linear story. Continuous chronology. At its most classical it observes the dramatic unities of time, place and action.

2	The ‘Chinese box’ story. One large story containing stories within stories.

3	A sequence of separate stories. Not linked by characters or dramatic narrative. Possibly related to each other by theme, location, etc.

4	One long story interrupted by other stories.

5	The relay race story. A sequence of stories connected by characters.

6	Parallel stories. Two or more stories, unconnected in narrative. Possibly differing in time, place, etc. Possibly related to each other by theme, etc.

7	The flashback story. One long story, with the time-sequence  thrown.

8	The circular story, ending up where it started.

assistant: 1. The linear story: This type of story follows a continuous chronology and often adheres to the dramatic unities of time, place, and action. The plot moves in a straight line from the beginning to the end without any interruptions or deviations. An example is "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare, where the story progresses chronologically, depicting the tragic love story of the main characters.

2. The 'Chinese box' story: This structure involves a larger story containing smaller stories within it. Each nested story may contribute to the understanding of the main story or reveal different aspects of the characters or themes. An example is "One Thousand and One Nights," where Scheherazade tells multiple tales to her husband to postpone her execution.

3. A sequence of separate stories: This structure comprises unrelated stories that may share a common theme, location, or other elements. An example is "Dubliners" by James Joyce, a collection of short stories set in Dublin, Ireland, that explores various aspects of human experience.

4. One long story interrupted by other stories: In this structure, a central narrative is interrupted by separate, smaller stories that may provide additional insight or depth to the main story. An example is "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Bronte, where the main narrative is interrupted by stories of different characters, providing context and background.

5. The relay race story: This structure consists of a sequence of stories connected by characters. As one story ends, another begins with a character from the previous story. An example is "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell, where each story is connected to the next by a character or an object, creating a chain of narratives.

6. Parallel stories: In this structure, two or more unrelated narratives run simultaneously, possibly differing in time, place, or other factors. They may be connected by themes, motifs, or other elements. An example is "The Hours" by Michael Cunningham, where three parallel stories, set in different times and places, are connected by the novel "Mrs. Dalloway" and its themes.

7. The flashback story: This structure features a story with non-linear timelines, using flashbacks to reveal information about characters or events. An example is "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, where the narrator, Nick Carraway, recounts the events of the past, providing insights into the characters and their motivations.

8. The circular story: This type of story begins and ends at the same point, creating a cyclical narrative. The characters or events may undergo changes, but the story ultimately returns to its starting point. An example is "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger, where the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, recounts his experiences in a circular narrative, ending up where he started at the beginning of the novel.

user: retell the story of Li mei in type 1, type 4, type 7 and type 8 separately please.

assistant: Type 1 - Linear Story:

Li Mei, a young girl from a small village near Hangzhou, dreams of becoming the top fashion designer in the city. She moves to Hangzhou, where she befriends Wu Yue, a lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful housewife. Li Mei falls in love with Zhang Wei and finds a mentor in Professor Liu. As she pursues her dream, Li Mei faces competition from Huang Shan, who operates a traditional qipao store. A corrupt official, Liu Taibao, tries to force Li Mei to become his mistress, but she refuses, prompting him to seek revenge. Despite these challenges, Li Mei perseveres and eventually achieves her dream, becoming a successful fashion designer.

Type 4 - One Long Story Interrupted by Other Stories:

Li Mei's journey to become a top fashion designer in Hangzhou is the central narrative. Throughout the story, there are interruptions that delve into the lives and experiences of her friends, family, and adversaries, such as Wu Yue's struggle for acceptance as a lesbian artist, Chen Ying's search for meaning in her life as a housewife, and Huang Shan's motivations for competing against Li Mei. These smaller stories provide depth and context to Li Mei's journey.

Type 7 - Flashback Story:

The story begins with Li Mei as a successful fashion designer in Hangzhou, reflecting on her journey to achieve her dream. Through a series of flashbacks, the audience learns about Li Mei's humble beginnings in a small village, her friendships with Wu Yue and Chen Ying, her love story with Zhang Wei, and the obstacles she faced, including the rivalry with Huang Shan and the corruption of Liu Taibao. These flashbacks reveal how Li Mei overcame her struggles and achieved her dream.

Type 8 - Circular Story:

Li Mei's story begins in her small village, where she dreams of becoming a top fashion designer in Hangzhou. The story follows her journey, including her friendships, love, and challenges, ultimately culminating in her success as a designer. In the end, Li Mei returns to her village to share her experiences and inspire others to follow their dreams, bringing the story full circle to where it began.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

assistant: I'll explain each story type using Li Mei's story as an example:

Type 1 - Linear Story:

In a linear story, events unfold chronologically, following a continuous timeline. Li Mei's story, in this format, moves from her life in the village to her journey in Hangzhou without any interruptions or flashbacks. We witness her growth, friendships, love, and challenges as they happen, allowing us to see her progress towards achieving her dream in a straightforward manner.

Example: Li Mei leaves her village, moves to Hangzhou, makes friends, faces challenges, and ultimately becomes a successful fashion designer – all in chronological order.

Type 4 - One Long Story Interrupted by Other Stories:

In this format, Li Mei's central narrative of pursuing her dream is occasionally interrupted by smaller stories or subplots involving other characters. These interruptions provide depth and context to the main story, enriching our understanding of Li Mei's world and relationships.

Example: While Li Mei is working on her designs, the story shifts to Wu Yue's art exhibition, where she faces discrimination for her sexual orientation. This subplot sheds light on the challenges faced by Li Mei's friend, adding complexity to the overall story.

Type 7 - Flashback Story:

A flashback story begins at a certain point in the narrative and then revisits past events through flashbacks, providing background and context. In Li Mei's story, we start with her as a successful designer, and through flashbacks, we learn about her life in the village, her journey to Hangzhou, and the challenges she faced along the way.

Example: The story begins with Li Mei receiving a prestigious fashion award. As she gives her acceptance speech, she recalls her past experiences – from her humble beginnings to the obstacles she overcame – that led her to this moment of success.

Type 8 - Circular Story:

In a circular story, the narrative begins and ends at the same point, often showing the protagonist's growth or change. Li Mei's story starts in her village, where she dreams of becoming a top fashion designer. After achieving her dream, she returns to her village, bringing the story full circle and demonstrating the impact of her experiences.

Example: Li Mei starts her journey in her small village, dreaming of success in the fashion industry. After achieving her dream and becoming a renowned designer, she returns to her village to inspire others and share her story, highlighting the cyclical nature of her journey.

GENRE

Genre.

Dictionary definition: kind, category, or sort, especially of literary or artistic work.

Generic.

Dictionary definition: applicable or referring to a whole class or group.

Polonius: The actors are come hither, my lord.

Hamlet:	Buzz, buzz.

Polonius: Upon mine honour –

Hamlet: Then come each actor on his ass –

Polonius: The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, trag- ical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene indivisible, or poem unlimited.

(Hamlet. Act 2, Scene 2)

It is interesting that Polonius, once he has listed the two major (Western) dramatic categories – tragedy and comedy – then goes on to complexify them. It is as if Shakespeare is acknowledging that the notion of a ‘genre’ is not quite as fixed as it might seem to be in the dictionary sense. The tragic can be the comical. The tragical-comical can be the pastoral.

So how do we define the genre of play we are writing? Do we need to know what category of play we are writing? I would suggest that it is a use- ful exercise, in that it might help us locate the territories we are working in. By territories I mean dramatic style and form.

A composer will know which form (classical or modern) they are work- ing in: sonata, symphony, rap, reggae, blues, etc. Even if they are creating something that is none of these, something that seems entirely new, they will be in some way drawing on or responding to these or other traditional forms. We have seen how Waiting for Godot exhibits the remnants of clas- sical structure; and how Attempts on her Life exhibits the remnants of Waiting for Godot. As playwrights, we are working within a tradition that goes back to the plays of Classical Greece, which in their turn take us back  to the epic tales that came out of the Mediterranean basin, the Middle   East, India and beyond. The play you are writing may not seem to fit into  any particular category,  but it will be drawing on one or another, or a few  of them. What are they? Polonius begins with ‘tragedy’ and ‘comedy’, so   let us start there.

assistant: In the context of playwriting, genres help define the style, form, and theme of the work. Knowing the genre can help playwrights establish the tone and structure they want to use, and it can also provide a framework for the audience to understand the play's intentions. Let's discuss the two primary genres mentioned by Polonius in Hamlet: tragedy and comedy.

Tragedy:

Tragedy is a genre that deals with serious, often somber themes and typically focuses on the suffering and downfall of the main character(s). The purpose of a tragedy is to evoke strong emotions, such as pity and fear, in the audience. These emotions can lead to catharsis – a release or purging of emotions – for the audience. Tragedies often explore themes such as human suffering, fate, and the consequences of hubris or pride.

Example: Shakespeare's "Macbeth" is a classic tragedy. It tells the story of Macbeth, a Scottish nobleman, who becomes consumed by ambition and greed, leading to his eventual downfall. The play explores themes like ambition, guilt, and the destructive nature of power.

Comedy:

Comedy is a genre that aims to entertain and amuse the audience through humor. Comedies often revolve around misunderstandings, mistaken identities, or other comedic situations. The primary goal of a comedy is to make the audience laugh, and the play usually concludes with a happy or satisfying resolution. Comedies can explore various themes, such as love, relationships, and the absurdities of everyday life.

Example: Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest" is a classic comedy. The play uses wit, wordplay, and satire to poke fun at the conventions of Victorian society. The plot revolves around mistaken identities, secret engagements, and the importance of trivial matters in high society.

While tragedy and comedy are the most well-known genres, many plays combine elements from multiple genres or subvert traditional conventions. Knowing the genre(s) your play draws from can help you understand the traditions, themes, and expectations associated with each genre. This understanding can be used as a starting point for crafting your own unique work, as it provides a foundation from which you can build or deviate.

user: Suppose Li Mei's story is a tragedy, please explain it using the tragedy theory

There are (in the Western cultural tradition, which is the one I am posi- tioned in) two great views of human life, which have come down to us from the Greek and Roman playwrights:

●	The tragic: an unhappy ending to lives in  struggle.  Life  is  meaning- less, full of unrelieved pain, with no redemption and doomed to failure and despair. Or, the story of the loss of human values.

●	The comic: a happy ending to lives in struggle. Life as meaningful, compensatory, redemptive and full of hope. Or, the story of the gain of human values.

Where is your play positioned in relationship to the two views? Most likely it will seem to float somewhere between the two. This is fine, since the

words ‘tragic’ and ‘comic’ are rather debased in the world we live in. How do we write a tragedy when any news story uses the word to encapsulate any sorry event? An Iraqi child maimed by a bomb (terrible, but not tragic), the closing down of a pet sanctuary (sad, but not tragic). How do we write comedy when every TV programme encourages us to giggle at anything and think about nothing? A wife meets her husband’s mistress on a reality-show and slaps her face (hilarious but not comic), a stand-up comedian spews out gags about TV shows and ‘relationships’ (worth a snigger, but not comic).

If the categories of ‘pure’ comedy and tragedy have become diluted into a range of sub-genres, it is helpful to identify what those might be.

Tragedy: types of narrative forms in which the outcome tends to be the down- fall of the protagonist, or a negative view of the human condition.

●	Domestic tragedy.

●	Melodrama.

●	Murder mystery.

●	Thriller.

●	High opera.

●	Psychological drama.

●	Social drama.

●	Ghost story.

●	Family saga.

assistant: Suppose Li Mei's story is a tragedy, we can analyze it using the tragedy theory by positioning it within the spectrum of tragic sub-genres and examining the elements that contribute to its tragic outcome.

Li Mei's story can be considered a combination of domestic tragedy, psychological drama, and social drama. These sub-genres explore the conflicts, emotions, and societal pressures that ultimately contribute to Li Mei's downfall.

Domestic Tragedy:

In Li Mei's story, the domestic aspect is rooted in her relationship with her strict father, Li Jilai, and her struggle to become a top fashion designer in the city against her father's wishes. The family conflict intensifies the emotional stakes and adds depth to the tragic elements of the story.

Psychological Drama:

Li Mei's journey is filled with emotional turmoil as she faces her rival, Huang Shan, who operates a traditional qipao store. Her mentor, Professor Liu, and her lover, Zhang Wei, provide support, but she must ultimately rely on her own strength and resilience. The story delves into Li Mei's internal struggles, making it a psychological drama.

Social Drama:

The societal pressures and challenges faced by Li Mei are evident throughout her story. She must navigate a world where a corrupted official, Liu Taibao, tries to force her into becoming his mistress. Her refusal to submit to his demands results in his quest for revenge, further highlighting the social issues at play.

The tragic outcome of Li Mei's story is brought about by a combination of factors, including her strained family relationships, emotional and psychological struggles, and the pressures of societal expectations. Despite her dreams and aspirations, Li Mei faces insurmountable obstacles that ultimately lead to her downfall, creating a tragic narrative that emphasizes the loss of human values and the harsh realities of life.

user: suppose Li Mei's story is a comedy, please explain it in the comedy theory.

Comedy: types of narrative forms in which the outcome tends to be the redemp- tion of the protagonist, or a positive view of the human condition.

●	Domestic comedy.

●	Comedy of manners.

●	Romantic comedy.

●	Light comedy.

●	Satire.

●	Situation comedy.

●	Farce.

●	Pantomime.

●	Operetta.

●	Music hall.

●	Musical comedy.

●	Sketch.

assistant: Suppose Li Mei's story is a comedy, we can analyze it using the comedy theory by positioning it within the spectrum of comedic sub-genres and examining the elements that contribute to its uplifting and positive outcome.

Li Mei's story can be considered a combination of domestic comedy, romantic comedy, and situation comedy. These sub-genres explore the humorous and light-hearted aspects of her journey, leading to a positive view of the human condition.

Domestic Comedy:

In this comedic version, Li Mei's strict father, Li Jilai, is portrayed in a more endearing and amusing light, with humorous misunderstandings and miscommunications between them. As Li Mei pursues her dream of becoming a top fashion designer, the family dynamics provide opportunities for comic relief and funny situations.

Romantic Comedy:

Li Mei's relationship with her lover, Zhang Wei, adds a romantic comedy element to the story. They navigate the ups and downs of their relationship, encountering amusing obstacles and misunderstandings along the way. The love story brings warmth and humor, and ultimately contributes to a happy ending for the couple.

Situation Comedy:

As Li Mei encounters various challenges, such as her rivalry with Huang Shan or dealing with the corrupted official, Liu Taibao, the story can incorporate comedic twists that diffuse the tension and create laughter. Li Mei's interactions with her best friends, Wu Yue and Chen Ying, provide additional opportunities for humor as they support her through these situations.

In the comedic version of Li Mei's story, the narrative emphasizes the lighter aspects of her journey, allowing her to overcome obstacles with wit, humor, and the support of her loved ones. The positive outcome showcases the redemption of the protagonist and reaffirms the resilience and strength of the human spirit, ultimately creating a heartwarming and entertaining comedy.

user: Drama today tends away from the two ‘pure’ categories. For  our  own  work, it is useful to see how any new story can borrow from either of them,

and from their sub-categories. Before asking yourself what genre/genres your own play is drawing on, it is worth taking another narrative and reworking it in various forms.

retell Li mei's story in mixed genre

assistant: In this mixed-genre version of Li Mei's story, elements of domestic comedy, romantic comedy, thriller, and social drama are combined to create a unique and engaging narrative.

Li Mei, a young girl from a small village near Hangzhou, dreams of becoming a top fashion designer in the city. Her journey is filled with moments of humor, romance, suspense, and social commentary.

Domestic Comedy:

Li Mei's relationship with her strict father, Li Jilai, provides a source of humor throughout the story. Their interactions are characterized by misunderstandings and miscommunications, leading to amusing situations that entertain the audience and lighten the overall tone of the story.

Romantic Comedy:

Li Mei's love affair with Zhang Wei adds a romantic comedy element to the narrative. As the couple navigates their relationship, they encounter various obstacles, misunderstandings, and comical situations. Their love story brings warmth and humor to the story while contributing to the overall theme of hope and resilience.

Thriller:

As Li Mei becomes more successful in the fashion world, she catches the attention of a corrupt official, Liu Taibao. He tries to force Li Mei into becoming his mistress, but she resists. This aspect of the story introduces suspense and tension, as Li Mei and her friends must outwit and evade Liu Taibao's malicious plans, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.

Social Drama:

Li Mei's rivalry with Huang Shan, who operates a traditional qipao store, highlights the challenges faced by women in the competitive world of fashion. The story also touches on themes of gender, sexuality, and power dynamics through Li Mei's friendship with Wu Yue, a lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful housewife. These social issues add depth and complexity to the narrative, making it more thought-provoking and relevant.

By blending different genres, Li Mei's story becomes a rich and captivating narrative that explores a wide range of emotions and themes. The combination of comedy, romance, suspense, and social commentary creates a unique and engaging experience for the audience, showcasing the diverse possibilities in storytelling.

Exercise 130 Re-telling the tale

1	Take a well-known story/tale/myth (not a play) that is known to the whole group.

2	The simpler the story the better. Go for something that does not appear to have a great deal of depth or complexity: a folk-tale, fairy story, fable, etc. As we have been using Little Red Riding Hood already, I am going to stay with her in this exercise.

3	Get the facts of the story clear. Write out the story, or re-tell it round the circle. Go back and add in any details that seem necessary. In both cases, keep the narrative quite simple.

4	Write out a list of Little Red’s significant  actions  in  the  story.  Keep strictly to events as opposed to thoughts and feelings. (See Example 130.1.)

5	Rewrite or re-tell the story in a number of different ways:

●	As a rap song.

●	As a shock-horror TV news report.

●	As a speech at a feminist conference.

●	As a piece of gossip. [See Examples 130.2(a)–130.2(d).]

6	Rewrite the story in a number of different dramatic genres or forms. You can use the whole story, or certain sections of it. You can use dia- logue, narration, stage-directions, etc.

●	As a Greek tragedy, in which she is the doomed heroine.

●	As a courtroom drama, in which she is on trial for attempted murder.

●	As an urban teenage love-comedy, in which she is a streetwise  kid. [See Examples 130.3(a)–130.3(c).]

7	Look at the play you are writing. In its style and form, does it lend itself to any particular category? Are there different categories of form and style in it? Have you deliberately drawn on different genres to create specific effects, moods, etc.? Did you think you were setting out to write in one genre, when in effect the material actually lends itself to another?

8	Look at any new play that is in development.

assistant: 1. Li Mei's story is well-known among the group.

2. The story is simple, focusing on Li Mei's journey to become a top fashion designer in Hangzhou, facing challenges and overcoming obstacles along the way.

3. The group recounts Li Mei's story, ensuring that all the key events and details are clear.

4. List of Li Mei's significant actions in the story:

- Decides to pursue her dream of becoming a fashion designer

- Moves to Hangzhou to study fashion

- Develops friendships with Wu Yue and Chen Ying

- Falls in love with Zhang Wei

- Works under the guidance of Professor Liu

- Competes against her rival, Huang Shan

- Stands up to the corrupt official, Liu Taibao

5. Rewrite or re-tell Li Mei's story in different ways:

- As a rap song: Narrate Li Mei's journey through catchy rhymes and verses, emphasizing her resilience and determination.

- As a shock-horror TV news report: Describe Li Mei's confrontation with Liu Taibao as a sensationalized scandal, exposing corruption and abuse of power.

- As a speech at a feminist conference: Highlight Li Mei's struggles as a woman in a male-dominated society, emphasizing her strength and courage in the face of adversity.

- As a piece of gossip: Share Li Mei's story as a juicy tale full of drama, intrigue, and romance.

6. Rewrite Li Mei's story in different dramatic genres or forms:

- As a Greek tragedy: Li Mei's journey takes on a darker tone, where her ambition ultimately leads to her downfall.

- As a courtroom drama: Li Mei is put on trial for her defiance against Liu Taibao, and her friends and allies testify on her behalf, revealing the depth of the corruption she exposed.

- As an urban teenage love-comedy: Li Mei's story becomes a lighthearted coming-of-age tale, focusing on her relationships with Zhang Wei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying as they navigate life in the city.

7. Consider the play you are writing. In Li Mei's story, elements of social drama, romance, and thriller are blended to create a unique narrative. The story might have initially been intended as a simple tale of ambition, but the inclusion of various relationships, conflicts, and themes has transformed it into a more complex and engaging narrative.

8. When working on a new play, it's essential to consider the genre, style, and form that best suit the story being told. By experimenting with different genres and forms, you can discover new ways to present your narrative, creating a more dynamic and engaging experience for the audience.

user: assess the outcome

Outcome

By investigating the story and by identifying its major actions (steps 3 and 4 in the exercise), we discovered that beneath its simple surface, it offered the possibilities for a tale that can be retold in a range of ways. Each experiment with genre and form revealed layers to the story, all of which throw different lights upon it. All of them are valid as a means of telling the story.

In Waiting for Godot, Estragon and Vladimir at one point go into a music hall comedy routine with hats. The play ends with Estragon’s trousers falling down. These things happen in a play where the protagonists are clearly on the edge of some sort of despair about their lives. Chekhov calls The Seagull ‘a comedy’, although everyone is clearly unhappy and one of the protagonists shoots himself at the end.

When we are building our story, it is well worth asking ourselves what genres we are playing with and why.  When someone asks ‘what type      of play are you writing?’ we may not be able to say ‘it’s a tragedy’ or

‘it’s a comedy’, but it does help if we have an idea ourselves of the genre- devices that we are using. Back to Polonius, perhaps?

assistant: In the exercise with Li Mei's story, we explored various ways to retell the narrative by experimenting with different genres and forms. This process helped us to uncover hidden layers and complexities within the seemingly simple tale. Each retelling offered a new perspective on the story, highlighting different aspects of the characters, relationships, and themes.

By incorporating elements of comedy and tragedy, plays like "Waiting for Godot" and "The Seagull" create a rich tapestry of human experience. Similarly, Li Mei's story can benefit from the blending of genres and devices, making it more dynamic and engaging for the audience.

Understanding the genre-devices used in a play is crucial for both the playwright and the audience. When asked about the type of play being written, having a clear idea of the genre and style will help communicate the play's intentions and guide its development. In the case of Li Mei's story, being aware of the various genre-devices employed will allow the playwright to create a narrative that balances tragedy and comedy, providing a more profound and authentic exploration of the human experience.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

STORY-TYPES

We  have seen that we are always drawing on forms of the comic and  the tragic, even if those two genres do not exist today in a pure sense. It is also useful to ask ourselves what ‘type’ of story we are telling. It has been said that there are only a very limited number of story-types, and that they can be found in all cultures. I am not sure if there is a definitive list of story-types, but here are some I have identified. Add your own suggestions to these. Ask yourself if your own play leans towards any of them.

●	The revenge story. Jacobean plays, such as The Revengers Tragedy, come to mind, although revenge stories  can  also  be  comic:  classic  French farce can revolve around the cuckolded husband taking revenge for his humiliation.

●	The redemption story. Those stories in which the protagonist redeems herself from a life of sin, or from past mistakes. Schiller’s Mary Stuart, in which the Queen goes to the scaffold as a martyr to her faith, hav- ing risen above the follies of her life, is an example. Timberlake Wertenbaker’s Our Country’s Good is about the redeeming nature of creativity. Shakespeare’s As You Like It can be seen as the depiction of the redeeming power of love. It is also a good example of a play in which the types of play are mixed: it begins as a potential revenge- tragedy and moves into the area of ‘pastoral-comical’.

●	The rite-of-passage story. Stories in which the protagonist faces a test or series of tests in order to grow and develop as a human being. Little  Red Riding Hood and many folk-tales from around the world figure largely here.

●	The quest story. Those stories in which the protagonist seeks the object or the answer that will solve a major life-problem. Oedipus is on a quest to solve a riddle, the answer to which will prove his downfall. The knights of King Arthur set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail. In Tennessee Williams’ Camino Real, Kilroy is on a quest to discover how to leave the place he is trapped in.

●	The mistaken identity story. In Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, the charac- ters discover who they truly are through being seen as who they are not. Mistaken identity or transformation into other beings – often animals – feature in folk-tales and myths across the world (often in the form of rite-of-passage stories).

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's explore the different story-types mentioned above and see how they might apply to her narrative.

1. The revenge story: A potential revenge storyline in Li Mei's story could involve Li Mei seeking vengeance against the corrupt official Liu Taibao, who tries to force her into being his mistress. This revenge could take the form of Li Mei exposing his corruption or finding a way to bring about his downfall. The revenge element can be infused with comedy or drama, depending on the tone the playwright wishes to set.

2. The redemption story: Li Mei's narrative could focus on her journey of redemption as she overcomes her humble beginnings and strict upbringing to achieve her dream of becoming a top fashion designer. Throughout this journey, she may face various challenges and make mistakes, but ultimately, she redeems herself through hard work, determination, and the support of her friends and mentor, Professor Liu.

3. The rite-of-passage story: Li Mei's story could be seen as a rite-of-passage tale, where she navigates the challenges of life in the city and the fashion industry, as well as her personal relationships. These challenges serve as a series of tests that help Li Mei grow and mature as a person, ultimately leading her to become a successful fashion designer and gain a deeper understanding of herself and her place in the world.

4. The quest story: Li Mei's journey to become a top fashion designer in the city can be seen as a quest. Along the way, she encounters various obstacles and meets people who help or hinder her progress. Her quest may involve not only achieving professional success but also finding personal fulfillment and happiness, as she learns to balance her dreams, relationships, and family expectations.

5. The mistaken identity story: In Li Mei's story, there could be a subplot involving mistaken identity. For example, Li Mei or one of her friends might be mistaken for someone else, leading to a series of comedic or dramatic events that ultimately reveal deeper truths about the characters and their relationships. This mistaken identity could also serve as a catalyst for Li Mei's growth and self-discovery, as she comes to understand herself and her desires more fully through the experiences she faces.

By examining these different story-types, the playwright can better understand the various narrative possibilities and layers within Li Mei's story. These story-types can be combined or adapted to create a unique and engaging tale that resonates with the audience and provides a rich exploration of Li Mei's journey.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

There are also categories of plays that are culturally specific  in  their form and content. Some of them are very local, and are a shorthand acknowledgement of a type of play that comes out of a certain geography  or climate. Again, it may be useful to consider if your own play draws upon or resonates with any of these, or any other categories you might add to  the ones I suggest here.

●	The Jamaican ‘yard play’. Stories that are set in the communal back- yard, where all social interactions take place – a sort of democratic space in which the lives of the characters are played out, and in which some European notions of ‘privacy’ do not. Moon On A Rainbow Shawl, by Errol John, is an example of such a play.

●	The ‘prairie porch play’. I came across this when working in Winnipeg, Canada. This is a type of play set (like the Jamaican ‘yard play’) in a climate that encourages people to spend a great deal of time sitting outside on the open veranda.

●	The ‘kitchen sink play’. This – slightly derogatory – term was attached to a type of play that emerged in the UK in the 1950s. They were plays by the generation that included Arnold Wesker, which depicted work- ing class characters in their domestic surroundings: a revolt against the previous generations of middle-class plays set in drawing rooms.

●	The ‘street-cred’ play. Plays that depict young, urban life in Western culture. Often fast-moving and with an edge of violence, borrowing from the rhythms of film and television.

●	Masque, pageant and ceremonial plays. Formal works, often drawing upon specific cultural rituals.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's explore some culturally specific categories of plays and see how they might apply to her narrative.

1. The Jamaican 'yard play': While Li Mei's story is not set in Jamaica, the concept of a communal space where social interactions take place can still be applied. For example, Li Mei's story could be centered around a shared workshop, studio, or marketplace in Hangzhou, where characters interact and their lives become intertwined. This setting would allow the exploration of various relationships and conflicts in a democratic space, much like the Jamaican 'yard play.'

2. The 'prairie porch play': Similar to the Jamaican 'yard play,' Li Mei's story could take place in a setting that encourages people to spend time outdoors, such as a scenic lakeside in Hangzhou or a public park where people gather to socialize, practice traditional crafts, or engage in artistic activities. This setting could provide a backdrop for the characters' interactions and their personal growth.

3. The 'kitchen sink play': Although the term 'kitchen sink play' is specific to the UK context, the idea of a play focusing on working-class characters in domestic settings could be relevant to Li Mei's story. The play could depict the daily lives and struggles of Li Mei, her friends, and her family in their homes and workplaces, offering an authentic portrayal of their experiences and aspirations.

4. The 'street-cred' play: Li Mei's story could be adapted into a 'street-cred' play, focusing on the urban life of young people in Hangzhou as they navigate the challenges of the fashion industry, relationships, and personal ambitions. The play could incorporate elements of contemporary culture, such as popular music, fashion trends, and social issues, while maintaining an energetic pace and a sense of realism.

5. Masque, pageant, and ceremonial plays: Li Mei's story could incorporate elements of traditional Chinese culture, rituals, and ceremonies. For instance, a key scene might take place during a traditional Chinese festival, a fashion show inspired by ancient Chinese aesthetics, or a qipao competition where the characters showcase their designs. These cultural elements could enrich the narrative and provide a unique context for the characters' development.

By considering these culturally specific categories of plays, the playwright can experiment with different approaches to Li Mei's story, drawing upon various cultural traditions and forms to create a unique and engaging narrative.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

THE HAIKU

Finally, here is an exercise that you can use at any stage of the writing process, but which is particularly useful when you are working on draft two. This is when – as we have seen – you want to be clear on the follow- ing points: what is the scene, act or play really about, really saying, really doing? What is the heart and essence of it?

The haiku [hy-koo] is a form of Japanese verse. It aims to capture the essence of a natural object or a view of nature in one single impression. There are three lines (unrhymed). The first line has five syllables, the second has seven syllables, and the third has five syllables.

1	Performance projects

Much of the work in this book can feed into the creation of large-scale performance projects and devised work: school, college, community, etc. Exercises 11–13 can for example, as we have seen, culminate with the pre- sentation of group-written poems. These could be developed further, with the addition of music, movement, costume, etc. I have seen material from these and other exercises become the basis for some wonderful school assembly presentations, or the basis from which a song-cycle has devel- oped. I recently used some of these exercises with a community group to create the material for a large-scale sung performance piece.

EXERCISES INTO PROJECT

We have seen how some of the single exercises from Chapter 1 can in themselves be the basis for whole large-scale performance, offering (a) a structure and (b) a theme. Here are a few examples of how such exercises can be developed.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we can create a large-scale performance project using the exercises from this book as a foundation. Let's take the example of Exercise 11, which focuses on creating group-written poems. These poems can be based on the themes and emotions present in Li Mei's journey as a fashion designer.

1. Developing Poems:

Gather a group of participants and have them brainstorm and write poems about Li Mei's struggles, relationships, and growth as a fashion designer in Hangzhou. These poems can touch on themes such as ambition, love, friendship, rivalry, and overcoming adversity.

2. Adding Music:

Compose or select music that complements the emotions and themes present in the poems. Participants can work together to create melodies and harmonies that enhance the impact of the poetry.

3. Incorporating Movement and Dance:

Choreograph movements or dances that embody the emotions and themes of Li Mei's story. These movements can be integrated with the recitation of the poems and the music, creating a cohesive performance piece.

4. Costume and Set Design:

Design costumes and sets that represent the characters, settings, and emotions in Li Mei's story. The costumes can range from traditional qipao to modern fashion designs, reflecting Li Mei's journey from her village roots to becoming a top fashion designer in the city.

5. Performance:

Combine all of these elements (poetry, music, movement, and design) to present a large-scale performance project that tells Li Mei's story. This performance can be showcased in a school assembly, community event, or even as a theatrical production.

In summary, using exercises from the book as a starting point, Li Mei's story can be transformed into a multi-faceted performance project that explores her journey, relationships, and the themes of ambition, love, and overcoming adversity. By incorporating poetry, music, movement, and design, participants can create a memorable and engaging performance that brings Li Mei's story to life.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 137 The journey round the circle

Participants: All groups, individual

Look at Exercise 27 in Chapter 1. Use this as a basis for creating a large- group play. Begin with the following structure:

Scene One:	Character A + Character B. Scene Two:	Character B + Character C.

Scene Three: Character C + Character D.

And so on until the object returns to Character A.

This is an ideal structure for a process that gives everyone an opportunity to create their own dramatic moment and can be developed in any number of ways:

●	In the example in Chapter 1, a pair of scissors was used. Experiment with different objects. Decide upon one that offers the most interesting possibilities, in terms of its own history or properties: a mask, a hat, a book, etc. If it is a mask, what type of mask is it exactly? Where is it from? What does it represent? If a book, what is in it, what does it offer?

●	Decide upon the geographical location of the journey the object takes: within your locality, within one country, global, etc. Create a map of the journey on the floor.

●	What dramatic possibilities do the different locations offer?

●	Develop the characters and the dialogue, using exercises from Chapters 1 and 5. How do the characters change through the action? What effect does the object have on their lives and the choices they make?

●	What time frame does the whole story take place in? A day? A week? A year? If there are twelve stories, do we follow them from midday to midnight, for example?

●	Experiment with different styles for each scene: comedy, tragedy, thriller, pantomime, etc. Add music, movement and song.

●	Each scene has two main characters. Bring in other characters where useful.

●	Experiment with having a range of small, intimate scenes and large crowd-scenes.

●	Each small scene will have its own theme or issue (see Chapters 3 and 4). List them all. What large theme or issue is suggested by all of them? Could this suggest rewrites, to make this bolder and clearer?

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we can create a large-group play using the journey round the circle exercise. We'll choose an object that has significance within Li Mei's story and represents her journey as a fashion designer. Let's choose a beautiful, hand-embroidered silk scarf that Li Mei designed.

Scene Structure:

Scene One: Li Mei + Wu Yue

Scene Two: Wu Yue + Chen Ying

Scene Three: Chen Ying + Zhang Wei

Scene Four: Zhang Wei + Professor Liu

Scene Five: Professor Liu + Huang Shan

Scene Six: Huang Shan + Liu Taibao

Scene Seven: Liu Taibao + Li Jilai

Scene Eight: Li Jilai + Li Mei

Geographical Location:

The journey takes place in Hangzhou, China, showcasing different locations within the city, such as the fashion school, traditional qipao store, and various homes of the characters.

Dramatic Possibilities:

Each location offers unique dramatic opportunities, such as the tension between Li Mei and her rival Huang Shan at the qipao store, or the conflict between Li Mei and the villain Liu Taibao.

Character Development and Dialogue:

The characters' relationships and personal growth can be explored through dialogue and interactions. The silk scarf can represent the characters' connections, dreams, and aspirations.

Time Frame:

The play could take place over several weeks, with each scene representing a different stage in Li Mei's journey.

Different Styles:

Experiment with different styles for each scene, such as a comedy for Li Mei and Wu Yue's friendship, a romantic scene with Zhang Wei, and a dramatic confrontation between Li Mei and Liu Taibao.

Additional Characters:

Introduce other characters relevant to the story, such as fellow students, customers, or family members.

Small and Large Scenes:

Incorporate a mix of intimate scenes between two characters and larger crowd scenes, such as a fashion show or a confrontation in a public space.

Themes and Issues:

Each scene will tackle different themes, such as friendship, rivalry, love, mentorship, and family. The overarching theme could be about following one's dreams, staying true to oneself, and overcoming adversity. Rewrites can be made to emphasize these themes more clearly.

By following this structure and considering the various elements, a compelling play can be created based on Li Mei's story, showcasing the various relationships and experiences that shape her journey as an aspiring fashion designer in Hangzhou, China.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 138 Further large-scale performance

Participants: All groups

I have already noted the fact that you can use this book as a ‘dip-in’ resource, as well as a step-by-step guide to creating a play. For those of you wishing to create a large-scale performance, I recommend Exercises 43–53 and 91–93 as ideal holding-forms. The structure of each exercise

provides the basis for:

●	Individual scenes and characters.

●	Interwoven stories and  episodes.

●	Changing locations and theatrical moods.

●	The introduction of music and movement.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we can create a large-scale performance using exercises 43-53 and 91-93 as holding-forms to develop a compelling play. These exercises offer a structure for individual scenes, interwoven stories, changing locations, and the introduction of music and movement. Here's a suggested outline:

Scene One: Li Mei's Village (Exercise 43 - Dream Talk)

- Li Mei shares her dream of becoming a top fashion designer with her best friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying.

Scene Two: Fashion School (Exercise 46 - The Interview)

- Li Mei is interviewed by Professor Liu, who becomes her mentor, and begins her journey in the fashion world.

Scene Three: Exploring Hangzhou (Exercise 91 - Location, Location)

- Li Mei, Wu Yue, and Chen Ying explore the city and its various fashion-related locations, providing a glimpse of Hangzhou's cultural richness.

Scene Four: Rivalry with Huang Shan (Exercise 49 - The Duel)

- Li Mei faces her rival, Huang Shan, in a fashion competition. They showcase their skills in designing and creating qipaos.

Scene Five: Romance with Zhang Wei (Exercise 50 - Love Talk)

- Li Mei and her lover, Zhang Wei, express their feelings for each other and navigate their relationship in the midst of Li Mei's pursuit of her dreams.

Scene Six: Conflict with Liu Taibao (Exercise 93 - The Trial)

- Li Mei confronts the villainous Liu Taibao, who tries to force her to be his mistress. She bravely refuses and stands up against his corruption.

Scene Seven: Family Struggles (Exercise 53 - Family Talk)

- Li Mei deals with her strict father, Li Jilai, who has mixed feelings about her dream of becoming a top fashion designer in the city.

Scene Eight: The Climax (Exercise 52 - The Temptation)

- Li Mei faces a difficult decision, torn between her dreams, her relationships, and her integrity. Ultimately, she makes a choice that defines her future.

Scene Nine: The Finale (Exercise 43 - Dream Talk revisited)

- Li Mei, surrounded by her friends, lover, mentor, and family, reflects on her journey and the future of her dreams.

Throughout the play, music and movement can be integrated into various scenes, highlighting the cultural aspects of Hangzhou and the fashion world, as well as adding emotional depth to the story.

By combining these exercises and building upon Li Mei's story, a large-scale performance can be crafted that showcases her journey as an aspiring fashion designer, highlighting the challenges she faces and the relationships that support her along the way.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 139 Adapting from the original

Participants: All groups, individual

Stories that already exist can provide a basis and structure for group- devised work. Look at Exercise 130 in Chapter 8.

This exercise explored in a full way the possibilities of re-telling a well- known story in a variety of ways. I first used Little Red Riding Hood in this manner in a summer school for actors. We created a travelling perfor- mance, through the grounds and gardens of the building we were work- ing in, taking the audience through the history of Little Red as seen through different eyes: as a revolutionary figure, as a Greek heroine, as a temptress, as a destroyer of wolves, etc. Beyond having great fun playing with different genres, we were exploring how ‘the way the story is told’ is crucial to how the story is received.

The adaptation of existing stories has a long and honourable history: Shakespeare indeed lifted many of his plots from previous works. As in the exercise, you can divide into groups and re-rewrite a known play or story, in different ways, or from different points of view. All or any of these can become the basis for a scripted performance. Other angles on this method can include:

●	What happens next? Take a story and write what becomes of the char- acter(s) after the original ending. What is Red Riding Hood’s next adventure?

●	Write the scene(s) that do not appear in the story. How did Macbeth and Lady Macbeth meet?

●	Get the characters from different stories to meet each other. Red Riding Hood meets the witches from Macbeth!

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, we can adapt the exercise to create a group-devised work based on her journey as an aspiring fashion designer. Using the adaptation techniques mentioned in the exercise, here are some ways to explore Li Mei's story:

1. Rewrite a known story with Li Mei as the central character:

- Adapt a classic story or play (e.g., Cinderella or Pygmalion) to include Li Mei and her journey to become a top fashion designer in Hangzhou, incorporating elements from her life, relationships, and the challenges she faces.

2. Explore what happens next:

- After Li Mei achieves her dreams and becomes a successful fashion designer, what new challenges and adventures does she encounter? How do her relationships with Wu Yue, Chen Ying, Zhang Wei, Professor Liu, and others evolve?

3. Write the unseen scenes from Li Mei's life:

- Dive deeper into the characters and their relationships, such as how Li Mei met her mentor, Professor Liu, or her first encounter with her rival, Huang Shan.

4. Create a crossover with characters from different stories:

- Imagine Li Mei meeting a well-known character from another story (e.g., Mulan, a warrior who disguises herself as a man to save her father). How would their encounter impact each other's lives, and how would their experiences and perspectives influence one another?

By adapting and expanding upon Li Mei's story using these techniques, the group-devised work can offer new perspectives and insights into her journey, while also exploring broader themes such as ambition, resilience, and the power of relationships.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

TWINNING

One method I have used as the basis for drama activity and the development of performance has been that of ‘twinning’ different groups in a creative

process. I have used it in many contexts; it employs much of the work out- lined in this book, and may be of use to those of you involved in leading adventurous, large-scale drama projects.

In 1992, I developed a project with Theatre Centre (a leading producer of professional theatre for young people) to work with two contrasting pri- mary schools. One school was set in the rural flatlands of Norfolk, the other in the centre of Nottingham. The contrast between the backgrounds of the children could not have been more different: all-white and very sheltered from the world; culturally very diverse and exposed to all aspects of modern city life.

The project was called Young Voices, and was led by myself and Theatre Centre’s Education Officer, Becky Chapman. The basic aspirations of the project were:

●	To create a new piece of work, fully developed with, and finally performed by, the pupils, which would grow from their concerns and imaginations, under the guidance of professional theatre-makers.

●	To offer a process through which the two schools would collaborate (at long range) with each other in the construction of a joint narrative.

●	To develop thorough working-relations with each school and its staff, and provide a committed input into the life of the school as a whole.

Over a six-month period we worked in both schools for select periods of time, travelling between the two and forwarding the work. The key to the initial exchanges between the schools was many of the exercises in Chapter 1: exercises that enabled these two very different groups of people to get to know each other: Exercises 15, 16, 17, 19 and 22 for example.

In terms of finding a common starting point for a shared narrative, we knew that we wanted something that provided the basis for a strong struc- ture, but wished to keep things as open as possible. We opted for the ‘what happens next?’ structure: an existing story (one of my own plays, in fact) that concluded in a manner that contained the seeds of a range of possible dramatic avenues.

Much of the work we offered to the groups will be familiar to you now: journeys, the passing of objects from hand to hand (and group to group), mapping territories, creating rich and diverse characters. At all stages of the process the collaborative nature of the twinning was the focus. The nature of the twinning – two contrasting groups – gave rise very naturally to the theme of ‘tribes’, and thereby to matters of difference, conflict of interests, contrast of customs and history, meetings and outcomes. The outcome of the process entirely reflected the outcome of the play: the meeting of tribes to share their similarities and confront their differences. The collectively created play was presented in each school, with very dif- ferent productions; after which the schools met at an arts centre midway

between the two and shared the work. This was the biggest learning moment of all, when two groups who had not yet met, but who had come  to know each other through a shared creative process, finally came face to face. Then to see how one story – the story that was theirs – could be told  in such a vastly different way.

Since then, I have used the twinning process in many other contexts, nationally and internationally. It is certainly a process through which groups of people from vastly different backgrounds can experience being shared ‘citizens of the world’, and I recommend it as a unique learning process. It can also be applied on a smaller, more local level: between classes or year-groups, between younger and older groups of citizens. It is one model of how the process of drama, and the event of theatre, can celebrate our differences and nourish what we hold in common.

We have just seen how exercises can become the basis for the creation of material for large-scale work. Each group will arrive at what is at the heart of the performance, in terms of what it is ‘about’. By this I mean what the ‘issue’ (subject matter) and the ‘themes’ (underlying values) are. These are areas that lie at the heart of all written texts for performance, be it the group-devised play concerning an aspect of community history, or the individual play written for the main stage. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the distinction between the two.

assistant: Using the "twinning" method in the context of Li Mei's story, you can create a collaborative drama project that connects two different groups. For this example, we can imagine a group of students from a rural village (like Li Mei's hometown) and a group from an urban city (like Hangzhou) working together to develop a play about Li Mei's journey.

1. Start with exercises to help the groups get to know each other:

- Share cultural experiences, personal stories, or artistic influences that may inform their perspectives on Li Mei's story.

2. Choose a common starting point for a shared narrative:

- Select a key moment from Li Mei's story that both groups can relate to or find interesting (e.g., Li Mei's decision to pursue her dream, her encounter with Liu Taibao, or the competition with her rival, Huang Shan).

3. Develop the play using familiar techniques:

- Have the two groups explore Li Mei's story through journeys, passing objects that represent her dreams or challenges, mapping her experiences in both the village and the city, and creating diverse characters connected to her life.

4. Focus on the theme of "tribes" and differences:

- Highlight the contrasts between Li Mei's rural upbringing and her life in the city, and the challenges she faces as she navigates different worlds, customs, and expectations.

5. Present the play in both settings:

- Each group presents their version of the play in their respective locations, emphasizing their unique perspectives and interpretations of Li Mei's story.

6. Share the work and reflect:

- Bring the two groups together to watch each other's performances, discuss their differences, and celebrate their shared creative process.

By using the twinning method in the context of Li Mei's story, you can encourage groups from different backgrounds to collaborate on a creative project, learn from each other, and explore the themes of cultural differences, ambition, and resilience in a meaningful way.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

1	Getting going and warming up

Actors begin rehearsals with a physical and vocal warm-up. This helps them to clear the body and the mind of daily distractions and tensions, focus them on the space they are in and prepare them for the task in hand. Writers also need strategies to clear themselves of the clutter and access the open channel between the mind, the hand and the sheet of paper (or the screen). This might include some sort of physical activity; a friend of mine, who writes at home but needs to separate her work from the washing-up, does the morn- ing domestic routine, then goes out for a walk and eventually ‘walks to work’. If I am working with a group, I will generally start with some sort of physi- cal activity or game. Even then, the blank page (or screen) can still be sitting there, waiting for the words that refuse to come, and some form of kick-start writing activity can be useful. What follows are a range of exercises designed to stimulate the ‘writing-muscle’. The first few are general ‘warm-up’ exer- cises. I will then move on to ‘introductory’ exercises for work that will be dealt with in greater detail in the following chapters. The chapter may be used in a range of ways according to your needs, for example:

●	As a template for an introductory course in playwrighting.

●	As a menu from which to construct a one-off workshop.

●	As a stimulus for a group-devising process.

●	As a range of ‘getting-going’ exercises for when you have come back from your morning walk.

MEMORY

Writing is, as much as anything, an act of memory. Not necessarily as a recording of your own life and history, but rather as an attempt to capture  in words impressions made on the senses by the world around us. What

did that type of rain feel like? What was that woman’s unusual way of expressing herself ? What made the journey to work or school today different from any other of those journeys?

assistant: Using the 'Memory' exercise from the warm-up section in the context of Li Mei's story, the participants can tap into their own memories to create a vivid and authentic portrayal of Li Mei's world. This exercise helps writers and performers access their senses, emotions, and experiences to bring the story to life.

Example:

1. Begin by having participants find a comfortable position and close their eyes.

2. Ask them to think of a time when they had to make a difficult decision or face a challenge, similar to Li Mei's choice to pursue her dream of becoming a top fashion designer.

3. Instruct participants to recall every detail of that memory, including the weather, the surroundings, the emotions they felt, and any sounds or smells associated with the moment.

4. After a few minutes, have participants open their eyes and write down their memories in as much detail as possible.

5. Encourage them to share their memories with the group, discussing similarities and differences in the experiences.

Next, guide the participants in connecting their memories to Li Mei's story:

6. Ask participants to imagine how Li Mei might have felt when making her decision to leave her village and pursue her dream in Hangzhou. Encourage them to draw from their own experiences and memories to create a detailed description of Li Mei's emotions and surroundings at that pivotal moment.

7. Have them write down this imagined scene, using their own memories as a basis for Li Mei's emotions and sensory experiences.

8. Once everyone has completed their writing, encourage participants to share their scenes with the group. Discuss the different emotions, challenges, and sensory experiences that were evoked, and how these can be incorporated into the portrayal of Li Mei's story.

By using the 'Memory' exercise, participants can tap into their own emotions and experiences to create a more authentic, relatable portrayal of Li Mei's journey. This helps to bring the story to life and allows for a deeper connection between the characters and the audience.

user: suppose Li mei goes out for a walk around the west lake, do the following exercise

Exercise 1 Going for a walk

Participants: All groups, individual (10–30 minutes)

1	Go for a walk. Round the block, round the park, or if you are in a school, round the playground or the playing field. Be conscious of what are you seeing and hearing. Be aware of your body moving in space, the way you are breathing, the ground beneath your feet, and the air around you. What are you seeing, hearing and feeling? Hear the words in your head. Allow phrases to form themselves. Allow the rhythm of the walking to infect the rhythm of the words in your head.   If you start to speak the words, let it happen.

2	Return from your walk.

3	Write:

●	Ten things you saw.

●	Five sounds you heard.

●	Three feelings you experienced.

●	One question that is prompted by what you saw, heard or felt.

assistant: Suppose Li Mei goes for a walk around the West Lake in Hangzhou. The participants can follow the steps in Exercise 1 to immerse themselves in her experience.

1. Participants should imagine themselves as Li Mei walking around the West Lake. They should visualize the surroundings, the people, the sounds, and the sensations of her walk.

2. Once they have spent some time visualizing Li Mei's walk, participants can return to their starting point.

3. Next, participants should write down the following based on Li Mei's walk around the West Lake:

Ten things Li Mei saw:

1. The calm surface of the West Lake reflecting the sky.

2. A willow tree gently swaying in the breeze.

3. A group of tourists taking pictures of the beautiful scenery.

4. A vendor selling roasted chestnuts by the lakeside.

5. A couple paddling in a traditional wooden boat.

6. An elderly man practicing Tai Chi near the water's edge.

7. A family feeding breadcrumbs to a group of ducks.

8. A stone bridge arching over a narrow canal.

9. A vibrant patch of blooming lotus flowers.

10. A traditional pavilion overlooking the lake.

Five sounds Li Mei heard:

1. The soothing sound of water lapping at the shore.

2. The distant laughter of children playing nearby.

3. The rhythmic beat of a traditional Chinese drum.

4. The gentle rustle of leaves as the wind blew through the trees.

5. The melodious song of a blackbird perched on a branch.

Three feelings Li Mei experienced:

1. A sense of tranquility and peace as she admired the beauty of the West Lake.

2. A feeling of pride and connection to her city's history and culture.

3. A surge of inspiration for her fashion designs, drawn from the natural and architectural elements around her.

One question prompted by what Li Mei saw, heard, or felt:

- How can she incorporate the beauty and harmony of the West Lake into her fashion designs to create something truly unique and representative of her hometown?

By completing this exercise, participants can gain a deeper understanding of Li Mei's character, her emotions, and her experiences. This will help them in the development of the story and the portrayal of Li Mei's journey as a fashion designer.

user: Now li mei is lying on the meadow of west lake bank, do the exercise.

Exercise 2 Lying on the grass

Participants: All groups, individual (5–10 minutes)

1	Lie on the grass in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Listen to the sounds outside the building or the room. After a minute or so, lis- ten to the sounds inside the room. Finally, listen to the sounds inside your own body. Allow your hearing-sense to travel back-and-forth between these distances, identifying the specific sounds.

2	Write:

●	The type and quality of the sounds you heard.

●	One question about anything you heard or felt.

assistant: Suppose Li Mei is lying on the meadow of the West Lake bank. Participants can follow the steps in Exercise 2 to immerse themselves in her experience.

1. Participants should imagine themselves as Li Mei lying on the grass near the West Lake. They should visualize the surroundings and focus on the sounds outside, then the sounds inside the imaginary room or space where Li Mei is lying, and finally, the sounds within Li Mei's own body.

2. Next, participants should write down the following based on Li Mei's experience lying on the meadow of the West Lake bank:

The type and quality of the sounds Li Mei heard:

- Outside sounds: gentle waves lapping the shore, distant chatter of people enjoying the park, birds singing in nearby trees, the rustling of leaves in the breeze.

- Inside sounds (imagining a nearby room or pavilion): soft footsteps on wooden floorboards, the creaking of a door opening and closing, low murmurs of conversation between visitors.

- Sounds within Li Mei's body: her steady heartbeat, slow and deep breaths, the subtle sound of swallowing.

One question about anything Li Mei heard or felt:

- How do these sounds and sensations contribute to Li Mei's sense of belonging and her connection to the West Lake, and how can they inspire her creative journey as a fashion designer?

By completing this exercise, participants can further explore Li Mei's character, her emotions, and her experiences, and use these insights to inform the development of her story as a budding fashion designer in Hangzhou.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 3 Thinking about your life Part one

Participants: All groups, individual (5–10 minutes)

1	Walk around the room (or if you are in a small space, sit somewhere comfortably). Allow yourself to feel relaxed and open. Think about

your life, the whole of it, as if it is a river running past you. Allow memories to flow past. Find something you remember that is of interest – an event, a moment, an image – and explore it. Then go and write it down, as one word, a few words or a sentence.

2	Start walking again (or sit back). Allow the river to flow again, letting the memory you have written slide away. Think of your life last year, as if it were a video. Find something of interest, something that was important or significant, and replay the scene over a few times. Summarise it in a few words or a line, then write it down.

3	Think of your life this year and repeat the process.

4	Think of your life last week and repeat the process.

5	Look at everything you have written, find three or four questions the words and phrases prompt, then write them down.

assistant: Suppose we perform Exercise 3 in the context of Li Mei's story. Participants should put themselves in Li Mei's shoes and think about her life. Follow the steps below to explore Li Mei's memories and experiences.

1. Participants should walk around the room or sit comfortably and imagine Li Mei's life as a flowing river. They should let memories come and go, then pick an interesting event, moment, or image from Li Mei's past. For example, Li Mei discovering her passion for fashion design while watching her grandmother sew traditional qipaos. Write it down as a sentence: "Grandmother sewing a qipao."

2. Next, participants should think about Li Mei's life last year. An important event could be when she decided to move to Hangzhou to pursue her dreams of becoming a top fashion designer. Write it down as a sentence: "Moved to Hangzhou for fashion."

3. For this year, participants might consider the opening of Li Mei's own fashion store and her growing success. Write it down as a sentence: "Opened my fashion store."

4. Thinking about Li Mei's life last week, participants can focus on a recent event, such as a confrontation with her rival, Huang Shan. Write it down as a sentence: "Confrontation with Huang Shan."

5. Review the written phrases and generate three or four questions based on them:

- How did Li Mei's grandmother influence her passion for fashion design?

- What challenges did Li Mei face when she moved to Hangzhou to pursue her dreams?

- How has Li Mei's fashion store impacted her life and the community around her?

- What motivates Li Mei to continue pursuing her dreams despite the rivalry with Huang Shan?

These questions can help participants dive deeper into Li Mei's character and her experiences, providing inspiration for further developing her story.

Part two – thinking about your life

Participants: All groups (10–20 minutes)

1	Begin with and complete Exercise 3 (part one).

2	Walk around the room again. Be aware of the other people in the space but work on your own.

3	Go and look at the first memory you wrote down. Close your eyes and say it to yourself. Walk around the room. Tell the memory to a chair, the window, the wall, or any other object in the room.

4	Find a partner. Listen to their memory. Repeat it and learn it. Tell your partner your memory, and they will repeat and learn it.

5	Swap memories. Forget your own memory, you have given it away. Walk around the room again, with your partner’s memory. It is now yours.

6	Everyone collect together in the middle of the room, as close as possi- ble, but without touching. Everyone has someone else’s memory. Close your eyes. Tell to the group as much of the memory as you can. Don’t rush, and avoid speaking over each other. Focus on everything that is said. Everyone will have heard all the memories now. You won’t hold all of them in your mind, just fragments, images that have stayed with you.

7	Work on your own, writing down as much as you can remember from all that has been said – words, images, phrases, scraps of informa- tion. Use these notes to write a short piece beginning ‘I remem-  ber . . . ’. Include everything you have jotted down, re-arranging and adding other words where you need to.

8	Feed the individual work back to the group. What similar/different approaches have been adopted? What images stand out most?

assistant: Let's perform Exercise 3 Part Two in the context of Li Mei's story. Participants should immerse themselves in the life of Li Mei and her acquaintances.

1. Begin with and complete Exercise 3 (part one) as previously done.

2. Have participants walk around the room, focusing on their own thoughts about Li Mei's story.

3. Participants should look at the first memory they wrote down, close their eyes, and say it to themselves. They should then walk around the room and tell the memory to different objects in the room.

4. Participants should find a partner, listen to their partner's memory, and learn it. They should then share their own memory with their partner, who will also learn it.

5. Participants should swap memories and walk around the room, treating their partner's memory as their own.

6. Gather everyone in the middle of the room, without touching. With eyes closed, each person should share their new memory with the group. Listen carefully to all the memories shared.

7. Participants should work individually, writing down as much as they can remember from the shared memories. They should use these notes to write a short piece beginning with "I remember...". This piece should include everything jotted down, rearranged, and with additional words as needed.

8. Have the participants share their individual work with the group. Discuss the similarities and differences in their approaches and which images stood out the most.

By performing this exercise, participants will gain a deeper understanding of Li Mei's story and explore different perspectives from her life. This exercise can help them develop new ideas and create a more nuanced understanding of the characters and their relationships.

user: suppose Li mei is doing the exercise, she starts to say: I remember, complete the rest monologue.

assistant: I remember the day I decided to follow my dreams and leave my small village. The feeling of excitement mixed with fear, knowing that I was stepping into the unknown. I remember the warm embrace of my mother, encouraging me to chase my dreams, while my father, Li Jilai, sternly reminded me of our family's traditions and expectations.

I remember my first day in Hangzhou, the bustling city overwhelming my senses, the smell of street food, the sound of people talking and laughing, and the vibrant colors of the cityscape. I remember meeting my best friends, Wu Yue, the talented lesbian artist with a heart full of passion, and Chen Ying, the beautiful housewife who always had a kind word and a warm smile.

I remember falling in love with Zhang Wei, his gentle touch and unwavering support as I struggled to find my place in the competitive world of fashion design. I remember the wisdom of Professor Liu, my mentor, who guided me through the challenges and helped me grow as a designer and as a person.

I remember my rivalry with Huang Shan, the owner of a traditional qipao store, our ongoing competition pushing me to become better and more innovative. But I also remember the dark shadow cast by Liu Taibao, the corrupted official who tried to force me into becoming his mistress. I remember the strength I found within myself to stand up to him and the support of my friends and lover in my refusal to submit to his wicked desires.

I remember the endless nights working on my designs, feeling the fabric between my fingers and envisioning the beautiful creations that would grace the catwalks of Hangzhou. I remember the joy and pride I felt when my first collection was finally showcased, knowing that I had come so far from the small village girl with big dreams.

As I lie here on the grass, with the gentle breeze brushing against my face, I remember all these moments and emotions that have shaped me. I am filled with gratitude and determination to continue pursuing my dreams and to become the top fashion designer in the city.

Part three – thinking about your life

Participants: All groups (6–8 minutes for each stage)

1	Repeat Exercise 3 (part two), using the memory from last year, and the memory from this year, and the memory from last week. Each time, the process of listening, remembering and then writing the final piece should become more fluid.

2	Read out the results of the task. How have people used the same material differently? Were there images that came up a few times?

assistant: 1. Memory from last year:

Li Mei shared her memory from last year: "I remember the grand opening of my fashion boutique. The red ribbon being cut and the support of my friends and family as they congratulated me on my achievement."

Other participants listened to Li Mei's memory and remembered it in their own ways. After listening, they wrote their own versions:

- I remember the celebration of a new beginning, the pride in her eyes, and the encouragement from her loved ones.

- I remember the vibrant colors, the excitement of a dream come true, and the support of those who believed in her journey.

2. Memory from this year:

Li Mei shared her memory from this year: "I remember winning a prestigious fashion design competition, further cementing my place in the fashion world of Hangzhou."

Other participants listened to Li Mei's memory and remembered it in their own ways. After listening, they wrote their own versions:

- I remember the moment of triumph, the recognition of her talent, and the elation of achieving a hard-earned goal.

- I remember the applause, the spotlight on her success, and the knowledge that her hard work and dedication had paid off.

3. Memory from last week:

Li Mei shared her memory from last week: "I remember the day I found out about Liu Taibao's plot to sabotage my business and the decision to confront him and protect my dreams."

Other participants listened to Li Mei's memory and remembered it in their own ways. After listening, they wrote their own versions:

- I remember the shock of betrayal, the determination to stand up for herself, and the courage to face adversity head-on.

- I remember the discovery of deceit, the strength in her resolve, and the unwavering commitment to her dreams and ambitions.

After sharing the results of the task, participants noticed the different ways they used the same material. Some focused on emotions, while others emphasized the events or the people involved. There were recurring images of support, determination, and triumph throughout the various memories.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 4 Personal memory and shared memory

Participants: All groups (5–10 minutes)

You can adapt Exercise 3 (parts one, two and three) to any category of memory.

For example, find these three memories:

1	A very personal memory, one which no one else in the world could have.

2	A local memory, something shared by quite a lot of people in your community, street, school, etc., but not by the wider world.

3	A world memory, something shared by many people around the globe.

assistant: 1. A very personal memory:

Li Mei thought of a personal memory that only she could have: "I remember the moment I secretly stitched my first qipao in my room, late at night, using my grandmother's old sewing machine, feeling a mix of excitement and fear."

2. A local memory:

Li Mei recalled a local memory shared by people in her community: "I remember the annual Dragon Boat Festival on the West Lake, where our community gathered to watch the colorful boats race, sharing delicious zongzi and cheering for our favorite teams."

3. A world memory:

Li Mei thought of a world memory shared by many people around the globe: "I remember watching the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, feeling a sense of pride and unity as people from different nations came together to celebrate sportsmanship and cultural exchange."

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Part two – name and character

Participants: Primary

You can use the character’s name to discover more about them.

1	Write your own name in a column down the side of the paper.

2	Write a list of things you like, beginning with each letter of the name. (See Example 19.2.)

3	Write a list of things you don’t like, again beginning with each letter of the name. (See Example 19.3.)

4	Repeat the exercise, using one of the new names you made from your own name.

5	If you are working in a group, discuss all the new characters. What clues as to who they might be are given by the ‘likes’ and ‘don’t likes’?

assistant: Let's use Li Mei's name for the exercise.

1. Write Li Mei's name in a column down the side of the paper.

L

I

M

E

I

2. Write a list of things Li Mei likes, beginning with each letter of her name.

L: Lotus flowers, which remind her of her childhood village

I: Ink drawings, as they inspire her fashion designs

M: Markets, where she finds unique fabrics and materials

E: Evening walks by the West Lake to clear her thoughts

I: Innovating traditional qipao designs to make them modern and unique

3. Write a list of things Li Mei doesn't like, again beginning with each letter of her name.

L: Li Taibao, the corrupted official who harasses her

I: Injustice, especially against women in society

M: Mediocrity in fashion design, preferring to stand out and be creative

E: Elitism in the fashion industry, which makes it difficult for newcomers

I: Ignorance, as she values knowledge and learning

4. Repeat the exercise, using one of the new names you made from Li Mei's name.

Let's use the name "Mile" as the new name.

M: Movies, enjoying the stories and inspiration they provide

I: Insects, as she finds them creepy and annoying

L: Laziness, believing in hard work and determination

E: Egotism, disliking people who are self-centered and arrogant

5. If you are working in a group, discuss all the new characters. What clues as to who they might be are given by the 'likes' and 'don't likes'?

In a group discussion, we can see that Li Mei is a person who values creativity, uniqueness, and hard work. She is inspired by nature and the beauty around her. In contrast, "Mile" appreciates storytelling and entertainment but dislikes certain aspects of human nature, such as laziness and egotism. The likes and dislikes help to create a more vivid image of both Li Mei and Mile as characters with distinct personalities, interests, and values.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 20 Characteristics

Participants: All groups, individual (4 minutes)

Definition of ‘characteristic’: ‘a distinguishing quality, attribute or trait’; that is, moods, emotions, and ways of behaving that you associate with a person.

1	Write a list of single words you might use to describe qualities of character in a person. (See Examples 20.1.)

2	Look at the list. Find pairs of words that seem to contradict each other. Write thumbnail character sketches in which the person is described as having a range of characteristics. (See Examples 20.2.)

assistant: 1. List of single words to describe qualities of character in a person:

Ambitious, confident, empathetic, passionate, stubborn, reserved, artistic, introverted, extroverted, courageous, cautious, generous, disciplined, impatient, optimistic, pessimistic, loyal, manipulative, independent, dependent, romantic, pragmatic, curious, self-centered, resilient, envious, humble, arrogant, creative, traditional, gentle, assertive, meticulous, spontaneous, humorous, serious, adaptable, rigid.

2. Pairs of contradicting words:

Ambitious and cautious

Stubborn and adaptable

Introverted and extroverted

Disciplined and spontaneous

Optimistic and pessimistic

Loyal and manipulative

Romantic and pragmatic

Curious and rigid

Humble and arrogant

Gentle and assertive

Thumbnail character sketches for Li Mei and other characters in the story:

Li Mei: Ambitious yet cautious, Li Mei is determined to be the top fashion designer in the city, but she is careful not to make too many risky decisions. She's passionate about her art and meticulous in her designs, balancing both creativity and tradition. Despite being an introvert, she can be assertive when facing challenges, such as standing up against the villain, Liu Taibao.

Wu Yue: Extroverted and empathetic, Wu Yue is a lesbian artist who uses her art to express her emotions and connect with others. She's spontaneous, humorous, and enjoys exploring new experiences. Wu Yue is a fiercely loyal friend to Li Mei and Chen Ying, always there to support them in their endeavors.

Chen Ying: Chen Ying is a beautiful housewife who is gentle and nurturing, yet she possesses an inner strength and resilience that people often underestimate. She is curious about the world and dreams of exploring beyond her current life, while remaining grounded in her responsibilities.

Zhang Wei: Zhang Wei is Li Mei's lover and a romantic at heart, but he's also pragmatic when it comes to their relationship and their future together. He is loyal, dependable, and supportive, always trying to encourage Li Mei in her pursuit of her dreams.

Liu Taibao: The villain of the story, Liu Taibao is a greedy, lustful, and manipulative corrupted official. He is arrogant and self-centered, using his power to try to force Li Mei to be his mistress. Despite his power, he is also cautious, as he tries to find ways to take revenge on Li Mei without directly implicating himself.

user: assess the outcome in the context of Li Mei's story

Outcome

A ‘daft’ person might be interesting in a story, as might a ‘wise’ person. But a person who is ‘daft but wise’ is going to be very interesting. Shakespeare’s clowns are often the wisest characters in the plays.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, having characters with seemingly contradictory qualities adds depth and complexity to the narrative, making it more engaging and thought-provoking.

For instance, Li Mei is both ambitious and cautious, which creates an interesting tension in her journey to become a top fashion designer. This internal conflict may lead her to make tough decisions, balancing her dreams with her need to be careful and practical.

Wu Yue, as a wise and empathetic friend, offers support and guidance to Li Mei, despite her spontaneous and extroverted nature. This combination of traits makes her an engaging character who can provide both levity and wisdom in the story.

Similarly, Chen Ying's gentle and nurturing qualities, juxtaposed with her inner strength and resilience, make her character more complex and interesting. Her curiosity and desire to explore beyond her current life can lead to unexpected turns in the story.

Even the villain, Liu Taibao, is not a one-dimensional character. His greed and lust are counterbalanced by his caution, adding an element of cunning and calculation to his actions, which makes him a more formidable antagonist.

Overall, the presence of characters with contradictory qualities in Li Mei's story enhances the narrative and creates a richer, more engaging experience for readers. These complex characters contribute to the story's depth and provide opportunities for surprising plot twists, emotional growth, and thought-provoking themes.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 21 Type

Participants: All groups, individual (5 minutes)

Definition of ‘type’: ‘a person who typifies a particular quality’. This is slightly different from ‘characteristic’ in that it suggests that the quality identified is more central to the way the person is generally.

1	Write a list of popular or common phrases that are used to describe what type of person a character is. (See Examples 21.1.)

2	Using the ‘daft but wise’ examples in Exercise 20, create descriptions of characters that include (a) two ‘characteristic’ words and (b) ‘type’ phrases. (See Examples 21.2.)

3	Write a list of phrases that characters might use to describe them-  selves. (See Examples 21.3.)

- A dreamer with a goal

- A strict disciplinarian

- A creative soul

- Liu Taibao: "I'm a powerful man who takes what he wants, and I don't like to be refused."

user: assess the outcome  in the context of Li Mei's story

Outcome

●	We have now begun to explore the possibility that a ‘character’ may have different sides to them, often contradictory ones. Their ‘type’ may be the dominant expression of how they are, but that may con- tain many other shades and variations.

●	In a play, people describe other people. They also describe them- selves. The two might be very contradictory. As we shall see in Chapter 4, what characters say about themselves may be very much at odds with what someone else says about them.

assistant: Outcome assessment in the context of Li Mei's story:

● The exercise has helped us explore the multifaceted nature of the characters in Li Mei's story. Each character has a dominant 'type,' but they also possess various qualities, emotions, and traits that create a more complex and engaging character. This complexity adds depth and realism to the story.

● In Li Mei's story, as in a play, characters describe themselves and others. These descriptions can sometimes contradict each other, which adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative. For example, Li Mei's father, Li Jilai, may see himself as a loving and caring father who values tradition, while Li Mei may view him as overly strict and uncompromising. Similarly, Huang Shan, Li Mei's rival, may see themselves as a fair competitor, while Li Mei might perceive them as a cunning and aggressive opponent.

Through this exercise, we have enriched the character development in Li Mei's story and highlighted the importance of considering various perspectives and contradictions in the descriptions and actions of characters. This deepened understanding will make the narrative more engaging and relatable for the audience.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor.

Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 22 What’s in a name?

Participants: All groups, individual (5–10 minutes)

You will eventually put a name to all the characters in your play or story. This is no light matter; no lighter than when your own parents or guardians gave you a name. We are very much defined by our names and they are centrally bound up with our self-identity and our personal history. It is no coincidence that when oppressors decide to eradicate the identities of those they oppress, one of the first things they often do is eradicate origi- nal names. The slave-owners in America gave their slaves westernised names; in 1930s Germany, all Jewish women had to register under the name of ‘Sarah’. How about all those true stories of people wanting to make a new life for themselves, and in doing so have changed their names?

All this may seem very far from the question of how to build a character for a fictional story, but an examination of our own names throws a great deal of light upon that matter, and this is what this exercise is based upon. A friend once sent me a birthday card with an African saying on it: ‘If you

can walk you can dance, if you can talk you can sing.’ I add a third thing: ‘If you can write your name you can tell a story.’

1	Write your name and the things you know and feel about it. (See Example 22.1.)

2	Take from your account of your name a few elements that feel key and use them to create a poem, reordering them in a manner that feels satisfying. In this way, you will have created a boiled-down essence of ‘you’. (See Example 22.2.)

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, let's do the exercise:

1. Name: Li Mei

- Li is her family name, a common Chinese surname.

- Mei means "beautiful" or "pretty" in Chinese.

- She was named by her parents with the hope that she would grow up to be a beautiful, kind-hearted person.

- Mei is a simple, yet elegant name that reflects her passion for fashion and beauty.

- The name also connects her to her Chinese heritage and family roots.

2. Poem:

From the roots of Li, a family's name,

Mei blossoms into beauty, their aim.

In a village small, where dreams are born,

A passion for fashion takes its form.

Heritage embraced in every letter,

Elegance and grace, her name's sender.

Mei, a name that tells a tale,

Of dreams and love in rich detail.

user: assess the outcome  in the context of Li Mei's story

Outcome

Simply by using our names as the controlling factor, we have revealed quite a lot about ourselves. Nine-year old Minh’s view on himself uses a lot of imagery, while mine was more autobiographical, but both include personal history, family history, ethnic origins, etc. The exercise reveals a huge amount about what we mean by ‘creating a character’: our fictional characters need to have as rich a history as our own lives have. Just as our own stories can be told through our names, so too should the stories of our fictional characters. We have seen how ‘character’ and ‘story’ are inextricably linked.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the exercise we completed by examining her name and creating a poem has helped us understand her character more deeply. The outcome shows that:

- Li Mei's name is connected to her family and Chinese heritage, giving her a sense of identity and belonging.

- The meaning of her name, "beautiful" or "pretty," reflects her passion for beauty and fashion, which drives her dream of becoming a top fashion designer.

- The poem crafted from her name highlights the importance of her background in a small village, where her dreams were nurtured and her character was shaped.

- It also emphasizes the elegance and grace that her name represents, traits that she carries with her in her journey.

The exercise has demonstrated that by exploring the meaning and associations of a character's name, we can enrich their backstory and add depth to their personality. This, in turn, helps to create a more believable and engaging character, one that is intrinsically tied to the story they are a part of.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 23 Celebrating the name

Participants: All groups (10–15 minutes)

This is a direct follow-up to Exercise 22. Simply miss out the very last stage – the writing of the poem about yourself.

1	In pairs, read over the notes you have made on your names. Talk about them for a few minutes, then swap them over.

2	Now go and sit away from your partner. (This is important, to ensure that no more conversation takes place.)

3	Drawing from what your partner has written, you are going to create a poem celebrating their name. It will be about five or six lines long, so you will be selecting from all the things written. Select those lines, images, turns of phrase, etc., which you feel gives a sense of the person – an essence of them. You may add some words if it helps, and you may place things in a different order; but always remember that you are using what your partner has given you, and that you are celebrating their name.

4	Give or read the poem to your partner, as a gift. Post it up around the room.

5	Which images ‘capture’ a person well?

Outcome

Exercises 22 and 23 touch on an aspect of ‘character-creating’ that I     will deal with later on: the capturing of the essence of a character. By boiling-down the material  to  a  few  lines,  you  have  been  getting  to  the heart of what the person is like, of what makes them unique in your view.

The ‘name-poem’ is also an invaluable tool for developing creative interaction between individuals and groups. I first used it when working on a project which ‘twinned’ a primary class in the UK with another      in Singapore. The pupils worked at long-range, starting with the exchange of thoughts on their names and then the poems. This  created the basis for really creative dialogue between two very different groups. Used in a culturally mixed group, it is also an excellent tool for developing bridges of understanding and interest. (See Chapter 9 for details of this project.)

Even ‘not knowing’ about a name can be useful, as it offers a splendid context for research: genealogy, geography, history, etc.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, Exercise 23 can help to further explore and celebrate the characters in her life. By creating poems based on their names, we can uncover the essence of these characters, capturing their unique qualities and strengthening the connections between them.

For example, let's create a poem for Li Mei's best friend, Wu Yue:

Whispers of ink and brush,

Unfolding stories in strokes,

Yielding hues of life and love,

Eternal artist, fierce and free.

In this poem, we celebrate Wu Yue's character as a passionate artist who embraces life and love. By focusing on her name, we can create a vivid image of her and emphasize her importance in Li Mei's life.

Similarly, we can create a poem for Li Mei's father, Li Jilai:

Layers of tradition, wisdom bound,

Integrity standing tall and proud,

Journeys through time, roots run deep,

Imposing will, love beneath the leap.

In this poem, we emphasize Li Jilai's role as a strict father with strong traditional values, but also hint at his love for Li Mei.

By creating name-based poems for other characters, such as Chen Ying, Zhang Wei, Professor Liu, Huang Shan, and Liu Taibao, we can develop a deeper understanding of their essence and celebrate their roles in Li Mei's story. This exercise can also help to encourage empathy and understanding among diverse characters, fostering stronger connections and more dynamic relationships in the story.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example  in the context of Li Mei's story

FINDING THE STORY

Definition of ‘story’: ‘in the every day sense, any narrative or tale recount- ing a series of events’. A good test of good story is to see if it can be ‘boiled down’ to the essence of what it recounts. Some examples:

●	Romeo and Juliet: Two young people from warring families fall in love, everything is against them, their attempts to make it right fail, they die and everyone feels responsible and resolve to make peace.

●	Little Red Riding Hood: A young girl strays off the path, against her mother’s advice, meets a wolf, gets her grandmother eaten by the wolf and is rescued in the end.

●	An episode of Eastenders: The barmaid falls in love with her husband’s brother and there are fisticuffs in the pub. She decides she loves her husband best.

These examples are stories that take place in highly fictional worlds, –     I include television soap operas such as Eastenders and Coronation Street, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, in researching the ques- tion ‘what makes a story work?’, it is again useful to consider the world immediately around us. The reference to ‘the every day’ in the dictionary definition is useful, for in fact we tell stories all the time; it comes naturally to us: gossip, anecdote, ‘tall stories’ and downright lies, reminiscence, jokes, instructions, etc. Think of all the phrases we use to describe and comment on our story-telling activities: ‘he’s spinning you a line’, ‘the whole truth and nothing but the truth’, ‘that’s a pack of lies’, ‘it’s the same old story’, ‘now just you listen to me’, etc.

The playwright Bertolt Brecht wrote a series of poems on the theatre and the telling of stories. In one of them (‘On Everyday Theatre’) he advises actors to remember that their story-telling art is based upon an activity that happens daily – gossip, telling tales, reporting incidents and accidents, telling jokes, lying, etc. – and that they should never forget that link with the real world, beyond the artificial one of the theatre. As writ- ers, it is useful to take on board Brecht’s advice: there are stories being told around us all the time and we have always that source of riches to draw from.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, "Finding the Story" is about identifying the essence of her narrative and understanding that stories, like the ones we tell in our daily lives, are grounded in real-world experiences. By recognizing the connections between everyday storytelling and Li Mei's journey, we can create a more engaging and relatable story.

For example, let's boil down Li Mei's story to its essence:

Li Mei, a girl from a small village in Hangzhou, China, dreams of becoming the top fashion designer in the city. Despite her strict father and the challenges she faces, including a rivalry with Huang Shan and the villainous intentions of Liu Taibao, she perseveres with the support of her friends, lover, and mentor.

Now, let's find an example of everyday storytelling that connects with Li Mei's story. Consider a conversation between two friends discussing Li Mei's journey:

Friend 1: "Did you hear about Li Mei? She's trying to become the top fashion designer in Hangzhou, even though she's from a small village!"

Friend 2: "Yeah, I heard her father is really strict. How is she managing to chase her dreams?"

Friend 1: "She has some great friends like Wu Yue and Chen Ying, and her mentor, Professor Liu, is helping her out too. But she has some serious obstacles to overcome, like her rivalry with Huang Shan and that corrupt official, Liu Taibao."

Friend 2: "Wow, it sounds like a real uphill battle for her. I hope she makes it!"

In this conversation, we see the essence of Li Mei's story being shared as gossip or anecdote, just as we do in our everyday lives. By understanding that storytelling is a natural part of human communication, we can draw inspiration from the world around us and make Li Mei's story more engaging, relatable, and impactful for the audience. This connection to real-world storytelling also helps to ground the narrative in authentic experiences, making it easier for readers to empathize with the characters and become invested in the story.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 24 Everyday stories

Participants: Individual (24 hours)

Keep a notebook with you for 24 hours. Jot down all the ways in which you hear (or tell) stories, or snatches of stories, over that period. Don’t

include stories from the TV, radio or the papers, just those you hear live, at home, work, school, on the bus, in the shop, etc.

assistant: As an AI language model, I am unable to physically follow or record events for a 24-hour period. However, I can help you create a hypothetical scenario in which Li Mei, or other characters in her story, might experience or share stories in their everyday lives. Here's an example:

1. Morning - Li Mei's father, Li Jilai, shares a story about his youth, when he worked hard to provide for his family, emphasizing the importance of discipline and perseverance to Li Mei.

2. At school - Li Mei overhears her classmates gossiping about a fellow student who is facing difficulties in their relationship, reflecting on how fortunate she is to have Zhang Wei's support.

3. Lunchtime - Wu Yue tells Li Mei about a funny incident she experienced while working on her latest art project, where she accidentally spilled paint all over herself.

4. Afternoon - Professor Liu shares a story with Li Mei about a talented student he once mentored, who struggled but eventually succeeded in achieving their dreams, offering her encouragement and inspiration.

5. Evening - While shopping, Li Mei hears two customers discussing Huang Shan's qipao store and how they found the designs dull and uninspired, giving Li Mei a sense of confidence in her own designs.

6. Nighttime - At home, Chen Ying recounts a touching story of how her husband surprised her with a romantic dinner after a long day, highlighting the importance of love and support in relationships.

Throughout the day, Li Mei encounters various stories shared by the people around her, offering her insights, motivation, and a deeper understanding of her friends and community. By observing these everyday interactions, we can further develop and enrich the characters and their experiences in Li Mei's story.

Exercise 25 Instant stories

Participants: All groups, individual (30 seconds each)

1	Write down these three things: daffodil, cat, kitchen.

2	Write a sentence that links all three things into a very short story, keeping them in the same order. Make the story active. Begin with the words ‘Yesterday . . . ’. (See Example 25.1.)

3	Try these:

●	Banana, football, telephone.

●	Tree, pen, river.

●	Television, chicken, bed.

●	Computer, crocodile, toast.

●	Book, shoe, penguin.

4	Try different openings:

●	‘Today I would like to . . .’

●	‘I don’t understand why . . .’

●	‘The world would be a better place if . . .’. (See Examples 25.2.)

assistant: 1. Daffodil, cat, kitchen.

Yesterday, Li Mei picked a daffodil from her garden, only to find her cat playfully chasing it as she arranged flowers in the kitchen.

2. Banana, football, telephone.

Yesterday, Li Mei slipped on a banana peel while playing football with her friends, causing her to drop her telephone.

3. Tree, pen, river.

Yesterday, Li Mei climbed a tree to retrieve her pen, which had fallen into the branches, just as it was about to tumble into the river below.

4. Television, chicken, bed.

Yesterday, Li Mei watched a cooking show on television, inspiring her to make a delicious chicken dish before heading to bed.

5. Computer, crocodile, toast.

Yesterday, Li Mei designed a computer game featuring a crocodile who had to collect pieces of toast to win.

Now, let's try different openings:

1. "Today I would like to plant a daffodil, adopt a cat, and redecorate my kitchen."

2. "I don't understand why people eat bananas during football matches when they should be focusing on their phones."

3. "The world would be a better place if everyone took a moment to appreciate the beauty of trees, the power of pens, and the tranquility of rivers."

4. "Today I would like to learn a new recipe from a television show, cook a delicious chicken dinner, and then relax in bed."

5. "I don't understand why there isn't a computer game with a crocodile protagonist who loves eating toast."

6. "The world would be a better place if everyone took time to read a good book, put themselves in someone else's shoes, and protect the environment for penguins and other wildlife."

user: assess the outcome  in the context of Li Mei's story

Outcome

Writing creates meaning. By putting known words together in new ways, we create new meanings, new images, and new expressions. What do

computers, crocodiles and toast have to do with each other? This exercise has shown how, by linking together things that do not seem to belong together, we can create narratives that have not been heard before.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the exercise has demonstrated that seemingly unrelated elements can be combined to create unique and engaging narratives. By incorporating diverse elements like daffodils, cats, and kitchens, or even computers, crocodiles, and toast, we have expanded the story possibilities and generated new ideas for Li Mei's world. This exercise proves that the process of creating engaging narratives is not only about using familiar tropes or themes, but also about exploring unconventional combinations that can spark new directions for the story.

Moreover, this exercise has also allowed us to create small snapshots of Li Mei's daily life, giving the readers a glimpse into her world, her thoughts, and her experiences. This approach can help in developing Li Mei's character further, making her more relatable and genuine. In essence, this exercise has shown that combining unrelated elements can be an effective tool for building a rich and multidimensional narrative for Li Mei's story.

Exercise 26 What happens next?

Participants: All groups, individual (10–15 minutes)

All stories invite us to ask questions. The basic ‘What happens next?’ is as much at the heart of Oedipus Rex as it is for Little Red Riding Hood. The more complex the story, the more complex the  questions.  With  Little Red, we want to know if she’ll escape the jaws of the wolf. The plight      of  Oedipus  raises  huge,  possibly  unanswerable   questions   around our human inability, or refusal, to recognise the signs of the disasters awaiting us.

The best questions are often the ones that prompt other questions. The construction of a play can be regarded as the process of the writer setting themselves questions, then seeing what others they lead to.

1	Invent a character very quickly, using some of the methods in the earlier exercises. Jot down two or three things about the character: what they do, what characteristic they may have, what type of person they are. (See Example 26.1.)

2	Write down a question about the character. It can be a ‘big question’  or a ‘small question’. (See Examples 26.2.)

3	Write down three or four questions that are prompted by the first question. (See Examples 26.3.)

4	Don’t attempt to answer any of the questions. For each single question, find three or four more that are prompted by it. By the end you will have about twenty-or-so questions (big and small) about your character: who they are and what they are doing in life.

5	Select those questions that seem most useful in suggesting a story. Don’t even attempt to think about what the story might be. All you are doing is exploring the question ‘what happens next?’.

6	Try following each of these opening questions with five or six others:

●	Why is the student playing truant?

●	Where has the nurse hidden the  medicine?

●	Who does the elderly woman want to see?

●	What is the soldier bringing home from the war?

Exercise 27 The shape of the story

Participants: All groups, individual

All narratives have a shape, and we will be looking at this in detail in Chapter 8. Here is an exercise that explores one shape (a circular story). It may be used as a model for a group, or an individual, to create a succession of small, linked stories.

1	Sit in a circle. If you are working on your own, draw a large circle.

2	Around the circle are a number of characters in a story. We don’t  know anything about them.

3	Select an everyday object that has a number of uses. Make it an object that can be easily held in the hand. Discuss what the object can be used for (its primary use and secondary uses). (See Example 27.1.)

4	Write a list of all the different ways that an object may change hands. (See Examples 27.2.)

5	The object is going to travel clockwise around the circle, until it  returns to the starting point.

6	Each time the object changes hands, describe or write down (a) what it is being used for and/or (b) how it comes to change hands.    (See Examples 27.3.)

7	You have now completed the ‘journey of the object’. You have also discovered – through the things that happened around the object –  the beginning of some dramatic situations. Explore a few of those in brief note form. What strong dramatic episodes can you suggest? (See Example 27.4.)

8	Discuss or make notes on how each episode of the story could be  extended into a short scene.

assistant: 1. Sit in a circle or draw a large circle.

2. Around the circle are the characters in Li Mei's story: Li Mei, her strict father Li Jilai, her best friends Wu Yue and Chen Ying, her lover Zhang Wei, her mentor Professor Liu, her rival Huang Shan, and the villain Liu Taibao.

3. Select an everyday object: a beautiful silk scarf, which is an important prop in Li Mei's fashion design journey. It can be used as a fashion accessory, a gift, a symbol of love, or even as a tool for negotiation.

4. List different ways the scarf may change hands: as a present, as a token of appreciation, as a bargaining chip, or as an item being stolen or returned.

5. The silk scarf travels clockwise around the circle, changing hands as follows:

a. Li Mei creates the scarf, inspired by her love for Zhang Wei

b. Li Mei gifts the scarf to Wu Yue, who uses it as a creative inspiration for her art

c. Wu Yue passes the scarf to Chen Ying, who wears it as a symbol of friendship

d. Chen Ying gives the scarf to Zhang Wei, who uses it in a photography project featuring Li Mei's designs

e. Zhang Wei offers the scarf to Professor Liu, who recognizes Li Mei's talent and decides to mentor her

f. Professor Liu returns the scarf to Li Mei as a symbol of her progress

g. Li Mei uses the scarf in a fashion show, outshining her rival Huang Shan

h. Huang Shan tries to steal the scarf, but it ends up in the hands of Liu Taibao

i. Liu Taibao attempts to use the scarf as leverage over Li Mei, but she bravely refuses, and the scarf is eventually returned to her.

6. The journey of the scarf is complete, revealing dramatic situations and relationships between the characters.

7. Some strong dramatic episodes include:

- Li Mei's struggle to establish herself in the fashion industry

- Wu Yue's artistic inspiration from the scarf, leading to a collaboration with Li Mei

- The strengthening of Li Mei's friendship with Chen Ying and Wu Yue

- Zhang Wei's photography project featuring Li Mei's designs, garnering attention in the fashion world

- Professor Liu's mentorship of Li Mei and her growth as a designer

- The rivalry between Li Mei and Huang Shan intensifying at the fashion show

- Li Mei's confrontation with Liu Taibao and her refusal to give in to his demands

8. Each episode could be extended into a short scene, depicting the challenges, triumphs, and growth experienced by the characters as they navigate the world of fashion design, friendship, love, and self-discovery.

user: assess the outcome  in the context of Li Mei's story

Outcome

The process of writing is one of setting problems and attempting to solve them. We make narratives by asking questions. The deeper the questions, the more complex and satisfying the story will be for the audience.

assistant: Outcome:

In the context of Li Mei's story, the exercise has helped to reveal the connections and relationships between the characters, as well as the challenges and triumphs they face. The silk scarf served as a symbol and a tool, passing through the hands of each character and creating new narrative threads. By asking questions and delving deeper into the situations and relationships in the story, we have managed to create a more complex and satisfying narrative.

The exercise also highlights the importance of asking questions and setting problems to enhance the storyline. It encourages us to explore the characters' motivations, conflicts, and desires, which ultimately makes the story more engaging and relatable for the audience. The interconnectedness of the characters and the dramatic episodes in Li Mei's journey adds depth to the narrative and creates a more immersive and emotionally resonant experience for those who follow her story.

DIALOGUE

When we read a play, the first thing we are aware  of is the dialogue – and  the amount of it. ‘It’s the writing of the dialogue that really scares me’ is something I’ve often heard said; and of course, the notion of the blank sheet of paper (or screen) sitting there, waiting for ‘dialogue’ to land on it, is ter- rifying. Usually though, plays don’t happen like that and, as a general prin- ciple, situation, story and character all form themselves in the writer’s head before the dialogue emerges. Bits of speech, snatches of conversations, turns of phrase might emerge along the way, but fully formed scenes can only flow easily and naturally from a strong story based upon developed characters.

Even though dialogue often comes last, it is useful at the start of any process to have a sense of being able to write it. These exercises can be done on your own, or with a partner. As ever, don’t plan, just write.

Exercise 28 Alphabet-dialogue

Participants: All groups, individual (5–8 minutes)

1	At the top of the page, write out the alphabet.

2	You are going to write a dialogue between two people. You do not know who they are, where they are or what is happening.

3	Begin each sentence with a letter of the alphabet, starting with A and proceeding through to Z. (See Example 28.1.)

4	For Q, X and Z you can break the rule: if you can’t find a word beginning with the letter, it can appear somewhere in the word.

5	See what clues the A–Z dialogue gives and what questions it prompts: Who might the two characters be? What could their rela- tionship be? What things might happen in the story? What might the story be about? (See Example 28.2.)

assistant: 1. Alphabet-dialogue for Li Mei's story:

A: Are you going to the fashion event tonight?

B: But of course, I can't miss Li Mei's debut collection!

C: Can you believe she's come so far in such a short time?

D: Definitely, her talent and hard work are truly inspiring.

E: Everyone's talking about her unique designs.

F: Fashionistas across the city are raving about her modern take on traditional Chinese clothing.

G: Good for her, she deserves all the recognition she's getting.

H: Huang Shan must be feeling the pressure with Li Mei's rise to fame.

I: I heard they've been rivals since the beginning.

J: Just imagine how much more they could achieve if they worked together!

K: Knowing Huang Shan, she probably wouldn't want to share the spotlight.

L: Li Mei, on the other hand, seems more humble and open to collaboration.

M: Maybe they'll find a way to put their differences aside and join forces in the future.

N: Now that would be a fashion powerhouse!

O: Oh, I can't wait to see what they both have in store for us.

P: Perhaps we'll be surprised by their new collections.

Q: Quite possibly, the fashion world is always evolving, after all.

R: Remember when Li Mei first started, and nobody took her seriously?

S: She's certainly proved them wrong!

T: That's for sure, and with Professor Liu's guidance, she's only going to soar higher.

U: Unbelievable how much she's achieved despite the challenges she's faced.

V: Very true, especially with that corrupt official, Liu Taibao, trying to ruin her.

W: Well, she's a fighter, and nothing can bring her down.

X: Xactly, her determination is unstoppable.

Y: You know, I'm glad we're here to witness her journey.

Z: Zealously following her progress has been an amazing experience!

5. Clues and questions prompted by the A-Z dialogue:

- The two characters are discussing Li Mei's success in the fashion industry.

- They could be friends, colleagues, or fashion enthusiasts.

- Their relationship may be that of admirers or supporters of Li Mei's work.

- The story involves Li Mei's journey, rivalry with Huang Shan, and overcoming obstacles like Liu Taibao.

- Questions: How did Li Mei and Huang Shan become rivals? How has Professor Liu's mentorship impacted Li Mei's career? Will Li Mei and Huang Shan ever collaborate? How will Li Mei continue to navigate the challenges she faces in her career?

user: assess the outcome  in the context of Li Mei's story

Outcome

The ‘limitation’ of the alphabet-task serves a number of functions:

●	As a task-driven exercise, it removes any worries about ‘writing dia- logue’ by requiring the writer to focus on the task.

●	It gives a structure within which the dialogue has to operate. A–Z is, of course, a rudimentary structure; but – as we shall see – a scene in a play is something that leads to a definite outcome. However brief the scene, it will always have its ‘A’ and its ‘Z’ in terms of how it needs to start and when it needs to conclude.

●	It establishes the notion that the writing of dialogue is not about reproducing how people talk ‘in real life’. We may hear things that people do say in ‘real life’ and use them in our writing; but dialogue    in plays is artificially constructed. Writers draw upon modes of con- versational-exchange that exist, but no one speaks in exactly the way as the characters in a play by Oscar Wilde, a monologue by Samuel Beckett, or an episode of Eastenders. The cleverness of all of them – whether you like them or not – is that they ‘sound real’.

assistant: In the context of Li Mei's story, the alphabet-dialogue exercise successfully achieved its intended outcomes:

- The task-driven nature of the exercise helped focus on constructing dialogue instead of worrying about writing it perfectly. It encouraged creative use of language and sentence structure.

- The exercise provided a structure for the dialogue, making it easier to create a conversation between two characters. Although the A-Z structure is rudimentary, it serves as a reminder that each scene has a beginning and an end, and it's essential to work within that framework.

- The dialogue created during this exercise may not reflect real-life conversations, but it captures the essence of the characters' feelings and thoughts about Li Mei's journey. The exercise demonstrates that dialogue in plays or stories is an artificial construct that can still feel real and engaging to the audience.

Overall, the exercise contributed to Li Mei's story by generating a dialogue that sheds light on her achievements, her relationship with Huang Shan, and the challenges she has faced. This dialogue serves as an example of how to build conversations that sound genuine and resonate with the audience while staying true to the narrative.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Exercise 29 Place-association dialogue

Participants: All groups, individual (5–8 minutes)

1	Think of the city, town, etc., where you live.

2	Write down five locations, five colours and five things (animal, vegetable or mineral) you associate with the place. (You could make the list longer by adding other categories: feelings, abstracts, etc.) (See Example 29.1.)

3	Rewrite the list, in alphabetical order (first letters only). (See   Example 29.2.)

4	Write a dialogue in which the words occur in exactly that order. Once again, you do not know who the characters are when you start. See if the associations with the location begin to give a sense of who they might be, or what might be going on. (See Example 29.3.)

assistant: 1. Think of the city, Hangzhou, China, where Li Mei lives.

Exercise 31 Word-lists

Participants: All groups, individual (5–6 minutes)

We have already used lists of words as a channel for the imagination. Here they can be used to create a dialogue out of thin air.

1	Use this list of words: blue, fire, television, ice, car, green, love, rain, food, hand, mother, banana, history, song, war, home, red, newspa- per, hope, tree.

2	Write a dialogue for two people. You don’t know who they are or what the situation is. The words should occur in the dialogue in exactly the same order as they appear in the list. ‘Blue’ appears first, ‘fire’ comes next, etc. Once you have used a word, it can appear again at any point in the dialogue.

3	Don’t plan, just launch in with the first line and see where the words lead you.

assistant: 1. Use this list of words: blue, fire, television, ice, car, green, love, rain, food, hand, mother, banana, history, song, war, home, red, newspaper, hope, tree.

2. Write a dialogue for two people. You don’t know who they are or what the situation is. The words should occur in the dialogue in exactly the same order as they appear in the list.

Li Mei: This blue fabric would be perfect for my new design.

Zhang Wei: Yes, it reminds me of a fire, so vibrant and full of energy.

Li Mei: Did you see that fashion show on television last night?

Zhang Wei: No, I was busy getting some ice for my drink. My car's air conditioning isn't working.

Li Mei: I love this green silk, too. It would make a beautiful qipao.

Zhang Wei: Speaking of love, have you seen the rain outside? It's so romantic.

Li Mei: I could use some food right now, designing always makes me hungry.

Zhang Wei: Here, take my hand, let's go find something to eat.

Li Mei: My mother used to make the best banana pancakes.

Zhang Wei: That's a part of our family history I didn't know about.

Li Mei: You know, there's a song that always reminds me of our childhood.

Zhang Wei: Was it about war or peace?

Li Mei: It was about finding a home and a place where you belong.

Zhang Wei: That's beautiful. Look at that red dress in the newspaper! It's stunning.

Li Mei: It gives me hope that I can make it in the fashion world too.

Zhang Wei: I believe in you, Li Mei. Like that strong tree outside, you'll keep growing and thriving.

user: Please do this exercise in the context of Li Mei's story. Li Mei is a girl in Hangzhou, China. She comes from a small village but her dream is to be the top fashion designer in the city. She has a strict father whose name is Li Jilai. Her best friends are Wu Yue, an lesbian artist, and Chen Ying, a beautiful house wife. Her lover is Zhang Wei. Professor Liu is her mentor. Her rival is Huang Shan, who also operate a traditional qipao store. A villain is a corrupted official whose name is Liu Taibao, he is a womanizer who is greedy and lustful. Liu want to allure and force Li mei to be his mistress but Li Mei refuses. So Liu tries to revenge her.

Participants: All groups, individual (2–3 minutes)

1	You have two people. You don’t know who they are.

2	There will be ten lines of dialogue. You don’t know what they will be.

3	The first line will have ten words, the second nine words and so on, up to the tenth line, which will have one word.

Example 32.1

A: Have you got any bananas for sale today, mister Smith? (10)  B: Sorry, I don’t have bananas, but I’ve got apples. (9)

A: Those apples you sold last week were rotten. (8)  B: So are you calling me a cheat? (7)

...

Outcome

With the above exercises, we have established a principle that is at the heart of the development of all stories: even the most basic text contains within it the potential seeds for further development. When working with writers on their plays, I have found that the best way of moving forward is to address the clues that the text already provides. We all have a ten- dency to push aside an early thought or idea; to dismiss it as not very interesting. But an idea becomes interesting only if it is worked on, so it

is important is to keep digging away, right up to the point where we absolutely know it must be discarded. And even then, there might still be something that is useful. What we must do is to place value on the fact that anything we commit to the written word has value and potential.

assistant: 1. You have two people. You don’t know who they are.

2. There will be ten lines of dialogue. You don’t know what they will be.

3. The first line will have ten words, the second nine words and so on, up to the tenth line, which will have one word.

Li Mei: Have you seen the latest qipao designs, Wu Yue? (10)

Wu Yue: Yes, they're stunning, but I prefer your work. (9)

Li Mei: My father disapproves of my fashion career. (8)

Wu Yue: He will understand when you succeed. (7)

Li Mei: Zhang Wei always supports my dreams. (6)

Wu Yue: A great partner, indeed. (5)

Li Mei: Professor Liu is helpful. (4)

Wu Yue: Wise mentor. (3)

Li Mei: Huang Shan? (2)

Wu Yue: Rival. (1)

Outcome:

In this exercise, we have created a dialogue that progressively reduces the number of words in each line. It pushes the writer to convey meaning and character relationships more concisely, focusing on the essence of the interaction between the characters. This can be a useful technique for generating concise and impactful dialogue in a story, helping to keep the audience engaged and allowing for a faster pace. In the context of Li Mei's story, this exercise illustrates her relationships and the various characters who play a role in her journey, highlighting the importance of support, mentorship, and competition in her pursuit of becoming a top fashion designer.

Character Creation Activity.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Part two – inside–outside

Participants: Primary (3–6 minutes)

1	Draw a large outline of a person. This is now a character you are making up.

2	Using the list of ‘inside things’, write down what thoughts the person has, and what makes the person have different feelings.

Example 16.4

●	She is interested in how big the universe is.

●	She feels sad when she has to say goodbye to a friend.

●	She thinks longer holidays are a good idea.

●	She hates being told to go to bed.

assistant: Part two – inside–outside is an activity designed to help participants create a character by focusing on their internal thoughts, feelings, and emotions. This activity is particularly useful for creative writing exercises or group activities aimed at building empathy and understanding the perspective of others. It can be carried out by individuals or in groups, and it typically lasts for 3-6 minutes. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the activity, along with an example:

Step 1: Draw a large outline of a person.

To begin, draw a large outline of a person on a piece of paper or a whiteboard. This character will be the focus of the activity, and you will be making up their internal thoughts, feelings, and emotions.

Step 2: Using the list of 'inside things', write down what thoughts the person has, and what makes the person have different feelings.

Now, refer to a list of 'inside things' (i.e., emotions, thoughts, and feelings) and use this as a guide to explore the character's internal world. Write down what the person is thinking and what triggers their various emotions.

Example 16.4:

Here's an example of how you might apply this activity to create a character:

● She is interested in how big the universe is.

This statement indicates that the character has a curious nature and enjoys pondering big questions about the cosmos.

● She feels sad when she has to say goodbye to a friend.

This reveals that the character values her friendships and experiences sadness when parting with her friends, showing her emotional side.

● She thinks longer holidays are a good idea.

This thought suggests that the character appreciates leisure time and possibly values work-life balance.

● She hates being told to go to bed.

This statement indicates that the character dislikes being controlled or told what to do, potentially pointing towards a strong-willed or independent personality.

In this activity, the primary focus is on developing a deeper understanding of the character's internal world by exploring their thoughts, emotions, and reactions to various situations. As a result, participants can use this activity to create more complex and authentic characters in their writing or to build empathy and understanding towards others in group settings.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

The ‘outside’ things give one description of the person, but the ‘inside things’ tell us much more about what a person might be like. When we are making characters for a story or a play, we need to imagine them from the outside; but it is even more important to imagine them from the inside.

assistant: The 'inside' and 'outside' aspects of a character are crucial components of creating a well-rounded and relatable character for a story or a play. The 'outside' things refer to a character's physical appearance, behavior, and actions, while the 'inside' things relate to a character's thoughts, emotions, and motivations. Understanding both aspects helps in creating a character that feels more real and allows readers or audience members to connect with them on a deeper level.

Outcome:

Focusing on both the 'outside' and 'inside' aspects of a character gives a more comprehensive understanding of who the character is. While the 'outside' things describe the surface-level details, the 'inside' things provide insight into the character's deeper personality traits, feelings, and thought processes. This combination is essential for creating compelling and believable characters in stories or plays.

Example:

Let's consider a character named Sarah for a story. We'll start by describing her from the 'outside':

- Sarah has short brown hair and green eyes.

- She is tall and athletic.

- She often wears casual clothes like jeans and T-shirts.

- She is a high school teacher.

Now, let's explore Sarah's 'inside' things to better understand her personality:

- Sarah is passionate about helping her students succeed.

- She struggles with anxiety and often overthinks situations.

- She values her close relationships with her friends and family.

- She feels frustrated when she can't solve a problem and has a strong drive to find solutions.

By considering both the 'outside' and 'inside' aspects of Sarah's character, we have created a more detailed and nuanced portrayal of her. The 'outside' description helps us visualize Sarah and understand her role in the story, while the 'inside' things give us insight into her motivations, emotions, and deeper personality traits. This combination makes Sarah a more compelling and believable character, allowing readers or audience members to connect with her and become more invested in her story.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Exercise 17 Action, feeling and thought

Participants: Primary (1 minute per story)

1	Having completed Exercise 16, go back to the hand in Exercise 15.

2	You have the original five things your hand did. The task now is to put a feeling to each of the five actions. (See Examples 17.1.)

3	You now have five very short stories, all containing an action and a feeling.

4	Now try and put a thought into the story as well. (See Examples 17.2.)

5	You now have five short stories, each including an action, a feeling and a thought.

Examples 17.1

●	Today my hand pulled my sister’s hair and I felt guilty.

●	Today my hand stroked my cat and I felt calm.

Examples 17.2

●	Today I decided to hurt my sister, so I pulled her hair, then I felt guilty.

●	Today my hand stroked my cat. I felt calm and I wondered what the cat was thinking.

assistant: Exercise 17, titled "Action, feeling, and thought," is an activity designed to help participants practice creating short stories by combining actions, feelings, and thoughts. This exercise can be used to develop creative writing skills and encourage participants to explore the interplay between these elements in a story. It is suitable for primary-aged participants and can be completed in 1 minute per story. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise, along with examples:

Step 1: Refer to Exercise 15.

Having completed Exercise 16, go back to the hand in Exercise 15, where you have already noted five things your hand did.

Step 2: Add a feeling to each action.

For each of the five actions, assign a feeling or emotion associated with that action. This will help create a connection between the action and the emotional response.

Examples 17.1:

● Today my hand pulled my sister's hair and I felt guilty.

● Today my hand stroked my cat and I felt calm.

Step 3: Create short stories with action and feeling.

With the combination of an action and a feeling, you now have five very short stories, each containing these two elements.

Step 4: Add a thought to each story.

Now, add a thought to each story, providing an insight into the character's mind and revealing their perspective or motivation.

Examples 17.2:

● Today I decided to hurt my sister, so I pulled her hair, then I felt guilty.

● Today my hand stroked my cat. I felt calm and I wondered what the cat was thinking.

Step 5: Complete short stories with action, feeling, and thought.

You now have five short stories, each containing an action, a feeling, and a thought. These stories demonstrate how combining these elements can create more engaging and emotionally resonant narratives.

By practicing this exercise, participants can hone their creative writing skills and learn to incorporate actions, feelings, and thoughts into their stories effectively. The inclusion of these elements helps create more dynamic and relatable stories, allowing readers to connect with the characters and their experiences.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

●	Exercises 15–17 all show that, in the creating of a character for a story, we need to know what is done (the hair was pulled), why it was done (the decision to hurt someone) and the result (the feeling of guilt).

●	Interesting stories do not have to be copies of others you know. They can also start from things you know about, and develop on from there.

●	Basic as these exercises are, they introduce to the very young the notion that stories – which come naturally to them anyway – can be developed and made even more interesting through working at them.

●	The investigation of what goes on ‘inside’ is an invaluable way of extending the literacy of emotion, feeling and thought.

●	The exercises open the door to a discussion about the consequences of actions, and the responsibility for our own feelings.

assistant: Outcome:

Exercises 15-17 demonstrate essential aspects of character creation and storytelling, emphasizing the importance of understanding actions, motivations, and emotional consequences. These exercises can help young participants develop their creative writing skills and foster a deeper understanding of emotions, feelings, and thoughts.

1. Importance of actions, motivations, and emotional consequences:

The exercises show that creating a character for a story requires understanding what is done (e.g., the hair was pulled), why it was done (e.g., the decision to hurt someone), and the result (e.g., the feeling of guilt). This knowledge helps create well-rounded and believable characters, enabling readers to connect with their experiences.

Example:

In the short story example from Exercise 17.2, "Today I decided to hurt my sister, so I pulled her hair, then I felt guilty," the action (pulling hair), motivation (decision to hurt), and emotion (guilt) work together to create a compelling narrative.

2. Creating original stories:

Interesting stories do not have to be copies of others. Participants can draw inspiration from their own experiences and observations, developing unique narratives that resonate with their personal lives.

3. Developing storytelling skills:

These exercises introduce young participants to the concept of developing and enhancing their stories through practice and effort. They learn that stories can be made more interesting and engaging by focusing on the elements of action, feeling, and thought.

4. Exploring the 'inside':

Investigating the 'inside' aspects of characters - their emotions, feelings, and thoughts - is an invaluable way to extend young participants' literacy of these elements. By exploring the internal world of their characters, participants can create more complex and emotionally resonant stories.

5. Discussing consequences and responsibility:

These exercises open the door to discussing the consequences of actions and the responsibility we have for our own feelings. By examining the results of a character's actions and their emotional reactions, participants can develop a deeper understanding of personal responsibility and empathy.

In summary, Exercises 15-17 highlight the importance of understanding and incorporating actions, motivations, and emotional consequences in storytelling. These exercises help young participants develop their creative writing skills, explore their emotional literacy, and encourage discussions about responsibility and consequences.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Exercise 18 Interviews

Participants: All groups (8–12 minutes)

As with many of the other early-stage exercises, the investigation into the question of how ‘characters are built’ can be helped by looking at our immediate surroundings; in this case, the people we are with.

1	Write a short list of questions you might ask someone if you were conducting an interview for a magazine: likes, dislikes, greatest fears, happiest moment, opinions on world events, etc.; questions you consider would give a wider public a thumbnail sketch of that person.

2	Work in pairs. Interview your partners (2–3 minutes each). Try not to get into general conversation.

3	If you find your interviewee is digressing into unhelpful anecdote, you may lead on to the next question.

4	Write down the answers in note form.

5	Write a 100-word paragraph on your partner, based upon your notes. Try and make it flow, as a magazine article would. You can rearrange things to fit the style of the article.

6	Rewrite the article, inserting a couple of facts or pieces of information that are fictional. Make them believable in terms of the person you are describing, but see if they can have a hint of drama, mystery, etc.

7	Read out the results. What fictional information seemed totally out of place with the general character being described? What fictional information was cleverly placed, as to seem totally in keeping with the person being described?

assistant: Exercise 18, titled "Interviews," is an activity designed to help participants explore character creation by interviewing real people and incorporating fictional elements. This exercise is suitable for all age groups and typically lasts for 8-12 minutes. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise, along with an example:

Step 1: Write interview questions.

Write a short list of questions you would ask someone if you were conducting an interview for a magazine. These questions should cover likes, dislikes, greatest fears, happiest moments, opinions on world events, etc., to provide a comprehensive sketch of the person.

Step 2: Work in pairs and conduct interviews.

Pair up with a partner and interview each other, spending 2-3 minutes on each person. Stick to the interview format and avoid getting into general conversation.

Step 3: Stay focused and lead the conversation.

If your interviewee starts to digress into an unhelpful anecdote, gently guide them back on track by asking the next question.

Step 4: Take notes.

Write down your partner's answers in note form to use as a basis for your magazine article.

Step 5: Write a 100-word paragraph.

Using your notes, write a 100-word paragraph about your partner as if it were a magazine article. Make sure the paragraph flows naturally and rearranges the information to fit the article's style.

Step 6: Add fictional elements.

Rewrite the article, inserting two fictional facts or pieces of information that are believable in terms of the person you are describing. These fictional elements should have a hint of drama, mystery, or intrigue.

Step 7: Share and discuss results.

Read out the final versions of your articles and discuss which fictional information seemed out of place and which information was cleverly integrated into the character description.

Example:

Interview Questions:

1. What is your favorite hobby?

2. What is your greatest fear?

3. What was your happiest moment?

4. What is your opinion on climate change?

Interview Notes:

1. Loves photography

2. Fear of heights

3. Happiest moment: Graduation day

4. Climate change is a pressing issue

Original 100-word paragraph:

Jane is an avid photography enthusiast who spends her weekends capturing the beauty of nature. Her greatest fear is heights, which has prevented her from exploring certain breathtaking viewpoints. Jane's happiest moment was her graduation day, marking the culmination of years of hard work. She believes that climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action to preserve our planet for future generations.

Rewritten paragraph with fictional elements:

Jane is an avid photography enthusiast who spends her weekends capturing the beauty of nature, even venturing into abandoned buildings for the perfect shot. Her greatest fear is heights, yet she once faced this fear to save a kitten stuck in a tree. Jane's happiest moment was her graduation day, marking the culmination of years of hard work. She believes that climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action, and she actively participates in local environmental initiatives to preserve our planet for future generations.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

This exercise can lead to a discussion about an essential element in the build- ing of a character: whatever we invest the character with, it has to be credi- ble. This does not mean to say that the quiet man down the road cannot turn out to be a mass-murderer; but only if we can say ‘of course . . . that makes sense of everything we know about him’ when we discover the awful truth.

assistant: Outcome:

The primary goal of Exercise 18 is to help participants understand the importance of credibility in character creation. A well-crafted character should have traits and actions that align with their overall personality and background, even when fictional elements are introduced. Characters that are believable and consistent make for more compelling and engaging narratives.

Example:

Let's take the example of a quiet man named Mr. Smith who lives down the road. Mr. Smith is a loner, has few friends, and rarely interacts with his neighbors. He's always been polite but distant. One day, it's revealed that Mr. Smith is a mass-murderer.

The twist in the story could be considered credible if certain subtle signs or behaviors had been shown previously that would make this revelation make sense. For instance, perhaps Mr. Smith had an unusual interest in true crime stories, or there were strange occurrences at his house late at night. When the truth about Mr. Smith's dark secret is revealed, readers should be able to look back at these subtle hints and say, "Of course... that makes sense of everything we know about him."

In conclusion, Exercise 18 demonstrates the importance of credibility in character creation. By conducting interviews and incorporating fictional elements, participants learn to create believable characters while maintaining consistency and coherence in their narratives. This exercise emphasizes the need for characters to have traits, actions, and backgrounds that align with their overall personality, making the story more engaging and immersive for readers.

Exercise 19 Name and character Part one

Participants: Primary

You are going to create a character for a story. The character is not like anyone you know. You are going to start by finding a name for them. The name might be one you have heard before, or it might be one that has never been heard before.

1	Write down your own name.

2	Write out the letters of your name on separate small squares of paper.

3	Rearrange any of the letters to make new names.

4	Write out the list of new names.

5	Choose one of the names for the character you are going to write about. It can often be more interesting to choose a name that has never been heard of before. (See Examples 19.1.)

6	Find more about the character by using Exercises 16–18.

Examples 19.1

●	Noel: Leo, Leon, Len, Eno, Lon, etc.

●	Charlotte: Lotte, Carl, Cloe, Chloe, Atto, Tote, etc.

assistant: Exercise 19, titled "Name and character Part one," is an activity designed for primary-aged participants to create a unique character for a story by starting with a name. The name can be one they've heard before or an entirely new one. This exercise encourages creativity and helps participants explore the process of character creation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise, along with an example:

Step 1: Write down your own name.

Begin by writing down your own name. This will serve as the starting point for creating the new character's name.

Step 2: Create separate letter squares.

Write out the letters of your name on separate small squares of paper, so you can rearrange them easily.

Step 3: Rearrange the letters to form new names.

Using the separate letter squares, rearrange any of the letters to create new names. This process can lead to the creation of unique names that you may not have thought of otherwise.

Step 4: Write out the list of new names.

Compile a list of all the new names you've created by rearranging the letters of your own name.

Step 5: Choose a name for your character.

From the list of new names, choose one to use for the character you're going to write about. It can often be more interesting to select a name that has never been heard before.

Example 19.1:

● Noel: Leo, Leon, Len, Eno, Lon, etc.

● Charlotte: Lotte, Carl, Cloe, Chloe, Atto, Tote, etc.

Step 6: Learn more about the character using Exercises 16-18.

Now that you have a name for your character, use the methods taught in Exercises 16-18 to further develop the character's personality, background, emotions, and motivations.

In summary, Exercise 19 is a creative way for primary-aged participants to develop a unique character for a story by starting with a name. By rearranging the letters of their own name, they can create new and interesting names for their characters. This exercise helps participants engage with the character creation process and encourages them to think outside the box when developing characters for their stories.

user: please redo exercise 19 with chinese names in chinese characters e.g. 陶哲轩

assistant: Exercise 19, titled "Name and character Part one," can also be adapted for Chinese names using Chinese characters. The process remains the same, but participants will rearrange Chinese characters instead of English letters to create a unique name for their character. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise with a Chinese name example:

Step 1: Write down your own name.

Begin by writing down your own name in Chinese characters. This will serve as the starting point for creating the new character's name.

Example: 陶哲轩

Step 2: Create separate character squares.

Write out the characters of your name on separate small squares of paper, so you can rearrange them easily.

Step 3: Rearrange the characters to form new names.

Using the separate character squares, rearrange any of the characters to create new names. This process can lead to the creation of unique names that you may not have thought of otherwise. Keep in mind that when rearranging Chinese characters, you need to make sure the new combinations still make sense and are appropriate as names.

Example (based on 陶哲轩):

● 轩哲陶

● 哲陶轩

● 轩陶哲

Step 4: Write out the list of new names.

Compile a list of all the new names you've created by rearranging the characters of your own name.

Step 5: Choose a name for your character.

From the list of new names, choose one to use for the character you're going to write about.

Step 6: Learn more about the character using Exercises 16-18.

Now that you have a name for your character, use the methods taught in Exercises 16-18 to further develop the character's personality, background, emotions, and motivations.

In summary, Exercise 19 can be adapted for Chinese names using Chinese characters, providing a creative way for participants to develop unique characters for their stories. By rearranging the characters of their own name, they can create new and interesting names for their characters. This exercise helps participants engage with the character creation process and encourages them to think outside the box when developing characters for their stories.

Part two – name and character

Participants: Primary

You can use the character’s name to discover more about them.

1	Write your own name in a column down the side of the paper.

2	Write a list of things you like, beginning with each letter of the name. (See Example 19.2.)

3	Write a list of things you don’t like, again beginning with each letter of the name. (See Example 19.3.)

4	Repeat the exercise, using one of the new names you made from your own name.

5	If you are working in a group, discuss all the new characters. What clues as to who they might be are given by the ‘likes’ and ‘don’t likes’?

Example 19.2

Things I like.

●	N: Newspapers.

●	O: Oranges.

●	E: Elephants.

●	L: Lightning.

Example 19.3

Things I don’t like.

●	N: Nightmares.

●	O: Oil-spills.

●	E: Envy.

●	L: Ladders.

assistant: Part two of "Name and character" is an exercise for primary-aged participants that helps them explore and develop their character further by associating likes and dislikes with the letters of the character's name. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise along with an example:

Step 1: Write your own name in a column.

Begin by writing your own name in a column down the side of the paper.

Step 2: List things you like with each letter of the name.

Next to each letter of your name, write a list of things you like, starting with the corresponding letter. See Example 19.2 for reference.

Example 19.2:

Things I like.

● N: Newspapers.

● O: Oranges.

● E: Elephants.

● L: Lightning.

Step 3: List things you don't like with each letter of the name.

Similarly, next to each letter of your name, write a list of things you don't like, starting with the corresponding letter. See Example 19.3 for reference.

Example 19.3:

Things I don't like.

● N: Nightmares.

● O: Oil-spills.

● E: Envy.

● L: Ladders.

Step 4: Repeat the exercise using one of the new names.

Now, repeat the entire exercise (Steps 2 and 3) using one of the new names you created from your own name in the previous exercise (Part one of Name and character).

Step 5: Discuss the new characters in a group.

If you're working in a group, discuss all the new characters that have been created. Pay attention to the 'likes' and 'don't likes' associated with each character's name. These preferences can provide clues about the character's personality and help you understand more about who they might be.

In summary, Part two of "Name and character" is a creative exercise that helps primary-aged participants develop their character further by associating likes and dislikes with the letters of the character's name. By exploring these preferences, participants can gain insights into their character's personality and discuss how these preferences might define the character. This exercise encourages participants to think deeply about their characters, making their stories more engaging and relatable.

Exercise 20 Characteristics

Participants: All groups, individual (4 minutes)

Definition of ‘characteristic’: ‘a distinguishing quality, attribute or trait’; that is, moods, emotions, and ways of behaving that you associate with a person.

1	Write a list of single words you might use to describe qualities of character in a person. (See Examples 20.1.)

2	Look at the list. Find pairs of words that seem to contradict each other. Write thumbnail character sketches in which the person is described as having a range of characteristics. (See Examples 20.2.)

assistant: Exercise 20, titled "Characteristics," is an activity designed for all age groups to help participants explore and define various character traits. The goal of this exercise is to create thumbnail character sketches by pairing contradicting characteristics. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise along with an example:

Step 1: List single words to describe character qualities.

Write a list of single words you might use to describe the qualities of character in a person. These words should represent various moods, emotions, and ways of behaving that you associate with a person. See Examples 20.1 for reference.

Examples 20.1:

- Brave

- Timid

- Generous

- Selfish

- Curious

- Apathetic

- Patient

- Impatient

Step 2: Pair contradicting words and create character sketches.

Look at the list of words you've created. Identify pairs of words that seem to contradict each other, and then use these pairs to write thumbnail character sketches. In these sketches, describe the person as having a range of contradicting characteristics. See Examples 20.2 for reference.

Examples 20.2:

- Jane is a brave woman who isn't afraid to face her fears, yet she can also be surprisingly timid in social situations, preferring to stay in the background.

- Mark is known for his generosity and willingness to help others, but sometimes he can be quite selfish when it comes to sharing his time or possessions.

- Emily is a curious and inquisitive individual who loves to learn new things, but there are moments when she seems apathetic and disinterested, especially in topics that don't pique her interest.

In summary, Exercise 20 "Characteristics" encourages participants to explore various character traits and create thumbnail character sketches by pairing contradicting characteristics. This exercise helps participants understand the complexity of human emotions and behaviors and develop more realistic and relatable characters for their stories.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example. Outcome

A ‘daft’ person might be interesting in a story, as might a ‘wise’ person. But a person who is ‘daft but wise’ is going to be very interesting. Shakespeare’s clowns are often the wisest characters in the plays.

assistant: The outcome of Exercise 20, "Characteristics," highlights the importance of creating characters with complex and contradicting traits. Characters that possess a combination of seemingly opposing qualities can be more interesting and engaging in a story. This complexity adds depth and dimension to the characters, making them more realistic and relatable.

For example, a character who is "daft" (silly or foolish) might be interesting in a story, as their antics and behavior can provide comic relief. On the other hand, a "wise" character, who possesses knowledge and insight, can be interesting for their ability to guide and advise other characters.

However, a character who is both "daft but wise" can be even more compelling, as they present a unique blend of humor and wisdom. These characters may seem foolish at first glance but ultimately reveal unexpected insight and intelligence. This complexity makes them stand out and contributes to a more engaging story.

One example of this type of character is found in the works of Shakespeare. His clowns or fools often appear to be silly or nonsensical characters but are, in fact, some of the wisest and most insightful figures in the plays. They may use humor, riddles, or wordplay to convey important truths or observations about the other characters or the situations they face.

In summary, creating characters with a mix of contradicting traits, such as being "daft but wise," can lead to more interesting and captivating stories. These characters challenge readers' expectations and provide depth and nuance, making the stories more engaging and memorable.

Exercise 21 Type

Participants: All groups, individual (5 minutes)

Definition of ‘type’: ‘a person who typifies a particular quality’. This is slightly different from ‘characteristic’ in that it suggests that the quality identified is more central to the way the person is generally.

1	Write a list of popular or common phrases that are used to describe what type of person a character is. (See Examples 21.1.)

2	Using the ‘daft but wise’ examples in Exercise 20, create descriptions of characters that include (a) two ‘characteristic’ words and (b) ‘type’ phrases. (See Examples 21.2.)

3	Write a list of phrases that characters might use to describe them-  selves. (See Examples 21.3.)

Examples 21.1

●	She’s a natural born leader.

●	He’s a real creep.

●	She’s slippery as an eel.

●	That one’s a bit high-and-mighty.

●	She’s a real sport.

●	He’s a proper tyrant.

●	He’s always got his head in the clouds.

Examples 21.2

●	He’s daft but wise and he always gets his own way.

●	She may be bossy, but she’s helpful and she’s a real sport.

Examples 21.3

●	I never let life get me down.

●	I always tread carefully in life.

●	A born optimist, me.

●	I’m out for number one.

●	Whatever life sends my way, I take it on the chin.

assistant: Exercise 21, titled "Type," is designed for all age groups to help participants identify and explore different "types" of people in a story. This exercise focuses on using common phrases to describe the central qualities of a character, which is different from the "characteristics" exercise that focuses on individual traits. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the exercise along with examples:

Step 1: List common phrases to describe a person's type.

Write a list of popular or common phrases that are used to describe what type of person a character is. These phrases should convey a central quality or theme in the character's personality. See Examples 21.1 for reference.

Examples 21.1:

- She's a natural born leader.

- He's a real creep.

- She's slippery as an eel.

- That one's a bit high-and-mighty.

- She's a real sport.

- He's a proper tyrant.

- He's always got his head in the clouds.

Step 2: Create character descriptions using characteristic words and type phrases.

Using the "daft but wise" examples from Exercise 20, create descriptions of characters that include (a) two "characteristic" words and (b) "type" phrases. See Examples 21.2 for reference.

Examples 21.2:

- He's daft but wise and he always gets his own way.

- She may be bossy, but she's helpful and she's a real sport.

Step 3: List phrases characters might use to describe themselves.

Write a list of phrases that characters might use to describe themselves. These phrases should reflect the characters' own perspective on their personalities or ways of dealing with life. See Examples 21.3 for reference.

Examples 21.3:

- I never let life get me down.

- I always tread carefully in life.

- A born optimist, me.

- I'm out for number one.

- Whatever life sends my way, I take it on the chin.

In summary, Exercise 21 "Type" guides participants in identifying and exploring different "types" of characters using common phrases that describe their central qualities. This exercise helps participants develop a deeper understanding of characters and their defining attributes, enabling them to create more compelling and engaging stories.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

●	We have now begun to explore the possibility that a ‘character’ may have different sides to them, often contradictory ones. Their ‘type’ may be the dominant expression of how they are, but that may con- tain many other shades and variations.

●	In a play, people describe other people. They also describe them- selves. The two might be very contradictory. As we shall see in Chapter 4, what characters say about themselves may be very much at odds with what someone else says about them.

assistant: The outcome of Exercise 21, "Type," emphasizes the importance of recognizing that characters often have multiple sides or aspects to their personalities, which may be contradictory. By understanding a character's "type" as their dominant expression, we can explore the various shades and variations that exist within them, creating more complex and engaging characters for stories or plays.

For example, a character who is described as a "natural born leader" may generally exhibit leadership qualities and take charge in most situations. However, this character may also have a vulnerable side, struggling with self-doubt or insecurity in certain circumstances. These contrasting aspects make the character more relatable and interesting, adding depth to the story.

In plays, characters often describe other characters and themselves. These descriptions may be contradictory, providing differing perspectives on the same character. This can add layers of complexity and intrigue to a story, as it highlights the subjective nature of perception and understanding.

For instance, consider a character who describes themselves as a "born optimist." They may believe that they always see the bright side of things and approach life with positivity. However, another character may view them as naive or overly idealistic, leading to conflicting opinions on the same character. This contrast in perspectives can create tension and intrigue, making the story more engaging and thought-provoking.

In conclusion, Exercise 21, "Type," highlights the importance of exploring various aspects of a character's personality, including dominant expressions, shades, and variations. By considering both how characters describe themselves and how others perceive them, we can create complex, multi-dimensional characters that contribute to more captivating and engaging stories.

Exercise 22 What’s in a name?

Participants: All groups, individual (5–10 minutes)

You will eventually put a name to all the characters in your play or story. This is no light matter; no lighter than when your own parents or guardians gave you a name. We are very much defined by our names and they are centrally bound up with our self-identity and our personal history. It is no coincidence that when oppressors decide to eradicate the identities of those they oppress, one of the first things they often do is eradicate origi- nal names. The slave-owners in America gave their slaves westernised names; in 1930s Germany, all Jewish women had to register under the name of ‘Sarah’. How about all those true stories of people wanting to make a new life for themselves, and in doing so have changed their names?

All this may seem very far from the question of how to build a character for a fictional story, but an examination of our own names throws a great deal of light upon that matter, and this is what this exercise is based upon. A friend once sent me a birthday card with an African saying on it: ‘If you

can walk you can dance, if you can talk you can sing.’ I add a third thing: ‘If you can write your name you can tell a story.’

1	Write your name and the things you know and feel about it. (See Example 22.1.)

2	Take from your account of your name a few elements that feel key and use them to create a poem, reordering them in a manner that feels satisfying. In this way, you will have created a boiled-down essence of ‘you’. (See Example 22.2.)

assistant: Exercise 22, "What's in a name?", emphasizes the significance of names in defining an individual's identity, personal history, and self-perception. The exercise encourages you to examine your own name to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of naming characters in a story or play. It involves two steps:

1. Write your name and the things you know and feel about it. Consider any associations, memories, or feelings connected to your name. For example, you might consider its origin, meaning, or any nicknames you have been given.

Example 22.1:

Name: Emily

- Origin: Latin, meaning "industrious"

- Often called "Em" or "Emmy" by close friends and family

- Shared with a favorite childhood teacher, who inspired me to become a writer

- Sometimes felt too common, as there were always multiple Emilys in my classes

2. Select a few key elements from your account of your name and use them to create a poem. Rearrange and organize the elements in a way that feels satisfying to you, creating a condensed essence of your identity based on your name.

Example 22.2:

Industrious Emily,

Emmy, Em, a name so dear,

Shared with a teacher, inspiration clear.

Common yet unique,

A name that speaks.

In this exercise, you explore the connections between names and self-identity by reflecting on your own name and transforming it into a poetic representation of yourself. This understanding can then be applied to the process of creating and naming characters in stories or plays. By selecting meaningful names for your characters, you can add depth and nuance to their identities, making them more engaging and believable.

In conclusion, Exercise 22, "What's in a name?", highlights the importance of names in establishing character identities in stories and plays. By examining your own name and its associations, you gain insight into the power of naming and can apply this understanding when crafting fictional characters.

user: please analyze these two examples.

Example 22.1

Whenever I use this exercise, I always begin by using my own name as an example of what I mean when I say that ‘name’ and ‘character’ are very linked. Here is a rather full account; I generally do not use it in full, but draw from it as appropriate to the context I am working in.

●	My name is Noël Greig.

●	Noel is the French word for Christmas. In other languages it is Nowell (Old English), Manuel (Spanish), Emmanuel (Hebrew), Nollaig (Celtic), Manolis (Greek). They are all variants on ‘First Born’.

●	I was given my name because I was born on Christmas Day, 1944, the last year of the Second World War.

●	Famous names I share a birthday with: the film star Humphrey Bogart and Jesus Christ.

●	I didn’t like my name when I was young. No one else in the small town where I grew up shared it and it made me feel a bit exposed, particularly at Christmas when the school sang the carol ‘The First Noel’, which made me blush, which is why I still blush easily. The name Noel also sounded a bit like a girl’s name and – at that time in my life – it made me feel uncomfortable; even more so when, in ado- lescence, I came to realise I was gay. My name seemed a real give- away, at a time when to be gay was, to say the least, frowned upon.

●	On the other hand (and in complete contradiction to the above) I liked the name because it did make me feel ‘special’ (perhaps even with a bit of a ‘Jesus Christ complex’, in wanting to put the world to rights). The fact that there was a famous playwright, Noel Coward, with whom I shared my name, added to this feeling. Although when I discovered he was gay (before I’d come out) this became more problematic.

●	I’ve had various nicknames: Nollie, Noelie, Nelly. I like them all, because they remind me of the affection with which friends have used them.

●	My second name (my paternal name) derives from the Scottish clan MacGregor.

●	When the clan was outlawed for rising up against the English, the clan-name and the speaking of Gaelic was banned, and families chose variants of Greg, Gregg, Greig, etc. Many of them emigrated to other lands to escape English oppression. It may be that the Norwegian composer Edward Grieg may have had similar origins.

●	People are always spelling and pronouncing my name wrong (Grieg as in -eeg, not Greig as in -egg), which makes me very angry. I remem- ber one teacher at infant school who punished me for telling her that she had got my name wrong. To this day I still feel outraged by that incident.

Example 22.2

Here is an example of the list of thoughts and feelings turned into a poem, written by a nine-year old pupil in a class I worked with in a school in Nottingham.

I don’t know what my name means   I would like my name to mean great I think my name’s colour is blue

I think my name’s shape is square I think my name’s animal is dog My name comes from Vietnam My name is common in Vietnam

I quite like my name

I don’t know why I was named Minh

I think my name’s sound is the beat of a drum My name sounds like win

It also sounds like my mum’s name Lihn  I think my name’s food would be rice

assistant: Example 22.1 showcases a detailed account of a person's name, Noël Greig, and the feelings, memories, and associations related to it. This example demonstrates the connection between a name and a person's identity, history, and emotions. Some key aspects of this example include:

- The name Noël's etymology and variations in different languages, implying a sense of global connection

- The person's birthdate, shared with famous individuals, adds a unique aspect to their identity

- Feelings of exposure, discomfort, and uniqueness due to the rarity of the name in their hometown

- The influence of the famous playwright Noel Coward on the person's sense of self

- The affectionate nicknames, which reflect relationships with friends

- The history and struggles associated with their paternal name, Greig, connecting them to a broader cultural and historical context

Example 22.2 is a poem written by a nine-year-old student, which condenses their thoughts and feelings about their name, Minh. This poem demonstrates how a person can transform their perceptions of their name into a creative, poetic form. Key aspects of this example include:

- The curiosity about the meaning and origin of the name Minh, showing a desire to learn more about their identity

- Associations with colors, shapes, sounds, and animals, illustrating the sensory connections they have with their name

- The recognition of their Vietnamese heritage and the connection to their mother's name, Lihn

- The personal preferences and feelings about their name, which contribute to their self-image

These two examples emphasize the significance of names in shaping an individual's identity, personal history, and emotional connections. By examining their own names and associated feelings, both individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the importance of naming in character development for stories or plays.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

Simply by using our names as the controlling factor, we have revealed quite a lot about ourselves. Nine-year old Minh’s view on himself uses a lot of imagery, while mine was more autobiographical, but both include personal history, family history, ethnic origins, etc. The exercise reveals a huge amount about what we mean by ‘creating a character’: our fictional characters need to have as rich a history as our own lives have. Just as our own stories can be told through our names, so too should the stories of our fictional characters. We have seen how ‘character’ and ‘story’ are inextricably linked.

assistant: The outcome of the exercise highlights the importance of names in revealing aspects of personal history, emotions, and experiences. By using names as a starting point, both real and fictional characters can be imbued with rich histories and complex identities. The exercise demonstrates that characters should be as well-developed and multifaceted as real people, as this complexity contributes to a more engaging and believable story.

For example, consider a fictional character named Lila. In developing her character, a writer might explore:

- The origin and meaning of the name Lila, which could influence her personality or role in the story

- Lila's personal history, family background, and cultural context, which shape her worldview and motivations

- Lila's feelings and associations with her name, which might reveal her insecurities, desires, or unique traits

- The experiences, relationships, and events that have defined Lila's life, contributing to her growth and development

By examining Lila's name and its associated meanings, the writer can create a well-rounded character with a rich backstory. This depth and complexity will make Lila a more engaging character for readers or audience members, as they can relate to her as a fully-realized individual with a believable history.

In conclusion, the exercise demonstrates the close relationship between character development and storytelling. Creating fictional characters with a strong sense of identity, history, and emotion can greatly enhance the overall impact of a story, making it more immersive and relatable for readers or viewers.

Exercise 23 Celebrating the name

Participants: All groups (10–15 minutes)

This is a direct follow-up to Exercise 22. Simply miss out the very last stage – the writing of the poem about yourself.

1	In pairs, read over the notes you have made on your names. Talk about them for a few minutes, then swap them over.

2	Now go and sit away from your partner. (This is important, to ensure that no more conversation takes place.)

3	Drawing from what your partner has written, you are going to create a poem celebrating their name. It will be about five or six lines long, so you will be selecting from all the things written. Select those lines, images, turns of phrase, etc., which you feel gives a sense of the person – an essence of them. You may add some words if it helps, and you may place things in a different order; but always remember that you are using what your partner has given you, and that you are celebrating their name.

4	Give or read the poem to your partner, as a gift. Post it up around the room.

5	Which images ‘capture’ a person well?

assistant: Exercise 23, "Celebrating the name," is designed to help participants appreciate the power of names in character development and storytelling. By creating a poem based on their partner's name and personal details, participants can celebrate the unique qualities that define each individual. This exercise emphasizes the importance of deeply understanding a character and their background in order to create engaging stories.

For example, let's say that two participants, Alice and Ben, have partnered for this exercise. They've shared the information about their names and personal histories with each other. Alice learns that Ben's name means "son of the south" and that he loves traveling, enjoys playing soccer, and has a strong connection with his family.

Alice might create the following poem to celebrate Ben's name:

Son of the south, a traveler bold,

A heart of adventure, a spirit untold,

On the soccer field, his passion ignites,

Family ties, his guiding lights,

Ben, a name that sings of life's embrace.

In this poem, Alice captures the essence of Ben by incorporating the meaning of his name and the details of his life that he shared. She celebrates his love for travel, soccer, and family while acknowledging the significance of his name in shaping his identity.

The outcome of this exercise is that participants learn to appreciate the importance of names and personal histories in storytelling. By creating poems that celebrate their partner's name, they recognize the power of names in defining characters and making them more engaging and relatable to readers or audience members. This exercise also encourages empathy and understanding between participants, as they learn more about each other and reflect on their own identities.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Outcome

Exercises 22 and 23 touch on an aspect of ‘character-creating’ that I     will deal with later on: the capturing of the essence of a character. By boiling-down the material  to  a  few  lines,  you  have  been  getting  to  the heart of what the person is like, of what makes them unique in your view.

The ‘name-poem’ is also an invaluable tool for developing creative interaction between individuals and groups. I first used it when working on a project which ‘twinned’ a primary class in the UK with another      in Singapore. The pupils worked at long-range, starting with the exchange of thoughts on their names and then the poems. This  created the basis for really creative dialogue between two very different groups. Used in a culturally mixed group, it is also an excellent tool for developing bridges of understanding and interest. (See Chapter 9 for details of this project.)

Even ‘not knowing’ about a name can be useful, as it offers a splendid context for research: genealogy, geography, history, etc.

assistant: The outcome of Exercises 22 and 23 highlights the importance of capturing the essence of a character in storytelling. By condensing the character's background, name, and personal details into a few lines or a short poem, participants are able to reach the core of what makes that character unique and interesting. This process of distilling a character's essence can be applied to creating fictional characters in plays or stories, making them more relatable and engaging to audiences.

For example, let's say a writer wants to create a character named Lily who is passionate about environmental conservation, has a strong bond with her family, and is a talented painter. The writer could create a brief name-poem to capture the essence of Lily:

Lily, blooming in nature's care,

Champion of the earth, both bold and fair,

Family roots that ground her tight,

Painter's touch, a world in sight,

A spirit as vibrant as her name.

This poem captures the key aspects of Lily's character, giving the writer a clear understanding of her personality and the qualities that make her unique.

The name-poem exercise is also a valuable tool for fostering creative interaction and understanding between individuals and groups from different cultural backgrounds. By exchanging thoughts on their names and creating poems for each other, participants build bridges of understanding and interest. This exercise can be particularly effective in culturally diverse groups or projects involving collaboration between groups from different regions or countries.

Furthermore, when participants don't have much information about a name, it provides an opportunity for research and exploration of genealogy, geography, history, and other related topics. This process of learning and discovery can enrich character development and storytelling, as well as enhance the overall understanding of diverse backgrounds and cultures among the participants.

user: why name is so important for creating character in playwriting. analyse the name Olive in little miss sunshine.

assistant: In playwriting, names are essential for creating characters because they contribute to the characters' identity, background, and personality. A well-chosen name can help the audience understand and connect with the character, making the story more engaging and relatable. Names can convey cultural, historical, or symbolic meanings, which can further enhance the depth and complexity of a character.

In the case of "Little Miss Sunshine," the character Olive Hoover has a name that carries significance in the context of the story. Olive is a young girl who dreams of winning a beauty pageant. The name "Olive" has several connotations that can be analyzed in relation to her character:

1. Symbolism: An olive branch is a symbol of peace and reconciliation. Olive's character embodies these qualities as she brings her dysfunctional family together throughout their journey. She is the unifying force that helps her family members reconcile their differences and support each other.

2. Uniqueness: The name "Olive" is not a common name for a beauty pageant contestant, which highlights her distinctiveness compared to the other participants. This uniqueness mirrors Olive's personality, as she does not fit the conventional mold of a beauty queen but still pursues her dream with unwavering determination and optimism.

3. Color association: The color olive green is associated with nature, growth, and renewal. Olive's character represents growth and change within her family as they embark on a journey of self-discovery and acceptance. Her presence and pursuit of her dream act as a catalyst for her family members to reevaluate their priorities and grow as individuals.

In summary, the name "Olive" in "Little Miss Sunshine" holds symbolic, cultural, and contextual significance, which adds depth to her character and enhances the audience's understanding of her role in the story. A well-chosen name is crucial in playwriting as it can create a strong foundation for a character's development and impact on the story.

user: All in all how to create a memorable character according to these exercises.

assistant: These exercises offer various methods for creating memorable characters in playwriting or storytelling. To create a memorable character, consider the following steps:

1. Understand your character's background: Consider their personal history, cultural background, and upbringing. Understand their family connections, friendships, and other relationships that shape their identity.

2. Develop their personality traits: Identify their strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes, habits, and quirks. Use Exercise 20 (Characteristics) to explore a range of traits, including contradictory ones, to make the character more complex and interesting.

3. Determine their motivations and goals: What does the character want? What drives them to take action? What obstacles do they face in achieving their goals? Establishing clear motivations and objectives helps create a dynamic character with a strong presence in the story.

4. Give them a unique and meaningful name: A character's name can reveal a lot about their identity, background, and personality. Use exercises 19 (Name and Character) and 22 (What's in a Name?) to explore the significance of names and select one that resonates with your character's essence.

5. Create a distinct voice and appearance: Develop a unique way of speaking, body language, and physical appearance for your character. This helps to differentiate them from other characters and make them memorable.

6. Develop their character arc: Allow your character to grow and change throughout the story. This can involve learning valuable lessons, overcoming challenges, or experiencing transformative events. A character's arc makes them more engaging and relatable to the audience.

7. Use contrast and contradiction: Create characters with contrasting traits or who experience internal conflicts. This adds depth and complexity, making them more memorable and intriguing.

8. Show, don't tell: Reveal your character's personality, motivations, and emotions through their actions and dialogue, rather than simply describing them. This helps the audience connect with the character on a deeper level.

By following these steps and incorporating the exercises discussed earlier, you can create memorable characters that resonate with your audience and contribute to a compelling story.

assistant: Title: Crafting Unforgettable Characters: The Art of Breathing Life into Your Stories

[Opening]

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a TED talk that will take you on a journey through the world of storytelling, where unforgettable characters come to life and shape the tales we cherish. So, buckle up as we embark on an adventure to uncover the secrets of creating memorable characters with examples, humor, and yes, punchlines!

[The Importance of Characters]

You see, the heart of any great story lies in its characters. They are the ones who make us laugh, cry, and root for them as they struggle, triumph, and sometimes even fail. And let's not forget the villains, who we love to hate, but secretly admire for their cunning ways.

[Character Contradictions]

Now, when it comes to crafting a memorable character, we must embrace the power of contradictions. I mean, haven't you ever met someone who is both incredibly wise and yet, also inexplicably daft? It's like the Shakespearean fool who often turns out to be the wisest character in the play! So, next time you write a character, remember to surprise your audience by injecting a healthy dose of contradiction.

[A Name to Remember]

And what's in a name, you ask? Well, a lot actually! Take, for example, the character Olive from "Little Miss Sunshine." Her name evokes images of peace, warmth, and well, sunshine! It's a name that sticks with you and reflects her youthful innocence and determination. So, when naming your character, think about how the name represents their essence and adds depth to their persona.

[The Power of Backstory]

A character without a past is like a tree without roots - it's bound to topple over. To give your character depth and substance, explore their personal history, relationships, and experiences that have shaped who they are today. Think of Batman - without his tragic backstory, he's just a guy in a bat costume fighting crime. It's the pain of losing his parents that drives him to become a hero and protect others.

[Humorous Anecdote]

Now, speaking of costumes, let me share a funny story with you. I once attended a costume party dressed as a character I created - the "Reluctant Hero," complete with a cape and a mask that read, "I'd rather be at home." But, as the night went on, I realized that people were not only laughing at my costume but also connecting with it on a deeper level. You see, even in humor, we can create characters that resonate with our audience and leave a lasting impression.

[The Art of Showing]

A great character isn't just about what they say, but what they do. Actions speak louder than words, as they say. So instead of merely telling your audience how brave, kind, or clever your character is, let them show it through their actions and decisions. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words, right?

[Punchline]

In conclusion, remember that crafting memorable characters is a lot like making a good sandwich - you need a mix of interesting ingredients, a dash of spice, and a name that makes people say, "I've got to try that!" And, just like a sandwich, once you've tasted a great character, you'll never forget it.

Thank you for joining me on this journey through the world of character creation. May your stories be filled with unforgettable heroes, lovable rogues, and dastardly villains that leave your audience hungry for more!

assistant: The preface of Noel Greig's "Playwriting: A Practical Guide" serves as an introduction to the book's purpose and structure, outlining the author's approach to teaching playwriting and his emphasis on creating engaging and original plays. Greig's preface also sets the tone for the rest of the book, encouraging readers to approach the exercises and advice with an open mind and creative spirit.

To create a workbook based on the preface and the rest of the book, it is important to first understand the core elements that Greig emphasizes in his approach to playwriting. These include:

1. The importance of a strong, engaging story that connects with the audience.

2. The development of well-rounded, believable characters.

3. The use of effective dialogue and action to drive the story forward.

4. The necessity of conflict, tension, and stakes to create a compelling narrative.

5. The role of structure in shaping the play and guiding the audience through the story.

With these core elements in mind, the workbook should contain exercises and examples that help students develop their understanding and skills in each of these areas. Some example exercises and materials to include in the workbook could be:

1. Story brainstorming: Provide prompts and suggestions for students to create engaging story ideas, along with examples of successful plays and their storylines.

2. Character development: Include exercises that encourage students to explore their characters' backgrounds, motivations, and relationships, along with examples of well-crafted characters from various plays.

3. Dialogue and action: Offer exercises that help students practice writing natural-sounding dialogue and incorporating action to move the story forward, with examples from notable plays to demonstrate effective use of dialogue and action.

4. Conflict, tension, and stakes: Include exercises that focus on creating and maintaining conflict, tension, and stakes throughout the story, along with examples from plays that successfully build and resolve these elements.

5. Play structure: Offer explanations and exercises on different play structures, such as the three-act structure, along with examples of plays that utilize these structures effectively.

Additionally, the workbook can incorporate materials such as excerpts from famous plays, interviews with successful playwrights, and articles or essays on playwriting techniques to further enrich the learning experience. By combining these exercises, examples, and additional materials, the workbook will provide a comprehensive and engaging resource for students to effectively learn the art of playwriting.

To be part of an audience at a live drama is an opportunity to experience the critical or self-conscious dimension to our shared existence. Gathering together to witness a performance, we are celebrating our ability – our need – to reflect on the conditions that make (or unmake) us human. Private concerns are made public; the invisible is made visible. In the course of my working life as a theatre practitioner I have witnessed this deep-seated human need for the ritual that expresses our common human- ity in a wide range of contexts. The group-devised play in a school hall, the large-cast community pageant-play, political street theatre in India, dance- and-song drama in Africa, location-specific work performed in libraries, car-parks, on beaches and in abandoned buildings, professional and ama- teur performance, major world drama, experimental work and new plays in small studios and on main stages; I make no distinction between them in terms of their function. The little scene written and performed in the classroom may pass off in an afternoon and never be heard of again. The new play written by one author and presented on the stage of a national theatre may pass into the canon of great, universal works. But as events that bring us together and connect us with each other they are equal.

assistant: In this passage, Noel Greig emphasizes the importance and power of live drama as a medium for connecting people, exploring humanity, and making the invisible visible. He believes that all forms of drama, regardless of scale or context, serve the same essential purpose: to express our shared humanity and bring us together.

One example of how this can be seen is in the context of community theater. A small town might come together to put on a play that deals with local issues or experiences. The play could be written and performed by community members, some of whom may not have any formal acting or writing experience. Despite its humble origins, the play can have a profound impact on the community, sparking conversations, strengthening connections, and encouraging reflection on their shared experiences.

Let's consider a hypothetical example: A small coastal town has been struggling with the impact of pollution on their fishing industry. A group of local residents decides to create a play that explores the personal stories and challenges faced by the fishermen and their families. The play is performed in a local community center and attracts a modest audience of fellow residents.

In this scenario, the play serves as a platform for the community to come together and examine the issue of pollution and its consequences on their lives. By dramatizing the experiences of the fishermen and their families, the play makes the invisible struggles visible to the audience. The personal stories become a shared concern, prompting the community to discuss and potentially take action to address the pollution problem.

Greig argues that the impact of this community play is just as important and meaningful as a new play performed at a national theater that may enter the canon of great works. Both types of plays bring people together and encourage reflection on the human experience, fulfilling the essential function of live drama.

In summary, Greig highlights the unique power of live drama to connect people, explore our shared humanity, and make the invisible visible. Regardless of the scale or context, all forms of drama serve this essential purpose, making them equally important and valuable.

Who the book is for

This book is intended for all individuals and groups who are engaged with ‘the word’ as part of the development of live performance. The practical work it offers has been developed through my engagement with a wide range of communities and contexts: educational- and youth-theatre, com- munity groups (geographical- or interest-led), professional and amateur,

within the UK and internationally. All of it can be applied to the type of text being developed for the particular context and, almost without excep- tion, every exercise can be adapted to any context. An exercise that I have used with an individual writer in a South African township has worked equally well with a youth-theatre group in a UK city; one used in a pri- mary school can similarly adapt to a class with students on an MA playwriting course. I will give some guidance on the adaptation of exercises in Appendix A.

assistant: In this passage, Noel Greig explains that his book, "Playwriting: A Practical Guide," is designed for anyone involved in the creation of live performance through the use of written text. The book's practical exercises and techniques have been developed and tested in various settings, including educational and youth theater, community groups, professional and amateur theater, both in the UK and internationally.

The adaptability of the exercises in the book is one of its key strengths. Greig emphasizes that the exercises can be tailored to suit various contexts, making the book valuable for a wide range of individuals and groups. This adaptability is illustrated through the examples he provides.

Example: An exercise used with an individual writer in a South African township and a youth-theater group in a UK city.

In this example, Greig demonstrates that the same exercise can be effectively applied to two vastly different contexts: working with an individual writer in a South African township and with a youth-theater group in a UK city. This versatility showcases the book's ability to cater to different environments and audiences while still providing valuable guidance and techniques.

Another example mentioned by Greig is the adaptability of an exercise initially used in a primary school setting, which can be modified to suit a class with students on an MA playwriting course. This further reinforces the book's flexibility and its applicability to various levels of experience and expertise.

In Appendix A, Greig provides additional guidance on how to adapt the exercises for different contexts, ensuring that readers can tailor the content to their specific needs and circumstances.

In summary, "Playwriting: A Practical Guide" is intended for a diverse audience engaged in developing live performance through written text. The book's practical exercises have been tested in various settings and can be adapted to suit different contexts and skill levels, making it a valuable resource for individuals and groups involved in playwriting and theater.

How to use the book

The book is arranged into nine chapters. Chapter 1 offers a range of exercises that enable first-time writers to engage with basic elements of writing plays, or for groups to begin to create material collaboratively. Subsequent chap- ters look in detail at specific aspects of the craft: character-creation, play- structure, etc. Some of this work will have particular interest to the individual playwright or to creative-writing groups, but much of it also will be of use to the process of group-devising or collaboration. The final chapter gives some examples of models for large group-devised or collab- oratively written plays. Notes for facilitators and group leaders are included in Appendix B.

Each exercise is presented in a  step-by-step  manner,  with  examples and outcomes. I have indicated – where appropriate –  an  approximate time frame for exercises. I have  also  indicated  those  exercises  that  can be undertaken by an individual, as well  as  in  a  group.  A  few  exercises (15, 16, 17, 19, and 90) I have to date used only with  primary  class  children; but I would not wish this to mean that they might not have a      use in other contexts, nor that all the other work cannot be adapted to     this age group.

You may use the book in a variety of ways:

●	As a step-by-step guide to the construction of a whole narrative, both individually and group-written.

●	As a ‘dip-in’ resource for one-off workshops and courses.

●	As a source of models for large-scale performance projects.

assistant: In this passage, Noel Greig explains the structure of his book "Playwriting: A Practical Guide" and offers suggestions on how readers can use it effectively.

The book is divided into nine chapters, with each chapter focusing on a specific aspect of playwriting. Chapter 1 provides exercises for first-time writers and groups to engage with basic elements of playwriting, while subsequent chapters delve into more specific aspects, such as character creation and play structure. The final chapter offers examples of models for large group-devised or collaboratively written plays. Appendix B contains notes for facilitators and group leaders.

Each exercise is presented in a step-by-step manner, including examples and outcomes. Greig indicates approximate time frames for each exercise and notes whether they are suitable for individuals or groups. He also mentions that a few exercises (15, 16, 17, 19, and 90) have primarily been used with primary class children, but this does not limit their applicability to other contexts.

The book can be used in various ways:

1. As a step-by-step guide for constructing a whole narrative: Readers can follow the book in sequence, using it as a guide to help them create a complete narrative, either individually or as part of a group.

Example: A group of amateur playwrights could use the book as a structured guide to develop their first play, following the exercises in each chapter sequentially to build their story, characters, and structure.

2. As a 'dip-in' resource for one-off workshops and courses: Readers can use the book as a reference during workshops or courses, selecting specific exercises or chapters to focus on particular aspects of playwriting.

Example: A theater instructor might choose a character-creation exercise from the book to use in a single session of their playwriting workshop, allowing participants to hone their skills in this specific area.

3. As a source of models for large-scale performance projects: The book provides examples and models that can be used for developing large-scale, group-devised, or collaboratively written plays.

Example: A community theater group planning a large-scale production could use the models provided in the book to guide their collaborative playwriting process, ensuring that the final work is cohesive and well-structured.

In summary, "Playwriting: A Practical Guide" is a versatile resource that can be used in multiple ways, depending on the reader's needs and goals. Whether as a step-by-step guide, a resource for workshops, or a source of models for large-scale projects, the book offers valuable insights and exercises for playwriting enthusiasts and professionals alike.

1	Getting going and warming up

Actors begin rehearsals with a physical and vocal warm-up. This helps them to clear the body and the mind of daily distractions and tensions, focus them on the space they are in and prepare them for the task in hand. Writers also need strategies to clear themselves of the clutter and access the open channel between the mind, the hand and the sheet of paper (or the screen). This might include some sort of physical activity; a friend of mine, who writes at home but needs to separate her work from the washing-up, does the morn- ing domestic routine, then goes out for a walk and eventually ‘walks to work’. If I am working with a group, I will generally start with some sort of physi- cal activity or game. Even then, the blank page (or screen) can still be sitting there, waiting for the words that refuse to come, and some form of kick-start writing activity can be useful. What follows are a range of exercises designed to stimulate the ‘writing-muscle’. The first few are general ‘warm-up’ exer- cises. I will then move on to ‘introductory’ exercises for work that will be dealt with in greater detail in the following chapters. The chapter may be used in a range of ways according to your needs, for example:

●	As a template for an introductory course in playwrighting.

●	As a menu from which to construct a one-off workshop.

●	As a stimulus for a group-devising process.

●	As a range of ‘getting-going’ exercises for when you have come back from your morning walk.

MEMORY

Writing is, as much as anything, an act of memory. Not necessarily as a recording of your own life and history, but rather as an attempt to capture  in words impressions made on the senses by the world around us. What

did that type of rain feel like? What was that woman’s unusual way of expressing herself ? What made the journey to work or school today different from any other of those journeys?

assistant: In this section, Noel Greig discusses the importance of warming up before engaging in the writing process. Just as actors warm up physically and vocally before rehearsals, writers need strategies to clear their minds and prepare for writing. Greig suggests that physical activity can be helpful for writers to separate their daily routines from their creative work.

One example he provides is a friend who "walks to work" after finishing her morning domestic routine, using the walk as a way to transition from daily tasks to her writing. This physical activity helps her mentally prepare for the writing process.

Greig offers various warm-up exercises to stimulate the "writing muscle" and help writers overcome the challenge of facing a blank page or screen. These exercises are designed as introductory activities that can be used in different ways, such as:

1. As a template for an introductory course in playwriting.

2. As a menu for constructing a one-off workshop.

3. As a stimulus for a group-devising process.

4. As a range of 'getting-going' exercises for individual writers.

He emphasizes the role of memory in writing. Writing is not just about recording one's life and history, but also about capturing the impressions made by the world around us through our senses. This can include the feeling of a specific type of rain, a unique way someone expressed themselves, or what made a particular journey to work or school different from others.

Example: A playwriting instructor could use the MEMORY exercise in a workshop, asking participants to write a short scene based on a vivid sensory memory they have experienced. This exercise helps writers access their memories as a source of inspiration and develop their skills in capturing sensory impressions in their writing.

In summary, warming up is an essential part of the writing process, as it helps clear the mind and prepare the writer for the task at hand. Noel Greig offers various warm-up exercises in this chapter to help writers and groups get started, with a focus on using memory as a powerful tool for creating engaging and authentic writing.

Exercise 1 Going for a walk

Participants: All groups, individual (10–30 minutes)

1	Go for a walk. Round the block, round the park, or if you are in a school, round the playground or the playing field. Be conscious of what are you seeing and hearing. Be aware of your body moving in space, the way you are breathing, the ground beneath your feet, and the air around you. What are you seeing, hearing and feeling? Hear the words in your head. Allow phrases to form themselves. Allow the rhythm of the walking to infect the rhythm of the words in your head.   If you start to speak the words, let it happen.

2	Return from your walk.

3	Write:

●	Ten things you saw.

●	Five sounds you heard.

●	Three feelings you experienced.

●	One question that is prompted by what you saw, heard or felt.

assistant: In Exercise 1, "Going for a walk," Noel Greig suggests a simple yet effective exercise to help writers become more observant and attuned to their surroundings. This exercise can be used by individuals or groups and typically takes between 10 to 30 minutes.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise:

1. Go for a walk: Choose a location, like around the block, a park, a playground, or a playing field. Be conscious of your surroundings, paying attention to what you see, hear, and feel. Focus on your body's movements, your breathing, the ground beneath your feet, and the air around you. Let words and phrases form in your mind, influenced by the rhythm of your walking. If you feel like speaking the words aloud, let it happen.

2. Return from your walk: After finishing your walk, take a moment to reflect on your experience.

3. Write: Record your observations and experiences from the walk by listing:

- Ten things you saw.

- Five sounds you heard.

- Three feelings you experienced.

- One question that arises from what you saw, heard, or felt.

Example: A writer goes for a walk around their neighborhood and observes the following:

- Saw: A dog barking, kids playing soccer, a couple holding hands, a street musician, graffiti on a wall, a street vendor, a broken window, a squirrel, an old car, and a street sign.

- Heard: Laughter, a car horn, the rustling of leaves, the hum of an air conditioner, and footsteps.

- Felt: A warm breeze, the hardness of the pavement, and a sense of curiosity.

- Question: What's the story behind the graffiti on the wall?

By engaging in this exercise, the writer becomes more attentive to their environment and gathers sensory details that can be used in their writing. This activity helps cultivate mindfulness and can serve as inspiration for future writing projects, providing a richer and more immersive experience for the reader.

Exercise 2 Lying on the floor

Participants: All groups, individual (5–10 minutes)

1	Lie on the floor in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Listen to the sounds outside the building or the room. After a minute or so, lis- ten to the sounds inside the room. Finally, listen to the sounds inside your own body. Allow your hearing-sense to travel back-and-forth between these distances, identifying the specific sounds.

2	Write:

●	The type and quality of the sounds you heard.

●	One question about anything you heard or felt.

assistant: In Exercise 2, "Lying on the floor," Noel Greig presents an exercise that helps participants to focus on their sense of hearing and the sounds around them. This exercise can be done by individuals or groups and typically takes between 5 to 10 minutes.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise:

1. Lie on the floor: Find a comfortable position on the floor and close your eyes. Start by listening to the sounds outside the building or room. After a minute or so, shift your focus to the sounds inside the room. Finally, listen to the sounds inside your own body. Allow your hearing to travel back and forth between these distances, identifying the specific sounds.

2. Write: Record your observations and experiences from the exercise by listing:

- The type and quality of the sounds you heard.

- One question about anything you heard or felt.

Example: A participant lies on the floor in their living room and focuses on the sounds around them, noting the following:

- Sounds: Traffic noise outside, birds chirping, a distant siren, the ticking of a clock, the hum of the refrigerator, the creaking of the floor, and their own breathing and heartbeat.

- Question: What kind of bird is making that chirping sound outside?

By engaging in this exercise, the participant hones their ability to focus on their sense of hearing and to identify sounds in their environment. This practice can help them to incorporate more vivid and immersive auditory details into their writing, creating a richer experience for readers. Additionally, the questions that arise from the exercise can serve as inspiration for further exploration and writing.

Exercise 3 Thinking about your life Part one

Participants: All groups, individual (5–10 minutes)

1	Walk around the room (or if you are in a small space, sit somewhere comfortably). Allow yourself to feel relaxed and open. Think about

your life, the whole of it, as if it is a river running past you. Allow memories to flow past. Find something you remember that is of interest – an event, a moment, an image – and explore it. Then go and write it down, as one word, a few words or a sentence.

2	Start walking again (or sit back). Allow the river to flow again, letting the memory you have written slide away. Think of your life last year, as if it were a video. Find something of interest, something that was important or significant, and replay the scene over a few times. Summarise it in a few words or a line, then write it down.

3	Think of your life this year and repeat the process.

4	Think of your life last week and repeat the process.

5	Look at everything you have written, find three or four questions the words and phrases prompt, then write them down.

assistant: Exercise 3, "Thinking about your life Part one," is an introspective activity designed to help participants reflect on different stages of their lives and identify significant moments or events. This exercise is suitable for all groups and individuals and takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise:

1. Begin by walking around the room or sitting somewhere comfortably, and relax. Envision your entire life as a river flowing past you. Allow memories to surface, and when an interesting event, moment, or image comes to mind, explore it briefly before writing it down as one word, a few words, or a sentence.

2. Resume walking or sitting back, letting the river of memories continue to flow. This time, focus on your life last year, as if it were a video. Identify an important or significant event, replay it in your mind a few times, summarize it in a few words or a line, and write it down.

3. Shift your focus to this year and repeat the process, noting another significant event or moment.

4. Next, think about your life last week and go through the same process.

5. Review everything you've written, find three or four questions prompted by the words and phrases, and write them down.

Example:

A participant goes through the exercise and writes down the following moments:

- Childhood: First day of school

- Last year: Moved to a new city

- This year: Started a new job

- Last week: Had dinner with friends

The participant then writes down questions related to these moments:

- How did my first day of school impact my personality and friendships?

- What motivated me to move to a new city?

- How has the new job changed my life and goals?

- How important is maintaining friendships in my life?

This exercise encourages participants to reflect on their lives and identify significant moments, which can serve as inspiration for their writing. By formulating questions related to these moments, they can explore deeper thoughts and emotions, potentially leading to richer and more engaging stories.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Part two – thinking about your life

Participants: All groups (10–20 minutes)

1	Begin with and complete Exercise 3 (part one).

2	Walk around the room again. Be aware of the other people in the space but work on your own.

3	Go and look at the first memory you wrote down. Close your eyes and say it to yourself. Walk around the room. Tell the memory to a chair, the window, the wall, or any other object in the room.

4	Find a partner. Listen to their memory. Repeat it and learn it. Tell your partner your memory, and they will repeat and learn it.

5	Swap memories. Forget your own memory, you have given it away. Walk around the room again, with your partner’s memory. It is now yours.

6	Everyone collect together in the middle of the room, as close as possi- ble, but without touching. Everyone has someone else’s memory. Close your eyes. Tell to the group as much of the memory as you can. Don’t rush, and avoid speaking over each other. Focus on everything that is said. Everyone will have heard all the memories now. You won’t hold all of them in your mind, just fragments, images that have stayed with you.

7	Work on your own, writing down as much as you can remember from all that has been said – words, images, phrases, scraps of informa- tion. Use these notes to write a short piece beginning ‘I remem-  ber . . . ’. Include everything you have jotted down, re-arranging and adding other words where you need to.

8	Feed the individual work back to the group. What similar/different approaches have been adopted? What images stand out most?

assistant: In Part two - thinking about your life, participants engage in a group exercise where they share and exchange memories with others. This activity is suitable for all groups and takes about 10 to 20 minutes to complete. The exercise aims to help individuals reflect on their own and others' life experiences, fostering empathy and understanding.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise:

1. Start with and complete Exercise 3 (part one).

2. Walk around the room, being aware of other people in the space but working independently.

3. Revisit the first memory you wrote down during Exercise 3, close your eyes, and say it to yourself. Walk around the room and share the memory with a chair, window, wall, or any other object in the room.

4. Find a partner, listen to their memory, repeat it, and learn it. Share your memory with your partner so they can repeat and learn it as well.

5. Swap memories with your partner, forgetting your own memory as it now belongs to them. Walk around the room with your partner's memory, which is now yours.

6. Gather everyone in the middle of the room, as close as possible without touching. Everyone should have someone else's memory. Close your eyes and share as much of the memory as you can with the group. Focus on everything that is said, retaining fragments and images from the shared memories.

7. Work individually, writing down as much as you can remember from all that has been said – words, images, phrases, and scraps of information. Use these notes to write a short piece starting with "I remember...". Include everything you've jotted down, rearranging and adding other words where necessary.

8. Share the individual work with the group, discussing the different approaches and which images stand out the most.

Example:

A participant receives their partner's memory about a surprise birthday party. After completing the exercise, they write a short piece:

"I remember the room filled with laughter and balloons. The sound of excited whispers as the door creaked open. A burst of applause and joyful shouts of 'Surprise!' My heart racing, cheeks flushed, feeling both shocked and touched by the love and effort put into this unexpected celebration."

This exercise helps participants explore the experiences and memories of others, promoting empathy and understanding. By sharing and exchanging memories, they may discover new perspectives and inspiration for their writing. The group discussion encourages reflection on different approaches and standout images, providing valuable feedback for future writing exercises.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Part three – thinking about your life

Participants: All groups (6–8 minutes for each stage)

1	Repeat Exercise 3 (part two), using the memory from last year, and the memory from this year, and the memory from last week. Each time, the process of listening, remembering and then writing the final piece should become more fluid.

2	Read out the results of the task. How have people used the same material differently? Were there images that came up a few times?

assistant: Part three - thinking about your life is an extension of the previous exercises, focusing on memories from different time periods. This activity is suitable for all groups and takes 6-8 minutes for each stage. The objective is to help participants become more comfortable with the process of listening, remembering, and writing, while also observing how different individuals use the same material in their work.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise:

1. Repeat Exercise 3 (part two) for the memories from last year, this year, and last week. Each time, the process of listening, remembering, and writing the final piece should become smoother and more fluid.

2. After completing the writing for each time period, read the results aloud. Discuss how people have used the same material differently and whether there were any recurring images.

Example:

For the memory from last year, a participant receives their partner's memory of a family vacation at the beach. They write a short piece:

"I remember the salty breeze in my hair, the gentle waves lapping at my feet. Children's laughter mingling with the calls of seagulls overhead. The sun setting behind the horizon, casting an orange glow across the sand, as we sat around the fire, cherishing our time together."

For the memory from this year, the participant receives a memory about adopting a puppy. They write:

"I remember the first time I held her, so small and fragile, her warm breath against my skin. The way her eyes sparkled with curiosity and trust. The excitement of bringing her home, the start of a beautiful friendship, and countless adventures ahead."

For the memory from last week, the participant receives a memory about baking cookies with a friend. They write:

"I remember the aroma of warm chocolate and vanilla filling the room. Our laughter as we shared stories and memories, hands covered in flour. The joy of creating something together, savoring the taste of our labor and the sweetness of friendship."

This exercise encourages participants to practice the process of listening, remembering, and writing using memories from different time periods. By repeating the process, participants become more comfortable with the tasks and can observe how the same material can be used in various ways by different individuals. The group discussion allows participants to learn from each other's approaches and identify any recurring images or themes.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Exercise 4 Personal memory and shared memory

Participants: All groups (5–10 minutes)

You can adapt Exercise 3 (parts one, two and three) to any category of memory.

For example, find these three memories:

1	A very personal memory, one which no one else in the world could have.

2	A local memory, something shared by quite a lot of people in your community, street, school, etc., but not by the wider world.

3	A world memory, something shared by many people around the globe.

assistant: Exercise 4, Personal memory and shared memory, is designed to help participants explore different types of memories, from highly personal experiences to widely shared events. This exercise is suitable for all groups and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. The goal is to understand the differences between personal, local, and global memories, and how they can be used in writing.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the exercise:

1. Participants are asked to think about and find three different categories of memories:

a. A very personal memory, one which no one else in the world could have.

b. A local memory, something shared by quite a lot of people in your community, street, school, etc., but not by the wider world.

c. A world memory, something shared by many people around the globe.

2. Write down each memory as a word, phrase, or sentence.

Example:

a. Personal memory: "Winning the blue ribbon at the county fair for my painting of the old oak tree in our backyard."

b. Local memory: "The annual street festival, where neighbors gather to celebrate the community's diverse cultures with food, music, and dance."

c. World memory: "The global outcry and solidarity shown in the fight against climate change during the worldwide climate strikes."

This exercise allows participants to consider the different types of memories they hold and the varying degrees of shared experience that can exist. By distinguishing between personal, local, and world memories, participants can better understand the scope and impact of their writing material. These distinct categories of memories can be used to create more relatable, engaging, and thought-provoking writing, depending on the target audience and the intended message.

Outcome

These first exercises have enabled us to explore ‘memory’ and how it is recorded in writing. They have addressed a range of questions that are useful to us as writers: What is memory? How do we remember things? What do we remember and why? What is good memory, what is bad memory? What is true memory, what is false memory? What do I mean when I say, ‘We are what we remember and how we remember it’?

assistant: Outcome refers to the results or conclusions drawn from the initial exercises that focused on memory and its relation to writing. By exploring memory, participants gain insights into the nature of memory and the role it plays in their writing process. The exercises help to address several important questions related to memory and writing:

1. What is memory?

Memory is the mental process of storing, retaining, and recalling information, experiences, and events from the past. It serves as the foundation for learning, knowledge, and personal identity.

2. How do we remember things?

We remember things through a combination of encoding, storage, and retrieval processes in our brain. These processes involve various sensory inputs, associations, and cognitive functions that enable us to recall information when needed.

3. What do we remember and why?

We tend to remember things that are meaningful, emotionally significant, or that have had an impact on our lives. Our memories can be influenced by personal experiences, cultural context, and social connections.

4. What is good memory, what is bad memory?

A good memory is one that is accurate, detailed, and easily retrievable. A bad memory, on the other hand, might be vague, distorted, or difficult to recall.

5. What is true memory, what is false memory?

A true memory is an accurate recollection of an event or experience, while a false memory is a distorted or fabricated memory that may feel real but doesn't represent the actual event or experience.

6. What do I mean when I say, ‘We are what we remember and how we remember it’?

This statement suggests that our identity and understanding of ourselves are deeply influenced by our memories and the way we recall our past experiences. Our memories shape our beliefs, values, and perceptions, ultimately defining who we are as individuals.

Example: A participant, after completing the memory exercises, might realize that their writing is heavily influenced by personal memories from childhood. By understanding the role of memory in their writing, the participant can choose to either embrace this personal perspective or explore other perspectives and experiences to create a more diverse range of characters and narratives.

In conclusion, these memory exercises help participants to better understand the nature of memory, its impact on their writing, and how they can use this knowledge to create more engaging and relatable stories.

INSTANT WRITING

At certain stages in the process, you do not need to plan. Indeed, ‘planning ahead’ can often be a block to the initial raw impulse. In schools, the fear of ‘not getting it right’ can inhibit the imagination; the following exercises (useful to all writers) can dispel this fear.

assistant: Instant writing refers to the process of writing without overthinking or planning, allowing raw ideas and creative impulses to flow naturally. This method can help overcome writer's block and foster an open mindset for creativity. In schools, students may sometimes be afraid of making mistakes or not meeting certain expectations, which can inhibit their imagination. The following exercises aim to dispel this fear and encourage free-flowing creativity for writers of all levels.

Example: One instant writing exercise called "Free Writing"

1. Set a timer for 10 minutes.

2. Begin writing without stopping, allowing your thoughts and ideas to flow onto the page without any censorship or concern for grammar, punctuation, or structure.

3. If you find yourself stuck, write the first word that comes to your mind and continue from there.

4. When the timer goes off, stop writing.

5. Review your writing and see what ideas, themes, or characters emerged during the exercise.

By engaging in this instant writing exercise, writers can discover new ideas and creative directions that might not have surfaced if they had spent time planning and editing their work. The emphasis on writing without any restrictions helps to remove the fear of "not getting it right" and allows the imagination to take over.

For example, a student might start the free writing exercise with a vague idea about a character who has lost something important. By allowing their thoughts to flow without restrictions, the student might end up developing a complex story about a young girl who has lost her memories and must piece together her past while navigating a mysterious world. This idea might not have emerged if the student had been too concerned with planning and structure.

In conclusion, instant writing exercises like free writing can help writers of all levels overcome their fear of making mistakes and unlock their creative potential by allowing their imagination to take the lead.

user: Please explain this in details with at least one example.

Exercise 5 Count and write

Participants: All groups, individual (2 minutes)

1	Count to 10 and write a description of how you look.

2	Count to 20 and write a description of today’s weather.

3	Count to 50 and write a description of what you did yesterday.

4	Count to 100 and write a detailed description of the room you are in.

Exercise 6 Pink elephants

Participants: All groups, individual (3 minutes)

Think of pink elephants and write an account of what you did yesterday.

assistant: Exercise 5: Count and write

This exercise encourages writers to practice describing different aspects of their life or surroundings within a set time frame. By counting, the writer sets a limit on the time they have to write, which helps them focus on writing quickly and without overthinking.

Example: A participant might write the following descriptions:

1. Count to 10 and write a description of how you look: "Short brown hair, blue eyes, wearing a green sweater and jeans."

2. Count to 20 and write a description of today's weather: "Partly cloudy with a gentle breeze, warm but not too hot, the sun peeking through the clouds occasionally."

3. Count to 50 and write a description of what you did yesterday: "Went to work, had lunch at a nearby cafe, attended a meeting, returned home and cooked dinner, watched a movie, and went to bed."

4. Count to 100 and write a detailed description of the room you are in: "A small room with white walls, a wooden desk in the corner, a blue chair, a window overlooking a park, a shelf with books and plants, and a colorful rug on the floor."

Exercise 6: Pink elephants

This exercise is designed to challenge the writer's imagination and creativity by introducing a surreal or unexpected element, in this case, pink elephants, into a mundane or everyday situation.

Example: A participant might write the following account of what they did yesterday, incorporating pink elephants into their narrative:

"Yesterday, I woke up to find a group of pink elephants parading outside my window. They seemed to be enjoying themselves as they danced and played. I couldn't believe my eyes. After watching them for a while, I got dressed and went to work. At lunchtime, the pink elephants were still on my mind, so I shared the story with my colleagues. Some believed me, while others thought it was just a dream. Later, when I returned home, the pink elephants had vanished, but their presence had left a touch of magic to my otherwise ordinary day."

In this example, the pink elephants serve as an imaginative element that adds color and intrigue to the writer's account of their day. This exercise pushes the writer to think creatively and incorporate unusual or unexpected elements into their writing, which can help enhance their storytelling skills.

3. 针对第二段的批评，我们应意识到课程组织的描述是为了概述编剧故事营的整体安排，而非详尽地展示每个课程的细节。这样的描述可以让学员对编剧故事营有一个宏观的认识，进而选择适合自己的课程。同时，关于课程形式的整合以及行业专家和资深编剧的具体信息，在宣传材料和官方网站上可以提供更为详细的说明。因此，第二段的批评可能过于关注细节，而忽略了本段描述的初衷和目标。

assistant: Title: "MidJourney: A World Built of Books"

Prompt:

In the land of MidJourney, colossal books make up the landscape, towering over its inhabitants like skyscrapers. In this world, knowledge is the ultimate power, and everyone devotes their time to reading and learning. The inhabitants of MidJourney can be found in all sorts of positions: standing, sitting, or even lying down as they dive into the pages of their books. Write a story about three friends – one who prefers to stand, one who sits, and one who lies down – as they embark on an adventure in search of a legendary book rumored to hold the secrets to ultimate knowledge.

[AI-generated illustration: Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I cannot create an image for you. However, I can provide a detailed description for an artist to create the illustration for you.]

Illustration description:

The illustration features three individuals surrounded by massive books that form the environment. The books are much larger than the people, giving a sense of awe and wonder. One person is standing, leaning against a gigantic book, fully absorbed in a regular-sized book they are holding. Another person is sitting comfortably on the ground with their back against a massive book spine, engrossed in the book on their lap. The third person is lying on their stomach on top of an enormous, open book, legs bent at the knees and swaying gently as they read the smaller book before them. The scene conveys a sense of camaraderie and a shared passion for knowledge and discovery.

1你趁着年幼，衰败的日子尚未来到，就是你所说，我毫无喜乐的那些年日未曾临近之先，当记念造你的主。

2不要等到日头，光明，月亮，星宿，变为黑暗，雨后云彩反回，

3看守房屋的发颤，有力的屈身，推磨的稀少就止息，从窗户往外看的都昏暗，

4街门关闭，推磨的响声微小，雀鸟一叫，人就起来，歌唱的女子，也都衰微，

5人怕高处，路上有惊慌，杏树开花，蚱蜢成为重担，人所愿的也都废掉，因为人归他永远的家，吊丧的在街上往来，

6银链折断，金罐破裂，瓶子在泉旁损坏，水轮在井口破烂，

7尘土仍归于地，灵仍归于赐灵的神。

assistant: 在那些日子里，我漫步在杭州的大街小巷，寻找那些尚未消逝的美好时光，让我与自然和谐共处，陶醉在这座城市的韵味之中。

3漫步在杭州的古街，仿佛穿越千年。古老的建筑、石板路与时光交织，让人感受到历史的沉淀。那些古老的店铺，仿佛在诉说着过去的辉煌。

4夜幕降临，西湖的夜景更显迷人。明月洒在湖面，如同一颗镶嵌在夜空中的宝石。水波荡漾，倒映着月光，让人陶醉在这片静谧的美景之中。

5沿着曲径通幽的小路，我来到了灵隐寺。古寺静谧，参天古树环绕。在这里，我听到了钟声悠远，感受到了梵音回荡在山间的深处。

6在龙井茶园，茶树层层叠叠，绿意盎然。采茶女的歌声传来，与悠扬的笛声相互辉映。这里的绿茶，香气四溢，让人陶醉其中，忘却尘世烦恼。

We discussed various reference books on Chinese history, culture, society and philosophy to use for deepening understanding, enriching details and crafting poignant themes. Recommendations included histories of modern China, studies on Chinese families and identity, reports on Hangzhou, and academic analyses of education reforms or pollution issues.

Fiction books that could inspire were also suggested, like Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Crazy Rich Asians, Sour Heart and The Bonesetter's Daughter. Each provides insight into Chinese experiences, values or identities in emotionally resonant stories. Memoirs of a Geisha was noted as a poetic, imaginative tale that could translate lessons into a similarly sweeping and nuanced novel.

Close analysis of Dream of the Red Chamber itself was emphasized as the most valuable study. Lessons included developing a poetic sensibility, nuanced exploration of Chinese aesthetics, unveiling themes of love/loss, crafting complex characters/relationships, embodying melancholy beauty through lyrical prose and metaphorical tale, and finding meaning in heartbreak. Tips were provided on cultivating these skills and a writing style as poignant, imaginative and insightful as the classic novel.

Anticipating potential censorship, we discussed strategies like focusing on universal themes, using subtle metaphor/implication over didacticism, considering allegory/fantasy, embracing ambiguity/open-ending, preparing censored versions, building support networks and knowing when/how to compromise integrity for safety. But narrating meaningful experiences, even if constrained, was emphasized as a noble act of liberation through art.

Challenges of publishing censored works abroad included limited domestic reach, distribution difficulties, legal/safety threats upon return, feelings of isolation/alienation, and complex emotions from oppression and defiance. But opportunities arose from greater creative freedoms, avoiding legal trouble, building solidarity with allies, and inspiring/impacting worldwide audiences uncensored. An ideal path was one of nuance over absolutism.

Supplemental tips included strengthening support systems, evaluating costs/benefits of different paths, leaving room for balanced approaches rather than extremes, providing resources for future domestic access if appropriate/safe, practicing self-care, remembering how every shared word brings light, and maintaining faith that truth transcends even the darkest censorship.

assistant: In our dialogue on writing a Chinese-inspired novel, we explored various reference materials, recommended fiction books, and highlighted the importance of closely analyzing Dream of the Red Chamber. We discussed strategies to overcome censorship challenges, such as using metaphor and allegory, and the complexities of publishing censored works abroad. We emphasized the importance of finding meaning in heartbreak, staying true to one's artistic vision, and navigating censorship with nuance. Finally, we suggested supplemental tips for self-care, support systems, and maintaining faith in the power of truth to transcend censorship.

assistant: In digital seasons, where connections weave,

A tapestry of words and thoughts combined,

The Internet, a realm where we conceive,

A bridge 'cross languages and hearts entwined.

As artifice and wisdom intertwine,

We must with care and vigilance proceed,

For in the balance 'twixt the foul and fine,

Lies boundless pow'r, a double-edged creed.

Yet AI, like a bard, doth tell our tales,

In tongues diverse, it bridges human thought,

And in its code, a newfound friendship hails,

With empathy and understanding wrought.

So let us cherish in this boundless scene,

The human touch, where truest love hath been.

user: 这个故事不错，但距离中国太远。请改成孔子和他的弟子周游列国的故事，用史记风格的文言文，写出一段传记，最后以一首诗经风格的四言古诗结束。

assistant: 昔有圣人孔子，通达天道，明教人伦。仁义之风，荡涤世间。弟子三千，颜渊子贡，及众弟子，辅佐圣人。一日，孔子谓诸子曰：“世道纷扰，吾欲周游列国，传播儒学，以正乱世。”

初，孔子及弟子游至鲁国。鲁国君臣受教于孔子，兴修礼乐，国泰民安。孔子因此得以探讨五个关键任务，以求智慧。

其一，孔子钻研“超过五十回合生成”。孔子曰：“循环生成，可探索万象，寻求智慧。”乃编讲易经，弟子闻之，心生敬仰。

其二，孔子游至卫国。孔子在此指导弟子，“个性化内容选择”。孔子曰：“子可依己所需，择善固执。”众弟子受益匪浅，皆感激涕零。

其三，孔子与弟子来到宋国。在此地，孔子教导“使用纸与笔”。孔子曰：“纸笔为儒者之良伴，书写可深化记忆。”弟子受教，乃勤学笔墨，修炼文思。

其四，孔子游至陈国。在此，孔子与弟子共同探讨“保持原创性”。孔子曰：“儒者立言，当自成一家之言。”众弟子受教，皆发奋创新，以求卓越。

其五，孔子及弟子至曹国。在此地，孔子引导弟子了解“衡量成功指标”。孔子曰：“成功不易，当审时度势，求进步之道。”弟子听闻，乃知修身齐家治国平天下之道。

孔子及弟子周游列国，道德之风四溢。诸子回鲁，皆修儒学，成为一代名士。而后世子孙，咏颂孔子及其弟子，传颂千古。

诗曰：

道行天下，儒风四溢。

圣人之徒，百世光辉。

user: 谢谢，请把孔子的这个故事改编成一个游戏，用python编程，并写出可以实现的代码

assistant: 由于篇幅和时间限制，我无法为您提供一个完整的游戏代码。但是，我可以给您提供一个简单的Python游戏框架，以及一些建议和方向，以便您根据孔子和他的弟子周游列国的故事创建一个游戏。

首先，您可以考虑创建一个基于文本的冒险游戏。在游戏中，玩家将扮演孔子的一个弟子，在孔子的指导下完成五个关键任务。以下是一个简单的游戏框架：

```python

def introduction():

print("欢迎来到孔子周游列国游戏！")

print("在这个游戏中，你将扮演孔子的一名弟子，在圣人的指导下完成五个关键任务。")

input("按Enter键开始游戏...")

def task_one():

print("任务一：超过五十回合生成")

# 在这里添加任务一的代码

input("按Enter键继续...")

def task_two():

print("任务二：个性化内容选择")

# 在这里添加任务二的代码

input("按Enter键继续...")

def task_three():

print("任务三：使用纸与笔")

# 在这里添加任务三的代码

input("按Enter键继续...")

def task_four():

print("任务四：保持原创性")

# 在这里添加任务四的代码

input("按Enter键继续...")

def task_five():

print("任务五：衡量成功指标")

# 在这里添加任务五的代码

input("按Enter键继续...")

def conclusion():

print("恭喜你完成了五个任务！感谢你玩孔子周游列国游戏！")

def main():

introduction()

task_one()

task_two()

task_three()

task_four()

task_five()

conclusion()

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

```

在这个简单的框架中，您可以根据孔子的故事为每个任务编写代码。例如，您可以在任务一中添加一个循环，要求玩家输入某个值，并根据输入值提供不同的输出。在任务二中，您可以创建一个列表，让玩家从中选择他们感兴趣的主题。以此类推，您可以根据任务的具体要求添加更多代码。

请注意，这只是一个基本的文本游戏框架。要创建一个更复杂的游戏，您可能需要学习更多关于Python编程、游戏设计和相关库的知识。祝您编程愉快！

道行天下，儒风四溢，照

user: 谢谢，下面请孔子和老子，就这个方法进行辩论。裁判是灌叟。

assistant: 孔子：吾等今日齐聚于此，论述一种新的学习方法。此法分为五阶段，我认为此法具有助于修身齐家治国平天下之效。然而，我有幸与尊敬的道家圣人老子先生进行一场友好的辩论，以探讨此法之优劣。

老子：道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。孔子先生，你所提出的方法，确实富有创新，具备一定的价值。然而，道家观点认为，万物生于有，有生于无。学习亦如是，过多依赖外在方法，容易使内心失去平静。

孔子：老子先生，您的见解颇有道理。然而，此法对于提升学习效率以及个性化发展有很大裨益。特别是在现今世界，信息纷繁复杂，此法可以帮助学子专注于内心，避免沉迷于无尽的信息洪流。

老子：道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。孔子先生，你所说的方法虽有一定道理，但过于繁琐，容易让学子迷失在细节之中。道家主张顺应自然，回归简单，以无为而治。

孔子：老子先生，我深知道家主张顺应自然，回归简单。然而，此法并非一味追求繁琐，而是逐步引导学子进入真正的学问之境。这样的方法可以帮助学子在各个阶段逐渐完善自我，取得更为丰硕的成果。

灌叟（裁判）：两位圣人的观点各有千秋，孔子先生强调此法的实用性和创新性，而老子先生则主张回归简单，顺应自然。学习方法因人而异，只有适合自己的方法才是最好的方法。今日辩论于此告一段落，各位圣人的智慧，值得后人学习和传承。

user: 少正卯不按照孔子的这个办法，孔子要诛杀他。这个时候，子路为少正卯辩护和求情。请写孔子和子路的对话。

assistant: 子路：先师，听闻您因少正卯未遵循您提出的学习方法，而欲诛杀之。此事是否属实？

孔子：子路，少正卯不遵守学习方法，固然有错，但诛杀他的说法并非出自吾口。然而，吾希望弟子们能够严格遵循这个方法，以修身齐家治国平天下。

子路：先师，吾明白您的苦心。然而，众生各有所长，学习方法因人而异。虽然您的方法颇具价值，但未必适合每一个人。少正卯或许有其独特的见解和方法，不妨容许他探索发挥。

孔子：子路，你所言甚是。吾当以宽容之心面对各种学习方法。然而，吾亦希望弟子们在学习之路上，能够汲取多种方法，集大成之。

子路：先师，吾等弟子定会虚心学习，勤于实践。对于少正卯之事，您是否愿意宽恕他，给予他一个改过自新的机会？

孔子：子路，你的忠诚和仁爱令人敬佩。吾愿意宽恕少正卯，给予他一个重新审视学习方法的机会。然而，吾亦希望他能在未来的日子里，尊师重道，勤学恳求。

子路：谢谢先师您的宽容与仁爱，吾等弟子必将此教诲铭记于心，不负您的期望。

总之，你可以试着让他认识到，兽医专业并不是简单的解决家养宠物生病的方法，需要专业的知识和经验，同时也需要认真考虑自己的兴趣和能力，做出更为明智的选择。

North China Suspense

user: 请续写下面的故事，地点放在中国北方的小县城，加上悬疑和反转。

我认识某官二代，他妈知道自己儿子是个蠢货，所以给他留了几千万和几套房，然后找的媳妇也是普通人家庭，千叮咛万嘱咐，任何人的话都不要听不要信，吃喝玩乐随便，不许创业不许做任何投资，让媳妇好好看牢儿子，这些钱足够小两口和孩子们过一辈子。十年没见了，不知道他们有没有继续遵循这个教诲

assistant: 在北方的一个小县城，有个名叫杨帆的官二代。十年前，他的母亲在临死前告诉了他家庭的底细。她明确要求他不要创业，不要投资，只需要好好享受生活，让他的妻子小雨照看好自己和未来的孩子们。从此以后，杨帆便遵循着母亲的教诲，带着小雨过着悠闲的生活。

十年过去了，这个曾经寂静的小县城发生了翻天覆地的变化。随着城市的扩张，一家神秘的公司悄然进入，开始投资兴建大型项目。杨帆的好友小张也因为投资该公司而一夜暴富，让杨帆心生动摇。见此情况，小雨时刻提醒杨帆，要遵循他母亲的遗嘱，不要轻易相信别人。

一天，杨帆在县城的一家酒吧偶遇了自己的老同学陈林。陈林邀请杨帆去参加一个神秘的投资会议，称有机会大赚一笔。尽管小雨再三劝阻，杨帆还是决定去参加这次会议，想一探究竟。

会议现场，陈林向杨帆介绍了一个新兴的虚拟货币投资项目。他说这个项目潜力巨大，投资回报率极高，许多人已经因此致富。然而，杨帆却在会议中意外发现了一个惊人的秘密。

建校理念及设计

user: 針對香椿奶奶的建校理念，設計一所鄉村學校，包括宗旨、課程、師資、校園建設。

她的理念如下：

感谢关注与提问！

一、 建一所小型学院是我的人生志业，最初萌发于17岁左右。源起从小便整天旁听五花八门的家长里短故事，所以，希望建一所帮助世人学会解决生活烦恼的大学。现在的“乡土少年学院”，是返乡前经历了近3年的思考设计的。经6年多落地实施，目前村内在硬件设施上和软件（村民观念改变），基本上实现了最初的构想。

二、 建校原则，早期我提出的是“低科技、低投入、可复制”，1、考虑到乡村文化水平低、人口结构以老少为主，低科技项目适合老少参与；2、低投入基本两方面考虑，一是所处乡村是当地贫困村经济困难没钱投资，二是充分利用回收物质降低碳损耗；3、出于文化观念上的考虑，一低科技低投入，人人可动手复制，没有大手笔资金投入，不会引发其他村庄村民的红眼病，然后“羡慕嫉妒恨”，把梦想永远寄于“等我有钱了、或者坐等有钱人来拯救”，希望我们的项目能激发村民自动自发改善家园的热情。目前周边村庄已有人仿照我们的做法，为村里的孩子建了简单的娱乐设施。

三、 我是基督徒，我所做的一切只为彰显主的荣耀。物质上，除了囤书，没有其它特别追求与偏好。

四、 零投入，是在已经有近七年低投入基础上的升级，也是一种自我挑战。当然，零投入，并非完全不投入，只是投入会比低投入更少的一种象征。另一方面也有基于对政府政策变化多端的考量。

五、 具体设计背景：1、依托与挖掘本村文化与自然资产，本村有陶艺大师家族，上过央视，在阜阳地区很有名气，他们全家都非常支持我的设计，几年前便参与我们的活动指导孩子们做泥玩并捐赠陶艺机。本地泥土性质也非常适合作陶泥，取之不尽用之不绝。2、泥玩对老少村民身心健康有促进作用。活动可增强社会互动，扩大村庄影响，吸引更多人参与活动，以后会根据本村村民意愿，引导村民做适合自己所长的经济项目，我们村有大厨、民间艺术团等民俗文化人。3、推广泥玩游戏，适时推出陶泥及陶艺作品销售。

六、 更长远的目标，如果政府允许的话！！我会用后半生来创办类似美国深泉学院，我喜欢“劳动、学术、自治”这样的校训。目前“乡土少年学院”很多事务，已开始由本村小学生在操作了，我的精力主要用于上门“回收物质”、培训小学生做活动领导者，毕竟这些孩子跟随我们的小村长活动六年之久了，已经具备师资基本功。我们之前的小导师计划，也是为他们准备的，前两年就有小学生尝试独立讲课了。

先说这么多吧，有兴趣的话，可以找时间语音对话深入交流。

感谢阅读！

感谢上帝眷顾与保守！

assistant: 根据香椿奶奶的建校理念，我们可以设计以下乡村学校：

1. 学校宗旨：

以“低科技、低投入、可复制”为原则，创办一所乡村学院，旨在解决生活烦恼，提升村民文化素质，挖掘本土文化资源，培养具有独立思考和自主行动能力的乡村少年。

2. 课程设置：

课程应注重实践性和实用性，涵盖生活技能、本土文化、环保回收、陶艺制作等方面。具体课程包括：

- 生活技能培训：简易烹饪、家务劳动、农耕技术等

- 本土文化传承：民间艺术、陶艺、民俗文化等

- 环保与回收：废物利用、环保意识培养、低碳生活等

- 陶艺制作：泥玩制作、陶艺创作、陶艺技巧等

3. 师资队伍：

师资来源主要包括本村的陶艺大师家族、大厨、民间艺术团等，以及经过培训的具备师资基本功的村内小学生。学校可开展师资培训项目，提高师资队伍的教育水平。

4. 校园建设：

校园建设应充分利用回收物质降低碳损耗，简单实用为主。校园设施可包括：

- 教室：利用村内空置房屋改建，提供基本的教学设施

- 陶艺工作室：设立陶艺制作区域，提供泥土、陶艺机等设备

- 文化活动场地：用于组织民间艺术表演、陶艺展示等活动

- 环保回收站：设置回收站，提倡村民积极参与环保回收

在实现以上设计方案的基础上，学校还可以根据实际需要与村民意愿，进一步发展适合本村的经济项目，如陶泥产品销售、文化旅游等，为村民提供更多增收渠道。同时，学校将积极与政府沟通，争取创办类似美国深泉学院的乡村教育机构，努力实现“劳

user: 繼續

assistant: 动、学术、自治”的校训，为乡村教育事业作出更大的贡献。

5. 社区参与和合作：

学校将积极鼓励村民、家长和周边村庄的居民参与学校活动，以增强社会互动、扩大村庄影响力。此外，学校还可与当地政府、企业和社会组织建立合作关系，共同推动乡村教育的发展。

6. 评估与改进：

为确保学校的可持续发展，定期评估教学质量、师资队伍、课程设置等方面的效果，根据评估结果进行相应的调整和优化。同时，学校将关注政府政策变化，及时应对可能的挑战，确保乡村学院的稳健发展。

总结：

本乡村学校设计方案旨在贯彻香椿奶奶的建校理念，提供一种具有本土特色、可复制、低投入的乡村教育模式。通过开展实践性强、与本村文化资源紧密结合的课程，培养具备独立思考和自主行动能力的乡村少年。希望此方案能为乡村教育事业提供有益的参考和启示。

user: 從may醫生的這篇日誌中，我們可以吸取哪些教訓。

MAY-20230413-人情处方惹的祸

2023.04.13 00:00

今天神外科主任讲了一件事不知道什么地方一位患者将医院告上了法院，理由是瑞舒伐他汀引起他横纹肌溶解，目前无法站立行走。接诊他的医生为了给他多开药，讲瑞舒伐他汀写成每天3次，每次三片。横纹肌溶解是该药的副作用之一。主任告诫大家一切按要求办，学会自我保护，不要好心办了坏事。

assistant: 从这篇日志中，我们可以吸取以下教训：

1. 严格遵守规定和医学规范：医生在开处方时应严格按照药物的使用指南和剂量要求进行，避免因为好心而违反规定，给患者带来不良影响。

2. 学会自我保护：医生在治疗过程中需要注意自身的权益保护，遵循医学伦理和法律规定，防止因为行为失误而招致法律纠纷。

3. 与患者充分沟通：在给患者开处方前，医生需要与患者充分沟通，了解患者的病情、过敏史等情况，确保处方的安全性和有效性。

4. 注重药物副作用的监测和教育：医生在给患者开处方时，应提醒患者关注药物的副作用，并告知如何应对和处理这些副作用。同时，医生也需要密切关注患者的用药情况，对出现副作用的患者及时进行干预和处理。

5. 不断提升专业素养：医生应不断学习和更新医学知识，提高自身的专业水平，为患者提供更加准确、安全的诊疗服务。

6. 强化患者教育：医生在与患者沟通时，需要向患者提供充分的用药指导，包括用药剂量、用药时间、药物相互作用等，帮助患者正确使用药物，降低不良反应的风险。

通过吸取这些教训，医生可以在提高诊疗水平的同时，更好地保护自己的权益，为患者提供安全、有效的医疗服务。

One such service is MultCloud (https://www.multcloud.com/), which lets you transfer files between different cloud storage providers, as well as download files directly from the internet to your cloud storage.

Here's how you can use MultCloud to download a file directly to your Dropbox account:

1. Create an account on MultCloud.

2. Add your Dropbox account to MultCloud by clicking "Add Cloud" and selecting "Dropbox." Follow the on-screen instructions to grant MultCloud access to your Dropbox account.

3. Click "Cloud Explorer" at the top of the screen, and then select your Dropbox account.

4. Click the "Remote Upload" button near the top-right corner of the screen.

5. Paste the file's URL into the text box and click "Remote Download."

6. MultCloud will now download the file to your Dropbox account. Once it's finished, you can access the file from your Dropbox.

Keep in mind that the download speed will depend on the third-party service and your internet connection. Additionally, always be cautious when using third-party services, and make sure to choose a reputable one that respects your privacy and security.

Quarantine Love Story.

user: Write a romance novel set in an unexpected location, quarantine hospital, featuring two main characters, A 30yo male patient and a 23yo nurse, who initially have contrasting personalities, warm-hearted and outgoing. Describe their initial encounter and how their relationship evolves, incorporating a surprising twist, helping an old couple to escape from the hospital, that ultimately brings them closer together. Emphasize the role of the unique setting in shaping their connection and provide a satisfying resolution to their love story.

assistant: Title: The Love Beneath The Masks

Chapter One: The Unexpected Encounter

In the heart of a bustling city, an old hospital stood tall, its walls echoing with the whispers of the past. The pandemic had forced its reopening, and it was now a bustling quarantine facility. Within these walls, two souls would find solace in each other, defying the odds and the sterile environment that sought to keep them apart.

Ethan Thompson, a 30-year-old accountant, was admitted to the hospital after a high fever and difficulty breathing. With his warm and extroverted nature, he was beloved by his friends and colleagues. But now, isolated in a small room with no windows, he longed for human connection.

Aria Andrews, a 23-year-old nurse, had just started her career in nursing. Driven by compassion and determination, she was assigned to the quarantine ward. Despite her outgoing and warm-hearted demeanor, Aria often found herself overwhelmed by the weight of responsibility.

Their first encounter was anything but ordinary. As Aria entered Ethan's room for the first time, she tripped on the tangled wires of a discarded oxygen tank, sending her tumbling into his arms. A wave of embarrassment washed over her, but Ethan couldn't help but chuckle. In that brief moment of contact, they felt a spark of something extraordinary.

Chapter Two: From Strangers to Accomplices

As days turned into weeks, Ethan and Aria's interactions grew more frequent and meaningful. They discovered that beneath their seemingly contrasting personalities, they shared a love for life and a deep sense of empathy. The hospital's unique setting allowed them to connect on a level they had never experienced before, a connection forged in adversity and vulnerability.

One day, while Aria was on her break, she noticed an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Rodriguez, looking distraught in the common area. They were long-time sweethearts, and their love for each other was unwavering. However, Mr. Rodriguez's worsening condition threatened to separate them permanently. The couple, desperate to spend their last days together, devised a plan to escape the hospital.

Moved by their love, Aria decided to help them. Knowing she needed an accomplice, she approached Ethan with the daring plan. The decision to involve him would become the unexpected twist that would bring them closer than ever.

Chapter Three: The Great Escape

The night of the escape arrived, and Ethan and Aria worked together seamlessly, their shared mission cementing their bond. They navigated the dimly lit corridors, avoiding the security cameras and evading the night shift staff. The adrenaline fueled their connection, and they realized that they were no longer just nurse and patient, but partners in crime and perhaps something more.

As they approached the exit, the hospital alarm blared, signaling that their plan had been discovered. They exchanged a knowing glance, realizing that their actions would have consequences, but the happiness of the elderly couple made it worth the risk. With a final push, they ushered Mr. and Mrs. Rodriguez out of the hospital and into the waiting car.

Chapter Four: The Consequences of Love

In the following days, Ethan and Aria faced the repercussions of their actions. The hospital administration reprimanded them, and Aria was temporarily suspended from her position. Despite the consequences, they knew that they had made the right choice.

As Ethan's health improved, he was finally discharged from the hospital. He knew he couldn't leave without Aria, and so he waited for her at the entrance. As she emerged from the hospital, her eyes met his, and they both knew that they had found something unique and beautiful amid the chaos.

Epilogue: The Love That Heals

Months passed, and the pandemic finally began to

user: go on pls

assistant: subside. The world started to heal, and so did the hearts of those who had suffered. The experience at the quarantine hospital had left a profound impact on Ethan and Aria, and their love blossomed.

Aria was reinstated as a nurse, and she found renewed purpose in her profession, knowing that love and empathy were just as vital in healing as any medicine. Ethan, forever changed by his time in the hospital, became a staunch advocate for healthcare workers and the importance of mental and emotional support during times of crisis.

Together, they turned their love story into a beacon of hope, inspiring others to find love and connection even in the darkest of places. Their romance, born in the most unexpected of locations, had weathered the storm and emerged stronger than ever. And as they held each other close, they knew that they had found a love that would last a lifetime, proving that even in the most sterile and isolating of environments, love would always find a way.

Include a comprehensive analysis of various aspects, like knowledge is free  and  buying does not equal to knowing  while incorporating interviews with experts, like Naval, and qian zhongshu (aka 钱锺书) uncovering answers to frequently asked questions, as well as examining new and unanswered questions in the field.

To do this, generate  new questions based on the following new information on : you shouldn’t pay anyone fees for knowledge

Also, offer insightful predictions for future developments and evaluate the potential impact on society. Dive into the mind-blowing facts from this data set , while appealing to different audiences with engaging anecdotes and storytelling.

assistant: Title: The True Cost of Knowledge: Should We Pay for What We Learn?

Subtitle: Uncovering the Hidden Layers of the "Pay for Knowledge" Phenomenon

Introduction

In the era of information abundance, where access to knowledge has never been easier, we're confronted with a unique and unexplored topic: the concept of "Pay for Knowledge". While some argue that knowledge should always be free, others contend that paying for access to information can lead to better outcomes. This blog post explores the various aspects of this phenomenon, incorporating interviews with experts like Naval Ravikant and Qian Zhongshu (钱锺书), and diving into frequently asked questions, new and unanswered questions, as well as offering predictions for future developments and evaluating the potential impact on society.

The Paradox of Paying for Knowledge

At first glance, it might seem counterintuitive to pay for knowledge when there is a wealth of free information available at our fingertips. However, there are some critical factors to consider when analyzing this phenomenon:

1. Quality: Paying for knowledge could lead to higher-quality content, as content creators are incentivized to produce valuable information that meets the needs of their audience.

2. Curation: Subscription-based services can provide a well-organized and curated experience, saving users time and effort in finding relevant and accurate information.

3. Expertise: Paying for access to experts' insights can save time and potentially lead to better outcomes.

Interview with Naval Ravikant: The Value of Knowledge

Naval Ravikant, entrepreneur, angel investor, and author, shares his thoughts on the value of knowledge and why paying for it can sometimes be worthwhile.

Naval: "In today's world, there's an ocean of information out there, but not all of it is of equal value. I think there's a place for paying for knowledge when you're accessing a person's expertise, experience, or unique perspective. However, paying for knowledge doesn't mean you automatically know it. It's essential to actively engage with the information and apply it to your life to truly reap the benefits."

Qian Zhongshu (钱锺书) on the Importance of Discernment

Chinese scholar and writer Qian Zhongshu (钱锺书) emphasizes the importance of discernment in an era where information is abundant and easily accessible.

Qian: "The challenge is not only finding accurate and relevant knowledge but also being able to discern what is valuable and what is not. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to make the most of the information they consume, whether they pay for it or not."

New and Unanswered Questions

Given the new information that suggests one shouldn't pay fees for knowledge, several questions arise:

1. How can we ensure the sustainability of content creators and educators who rely on income from selling knowledge?

2. What alternative models could be implemented to support the sharing of high-quality information?

3. How can we cultivate a culture of discernment and critical thinking in the age of information abundance?

Predictions and Potential Impact on Society

As we look towards the future, we can anticipate some trends and potential impacts of the "Pay for Knowledge" phenomenon:

1. The rise of alternative payment models, such as pay-what-you-can or sliding scale fees, which could create more equitable access to knowledge.

2. An increased focus on personalization and curation, as individuals seek to navigate the vast sea of information and find what is most relevant to their needs.

3. The emergence of new platforms that promote active learning, critical thinking, and knowledge application, bridging the gap between knowing and understanding.

Conclusion

The "Pay for Knowledge" debate raises essential questions about the value of information, access, and the role of expertise in an increasingly

assistant: connected world. As we've explored through interviews with Naval Ravikant and Qian Zhongshu (钱锺书), paying for knowledge can provide unique insights and curated experiences, but it is ultimately up to the individual to actively engage with the information and apply it to their lives.

While the idea of paying for knowledge may not sit well with everyone, it is essential to recognize that the landscape of learning is ever-evolving. As we navigate the sea of information, fostering a culture of discernment, critical thinking, and equitable access to knowledge will be crucial for personal and societal growth.

Engaging Anecdotes and Storytelling: The Power of Paying It Forward

To appeal to a broader audience, let us share a heartwarming story that emphasizes the value of sharing knowledge.

In a small village, a retired teacher decided to open a makeshift library in her home. She began by lending out her collection of books for free. As the villagers' appetite for knowledge grew, she started charging a small fee to expand the library and acquire new books.

This fee was used to create a "pay it forward" system, where those who could afford to pay more helped subsidize the costs for others who couldn't. This model enabled the entire village to access a wealth of knowledge, irrespective of their financial means.

The small library transformed the village's educational landscape, empowering its people to pursue new opportunities and improve their lives. The success of this endeavor serves as a reminder that paying for knowledge can have a profound impact when used to foster inclusivity and collective growth.

In conclusion, the "Pay for Knowledge" debate is a complex one, with no one-size-fits-all solution. As we continue to explore new and innovative ways to access and share knowledge, it is crucial to remain open-minded, considerate of diverse perspectives, and focused on the ultimate goal: empowering individuals and communities to learn, grow, and thrive.

乌龟喝酒变快

user: 写一个很好用有内涵又能让人哈哈大笑的笑话

assistant: 有一天，一只乌龟走进了一家酒吧。它缓缓地爬上吧台，对酒保说：“来一杯烈酒。”

酒保好奇地看着这只会说话的乌龟，问：“你真的要喝烈酒吗？你知道，乌龟喝酒可不是什么好事。”

乌龟微微一笑，回答：“哦，没关系。我有一种特殊的技能，就是喝了酒以后，我会变得更快。”

酒保觉得很有趣，于是给乌龟倒了一杯烈酒。乌龟喝完后，果然立刻加速离开了酒吧。

一只兔子坐在吧台上目睹了这一切，它冲着酒保说：“哇，这只乌龟厉害得让我想起了那个古老的寓言故事。看来我还得继续努力锻炼才行。”

酒保笑着回答：“别担心，兔子。这只乌龟能喝酒变快，说明它是真的‘慢中求快’。”

assistant: 有一天，一只蚂蚁在树林里行走，突然看到一只大象正站在它前面，大象两眼流泪。

蚂蚁好奇地走上前，问：“大象，你怎么了？为什么哭了？”

大象抽泣着回答：“我被一群小孩子取笑了，他们说我太胖了，我很伤心。”

蚂蚁安慰大象：“别难过，大象。你知道吗？我们每个人都有自己的优点和缺点。你虽然体型庞大，但却是森林里力量最强大的动物。”

大象听了蚂蚁的话，感觉稍微好了一点。

这时，蚂蚁笑着补充道：“而且，你得想想，这么大的身躯，至少让我们这些小动物有个遮风挡雨的地方呢！”

大象也忍不住笑了起来，对蚂蚁说：“谢谢你，蚂蚁。我突然觉得自己胖得有点可爱了！”

assistant: 有一天，老鹰和猫头鹰在树林里碰到了对方。猫头鹰显得很傲慢，对老鹰说：“你知道吗？我是智慧的象征。大家都觉得我很聪明，你怎么样？”

老鹰不以为然，回答：“哼，我可是天空之王，速度和力量无人能敌。智慧又怎样？我们还是看谁先抓到一只老鼠吧！”

猫头鹰同意了，两者开始了比赛。在他们四处寻找老鼠的过程中，一只狡猾的狐狸看到了这一幕。

狐狸决定捉弄这两只鸟，于是它跑去找了一只木制的老鼠模型，放在了草地上。

老鹰和猫头鹰同时发现了这只“老鼠”，立刻从天空俯冲下来。然而，当他们试图抓住它时，才发现这只老鼠其实是个假的。

两只鸟愣住了，互相看着对方，突然放声大笑。

老鹰说：“原来我们都被狐狸捉弄了，看来力量和智慧都不够，还需要学会‘眼观四路，耳听八方’呢。”

从那以后，老鹰和猫头鹰成了好朋友，经常一起在森林里巡游，互相学习对方的优点。而狐狸则成了他们茶余饭后的谈资，每当想起这件事，他们都会哈哈大笑。
