Last month [Rupert Murdoch](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/style/rupert-murdoch-engaged-ann-lesley-smith.html) presented an engagement ring to Ann Lesley Smith, a 66-year-old former dental hygienist whom he had met last year at his vineyard in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles. A little over two weeks later, the wedding has been canceled.\
上个月，鲁珀特·默多克向安·莱斯利·史密斯赠送了一枚订婚戒指。安·莱斯利·史密斯是一位66岁的前牙科卫生师，他们去年在洛杉矶贝尔艾尔地区的葡萄园相识。两周多一点后，婚礼被取消了。

A spokesman for Mr. Murdoch declined to comment Tuesday. A person close to him, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share details concerning a personal matter, acknowledged that the planned summer wedding had been called off, adding that it would not be a “great leap” to say that Mr. Murdoch’s relationship with Ms. Smith had come to an end. The wedding would have been the media magnate's fifth trip down the aisle and Ms. Smith’s fourth.\
默多克先生的发言人周二拒绝发表评论。一位匿名人士透露，计划中的夏季婚礼已经取消，他表示这并不是一个“巨大的飞跃”来说默多克先生与史密斯女士的关系已经结束。这场婚礼本将是这位媒体大亨的第五次婚姻，史密斯女士的第四次。

Mr. Murdoch, 92, [made the engagement public](https://nypost.com/2023/03/20/rupert-murdoch-engaged-to-ann-lesley-smith/) last month through [Cindy Adams](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/style/cindy-adams-ny-post-only-in-new-york-kids-showtime-documentary-gossip.html), the veteran gossip columnist at one of the many newspapers he owns, The New York Post. After reporting that Mr. Murdoch had presented Ms. Smith with a diamond engagement ring in New York on St. Patrick’s Day, the columnist included a comment from her boss: “I dreaded falling in love — but I knew this would be my last,” he said. “It better be. I’m happy.”\
默多克先生，92岁，上个月通过他所拥有的众多报纸之一《纽约邮报》的资深八卦专栏作家辛迪·亚当斯公开了这段订婚消息。在报道默多克先生在圣帕特里克节在纽约向史密斯女士赠送了一枚钻石订婚戒指后，这位专栏作家还引用了她的老板的评论：“我曾经害怕坠入爱河，但我知道这将是我最后一次。”他说：“这最好是最后一次。我很幸福。”

In the days after the engagement, details began to emerge about Ms. Smith, who was born Ann Krohn and attended high school in Petaluma, Calif. Efforts to reach Ms. Smith by phone and via social media were unsuccessful, and she did not immediately reply to a message passed to her by a worker on her property in Escalon, Calif.\
在订婚后的几天里，有关史密斯女士的细节开始浮出水面。她原名安·克罗恩，曾在加利福尼亚州佩塔卢马市上高中。通过电话和社交媒体联系史密斯女士的努力都没有成功，她也没有立即回复一位在她位于加利福尼亚州埃斯卡隆的财产上工作的工人传递给她的信息。

In her 20s, while working as a dental hygienist in the Bay Area, Ms. Smith met John B. Huntington, a California railroad heir nearly 20 years her senior. During their marriage, which lasted from 1985 to 1989, she spent lavishly on clothes, rode horses and did charity work, she said in [a 2013 interview](https://www2.cbn.com/article/not-selected/riches-rags-redemption-salvation-ann-lesley-smith) with the Christian Broadcasting Network. “Money was no object,” she said. “I had everything in the world.”\
在20多岁时，史密斯女士在湾区担任牙科卫生师时，遇到了约翰·B·亨廷顿，加利福尼亚铁路继承人，比她大近20岁。在他们的婚姻中，持续了从1985年到1989年，她在2013年接受基督教广播网采访时表示，她挥霍地购买衣服，骑马并从事慈善工作。“金钱不是问题，”她说。“我拥有世界上的一切。”

In 1988, she was involved in an imbroglio at a society gala on the dance floor of the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Reuters described the melee as “a shoving match between two San Francisco socialites,” Ann K. Huntington (as Ms. Smith was then known) and another guest, Avelina Pritchard. “She pulled my hair,” Ms. Pritchard said in an interview for this article. “She scratched me.” Ms. Smith pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault and was ordered to donate $3,000 to a shelter for abused women, Reuters reported at the time.\
1988年，她卷入了旧金山费尔蒙特酒店社交晚会上的一场纷争。路透社将这场混战描述为“两位旧金山社交名流之间的推搡战”，当时的安·K·亨廷顿（当时的史密斯女士）和另一位客人阿维琳娜·普里查德之间的推搡战。普里查德女士在接受本文采访时说：“她拉我的头发，她抓伤了我。”据路透社报道，史密斯女士对轻罪袭击行为不予辩护，并被命令捐款3000美元给一个收容受虐妇女的庇护所。

In the interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Ms. Smith claimed that, after her marriage to Mr. Huntington, she had no place to live and had become suicidal because of a stingy prenuptial agreement.\
在接受基督教广播网采访时，史密斯女士声称，在与亨廷顿先生结婚后，她无处可住，并因为一份吝啬的婚前协议而陷入自杀的境地。

While pressing for greater financial support in court, she alleged that her former husband had been physically abusive. [Court documents](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1778112.html) from the case show that three mental health experts testified on Ms. Smith’s behalf, saying that the marriage had left her with post-traumatic stress disorder, rendering her unable to work. But a psychiatrist who treated Ms. Smith in the late 1980s disputed that assessment in his testimony, according to the court documents.\
在法庭上争取更多的经济支持时，她声称她的前夫曾经有过身体虐待行为。该案件的法庭文件显示，三名心理健康专家作证支持史密斯女士的说法，称这段婚姻给她留下了创伤后应激障碍，使她无法工作。但根据法庭文件，一位在1980年代末治疗过史密斯女士的精神科医生在他的证词中对这一评估提出了异议。

Ms. Smith’s life began to turn around when she became a Christian, she told the network, adding that she had started doing volunteer work as a chaplain for police departments in Marin County. In 1999, she wed Michael Carabello, a former percussionist in the rock band Santana. The fact of that marriage, which lasted about a year, did not appear in the spate of reports published in the wake of her engagement to Mr. Murdoch.\
史密斯女士告诉媒体，她的生活在成为基督徒后开始好转，她还开始在马林县的警察局担任牧师志愿者工作。1999年，她与前摇滚乐队Santana的打击乐手迈克尔·卡拉贝洛结婚。这段婚姻持续了大约一年，但在她与默多克先生订婚后的一系列报道中并未提及。

Her third marriage was to [Chester Smith](http://www.historicmodesto.com/People/Chester%20Smith/chestersmith.html), a radio and television entrepreneur in Modesto, Calif., who had started out as a disc jockey and country singer. Ms. Smith appeared at his side on the cover of “Captured by Love,” a 2005 album credited to “Chester Smith with Ann Lesley Smith.” In the photo, Mr. Smith is holding a guitar and has one foot on the fender of a Rolls-Royce. Ms. Smith is dressed in a police uniform with a priest’s collar, her hand on her husband’s shoulder.\
她的第三次婚姻是与切斯特·史密斯（Chester Smith）结婚，他是加利福尼亚州莫德斯托市的一位广播和电视企业家，起初是一名唱片骑师和乡村歌手。史密斯女士出现在他的身边，出现在2005年专辑《被爱所俘获》（Captured by Love）的封面上，该专辑署名为“切斯特·史密斯与安·莱斯利·史密斯”（Chester Smith with Ann Lesley Smith）。照片中，史密斯先生拿着一把吉他，一只脚踩在一辆劳斯莱斯的挡泥板上。史密斯女士穿着警察制服，戴着牧师的领子，手放在丈夫的肩膀上。

At the time of their meeting, Mr. Smith had been married to his first wife, Naomi Smith, for more than four decades. Together they had built his radio and television business into a mini-empire that included stations in California and Oregon. One of their three daughters, Lorna Scott-Smith, said she had not been invited to her father’s wedding to his second wife. “I never met her,” Ms. Scott-Smith said in an interview.\
在他们相遇的时候，史密斯先生已经与他的第一任妻子娜奥米·史密斯结婚了四十多年。他们共同将他的广播电视业务发展成了一个包括加利福尼亚和俄勒冈州的电台在内的小型帝国。他们的三个女儿之一，洛娜·斯科特-史密斯说她没有被邀请参加她父亲与第二任妻子的婚礼。“我从未见过她，”斯科特-史密斯女士在一次采访中说道。

After Mr. Smith died at age 78 in 2008, another of Mr. Smith’s daughters, Roxanne Storey, sued Ann Lesley Smith in San Joaquin County Superior Court. She alleged that Ms. Smith, the trustee of his estate, had failed to give her and her sisters their fair share of the inheritance.\
史密斯先生于2008年去世，享年78岁。之后，史密斯先生的另一位女儿罗克珊妮·斯托里在圣华金县高级法院起诉安·莱斯利·史密斯。她声称，作为遗产受托人的史密斯女士未能公平地给予她和她的姐妹们他们应得的遗产份额。

The case was settled out of court after Judge Duane Martin admonished Ms. Smith in a ruling, writing that “the court has lost all confidence in her ability to administer the trust other than for her own benefit, in conflict with her fiduciary duty to Chester Smith’s three daughters.”\
在法官杜安·马丁责令史密斯女士之后，该案在庭外达成和解。马丁法官在裁决中写道：“法庭对她管理信托的能力已经失去了所有信心，她违背了对切斯特·史密斯的三个女儿的受托责任，只为了自己的利益。”

Mr. Murdoch’s broken engagement comes at a time when he is embroiled in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against two of his companies, Fox Corporation and Fox News. Last week, a judge in Delaware Superior Court ruled that the [case was strong enough](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/business/fox-dominion-defamation-case.html) to go to trial.\
默多克先生的订婚破裂发生在他卷入一起价值16亿美元的诽谤诉讼之际，该诉讼由Dominion投票系统公司对他的两家公司——福克斯公司和福克斯新闻提起。上周，特拉华州高级法院的一位法官裁定该案足够强大，可以进行审判。

Mr. Murdoch’s [fourth marriage](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/business/media/rupert-murdoch-divorce-jerry-hall.html), to the actress and model Jerry Hall, ended in divorce last summer after six years.\
默多克先生的第四次婚姻与女演员和模特杰瑞·霍尔于去年夏天结束，持续了六年。
