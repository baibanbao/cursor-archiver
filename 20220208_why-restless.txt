- 我们为何都如此躁动不安？

- 书评：本杰明·斯托里和珍娜·西尔伯·斯托里的《我们为什么躁动》


- Few writers can capture the spirit of a society in a single paragraph. Even fewer can do it in ways that remain painfully insightful 200 years later. That is what makes Alexis de Tocqueville’s comment on the United States in the 1830s so striking:

- 能在一个段落中抓住一个社会时代精神的作家是罕见的，能够做到这一点并且在 200 年后仍然提供良药苦口的洞见的作家，更如凤毛麟角。这就是为什么阿列克西·德·托克维尔关于 19 世纪 30 年代美国的评论如此引人注目。

- It is a strange thing to see with what sort of feverish ardour Americans pursue well-being and how they show themselves constantly tormented by a vague fear of not having chosen the shortest route that can lead to it. The inhabitant of the United States attaches himself to the goods of this world as if he were assured of not dying, and he rushes so precipitately to grasp those that pass within his reach that one would say he fears at each instant he will cease to live before he has enjoyed them. He grasps them all but without clutching them, and he soon allows them to escape from his hands so as to run after new enjoyments. . . . Death finally comes, and it stops him before he has grown weary of this useless pursuit of a complete felicity that always flees from him. (511–14)

- 看看美国人追求幸福的狂热程度，看看他们如何不断地被一种模糊的恐惧折磨着，害怕自己没有选择捷径来实现幸福，是一件很奇怪的事情。美国人把自己和这个世界的美好联系在一起，就好像他相信自己不会死一样，而且他急于抓住那些唾手可得的东西，以至于人们会说，他每时每刻都担心自己在享受这些东西之前就不活了。他抓住了所有的东西，但没有抓住它们，他很快让它们从他的手中逃脱，以便追求新的享受……死亡终于来了，在他厌倦了这种对完美幸福的徒劳追求之前，死亡终于阻止了他。(511-14)

- The restlessness of Americans fascinated Tocqueville. This vast continent of abundance, in which virtually everyone seemed to be middle class, was nevertheless characterized by a feverish, impatient, anxious, tormented, and grasping spirit. It was as if consumption did not actually bring contentment, as many confidently assumed that it would, and riches did not bring rest. Two centuries on, Tocqueville’s diagnosis still applies—and not just in America, but throughout the Western world.

- 美国人的躁动不安分让托克维尔着迷。在这片广袤富饶的大陆上，几乎每个人都是中产阶级，然而却有一种狂热、急躁、焦虑、煎熬和抓狂的精神特质。就好像消费并没有带来满足感，如同许多人自信地认为的那样，而财富并没有带来安宁。两个世纪过去了，托克维尔的诊断仍然适用——不仅对美国，而且对整个西方世界而言，都是如此。

- That observation is at the heart of Benjamin Storey and Jenna Silber Storey’s wonderful new book, Why We Are Restless: On the Modern Quest for Contentment. It’s a remarkable piece of apologetics, not least because the authors never quite put their apologetic (or even Christian) cards on the table. Beautifully written and carefully argued, it’s as searching as it is subtle.

- 这种观察构成了本杰明·斯托里和珍娜·西尔伯·斯托里精彩的新书《我们为什么躁动：论现代人对满足的追求》的核心。这是一部出色的护教论著，尤其是因为作者并没大张旗鼓地护教（包括基督教）。文笔优美，论证细致，既微妙又具有探索性。

- We live in an age of unprecedented prosperity, yet everywhere we see signs that our pursuit of happiness has proven fruitless. Dissatisfied, we seek change for the sake of change―even if it means undermining the foundations of our common life. In Why We Are Restless, Benjamin and Jenna Storey offer a profound and beautiful reflection on the roots of this malaise and examine how we might begin to cure ourselves.

- 买买买

- 我们生活在一个前所未有的繁荣时代，然而我们在各处看到的迹象表明，我们对幸福的追求已证明是徒劳的。我们不满足，为了改变而寻求改变——即使这意味着破坏我们共同生活的基础。在《我们为什么躁动不安》一书中，本杰明和詹娜 · 斯托里对这种不安的根源进行了深刻而美好的反思，并研究了我们如何开始治愈自己。



- Drawing on the insights of Montaigne, Pascal, Rousseau, and Tocqueville, Why We Are Restless explores the modern vision of happiness that leads us on, and the disquiet that follows it like a lengthening shadow. In the sixteenth century, Montaigne articulated an original vision of human life that inspired people to see themselves as individuals dedicated to seeking contentment in the here and now, but Pascal argued that we cannot find happiness through pleasant self-seeking, only anguished God-seeking. Rousseau later tried and failed to rescue Montaigne’s worldliness from Pascal’s attack. Steeped in these debates, Tocqueville visited the United States in 1831 and, observing a people “restless in the midst of their well-being,” discovered what happens when an entire nation seeks worldly contentment―and finds mostly discontent.

借鉴蒙田、帕斯卡尔、卢梭和托克维尔的见解，《我们为什么躁动不安》探索了引导我们前进的现代幸福观，以及如影随形的不安。在 16 世纪，蒙田阐述了一个关于人类生活的原始愿景，启发人们把自己看作是在此时此地寻求满足的个体，但帕斯卡认为，我们若想找到幸福，不能通过愉快地寻求自我，只能通过痛苦地寻求上帝。卢梭后来试图从帕斯卡的攻击中拯救蒙田的世俗主义，但失败了。沉浸在这些争论中的托克维尔于 1831 年访问了美国，观察到一个民族“在他们的幸福中躁动不安”，发现当整个民族寻求世俗的满足时会发生什么——大部分是不满的。


- Arguing that the philosophy we have inherited, despite pretending to let us live as we please, produces remarkably homogenous and unhappy lives, Why We Are Restless makes the case that finding true contentment requires rethinking our most basic assumptions about happiness.


他认为，我们所继承的哲学尽管假装让我们随心所欲地生活，却带来了明显的同质化和不快乐的生活，《我们为何躁动不安》指出，要找到真正的满足感，需要重新思考我们关于幸福的最基本假设。

（Contented Restlessness
心满意足的躁动不安

- Using the work of four French writers—Montaigne (16th century), Pascal (17th), Rousseau (18th), and Tocqueville (19th)—the Storeys (both professors at Furman University) examine the ways in which human beings try to find rest and happiness and why so many of them end in failure.

- 通过法国作家蒙田（16 世纪）、帕斯卡（17 世纪）、卢梭（18 世纪）和托克维尔（19 世纪）的作品，斯托里斯夫妇（都是傅尔曼大学的教授）研究了人类寻求安息和幸福的方式，以及为什么这么多人以失败告终。

- Restlessness, the Storeys argue, pervades American life. You can see it everywhere: “in our love for the screen, with its diversions and distractions; in our demand for endless variety in what we eat, drink and wear; in our appetite for mind-altering substances, from pot to Prozac to Pinot Grigio; in our fascination with crises in almost every area of human life” (x–xi). Curiously, they note, restlessness seems to increase with privilege rather than the reverse. The modern middle class, as Tocqueville put it, is “restless in the midst of their well-being.”

斯特里斯夫妇认为，躁动不安充斥着美国人的生活。你可以在任何地方看到它：“在我们对电子屏幕的热爱中，在屏幕带来的移情和干扰中；在我们对饮食和穿着的无穷多样性的需求中；在我们对改变精神的物质的胃口中，从大麻到百忧解 (Prozac) 再到灰皮诺葡萄酒 (Pinot Grigio) ; 在我们对人类生活几乎每个领域的危机的迷恋中”(x-xi)。奇怪的是，他们指出，躁动似乎随着特权而增加，而不是相反。正如托克维尔所说，现代中产阶级“在他们的幸福中躁动不安”。


- But why? Where does this sense of peaceless unease come from? And what can be done about it?

但是为什么呢？这种没有和平的不安感从何而来？我们能做些什么呢？

- Four Important Thinkers

- For Michel de Montaigne (1533–92), our problem is simply that we’re too concerned with what lies beyond ourselves. Rather than searching for meaning outside of our natural lives—in religion, virtue, honor, knowledge, or whatever—we need to learn instead to practice immanent contentment. The key to happiness lies in simply being at home in oneself and the world: it’s the pursuit of “mere life, life for its own sake, life without the orienting norms of philosophy, politics or faith” (22). Today we might describe it using language like “being present” or “mindfulness.” Happiness is here, not in a world beyond, and we can find it by practicing the right way of life, “oriented by the quest for immanent contentment, for psychic equilibrium in our inner lives and unmediated approbation in our social lives” (48).


四位重要的思想家

对于米歇尔·蒙田（1533-92）来说，我们的问题仅仅在于我们过于关注自身之外的东西。与其在我们的自然生活之外寻找意义 -- 宗教、美德、荣誉、知识或其他什么 -- 不如学习实践内在的满足感。幸福的关键在于简单地把握自己和世界，追求“仅仅是生活，为了生活而生活，没有哲学、政治或信仰的定向规范的生活”(22)。今天，我们可能用 "活在当下 "或 "正念 "这样的语言来描述它。幸福就在这里，而不是在另一个世界，我们可以通过实践正确的生活方式来找到它，"以追求内在的满足感为导向，在我们的内在生活中追求心理平衡，在我们的社会生活中z寻求直接的认可" (48)。


- To which Blaise Pascal (1623–62), in a nutshell, says: bunk. For Pascal, Montaigne has dramatically understated the problem. He’s accepted trivial and fleeting pleasures as a substitute for real joy, which gets us nowhere, and his proposal is essentially naive. Human beings don’t want platitudes and deflection and a smattering of diversions to keep us distracted; we want truth, and justice, and love, and eternity, and ultimately God.

对此，布莱斯 · 帕斯卡 (1623-62)的回答 简而言之就是：胡扯。对帕斯卡而言，蒙田严重低估了这个问题。蒙田接受琐碎和短暂的快乐作为真正喜乐的替代品，这让我们无处可去，他的建议本质上是天真的。人类不需要陈词滥调、偏离主题和一些消遣来分散我们的注意力；我们需要真理、正义、爱、永恒，以及最终极的上帝。


- But we are ignorant, finite, and destined for death. And that means that without the grace of God we’ll be miserable: “Our consciousness of our own mortality and our awareness of our own ignorance make us unhappy. . . . No psychic equilibrium is possible for a being whose desires so radically outstrip his possibilities. Misery follows ineluctably from an honest estimate of the gap between what we want and what we are” (66). We have a deeper problem than Montaigne admits, and we need a deeper solution. Thus Pascal, though he seems more pessimistic than Montaigne, actually seeks a far richer sort of joy and refuses to settle for anything less. This joy, he concludes, can only be found in Christ.

但是我们是无知的，有限的，注定要死亡的。这意味着，如果没有上帝的恩典，我们会很痛苦：“我们对自己必死的意识，以及对自己无知的意识，让我们不快乐……一个人的欲望如此彻底地超出了他的可能性，他不可能取得心理上的平衡。只要对我们想要和我们是什么之间落差做一个诚实的估计,痛苦就是不可避免的。”(66)我们有一个比蒙田承认的更深层次的问题，我们需要一个更深层次的解决方案。因此，尽管帕斯卡看起来比蒙田更加悲观，但实际上他寻求的是一种更加丰富的快乐，并且拒绝接受任何少于这种快乐的东西。他总结道，这种喜乐只能在基督里找到。

- Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–78) recognizes that Pascal is onto something—the socialites and philosophes of 18th century Paris are indeed secretly miserable—but he wants to solve the problem a different way. “For Pascal,” the Storeys explain, “we are unhappy because we are alienated from God. For Rousseau, we are unhappy because we are alienated from ourselves. For Pascal, nature is fallen but can be redeemed by God. For Rousseau, man is fallen but can be redeemed by nature” (102). Thus begins a quest to find wholeness by going “all in” on something: solitude, society, citizenship, individualism, education, family. Rousseau pursues each one and finds the contentment he craves to be a mirage every time. His friendships collapse, his family life is a disaster, his experiments in citizenship and education fail; even solitude does not bring him rest.

让-雅克·卢梭 (1712-78) 认识到帕斯卡说到点子上了ーー18 世纪巴黎的社会名流和哲学家们确实暗自痛苦ーー但他想用不同的方式解决问题。“对帕斯卡来说，”斯托里斯解释说，“我们不快乐是因为我们与上帝疏远了。对卢梭来说，我们不快乐是因为我们与自己疏远了。对帕斯卡来说，自然已然堕落，但是上帝可以拯救它。对卢梭来说，人类虽然堕落了，但是可以被自然所救赎”(102)。因此，人们开始通过“全身心投入”某些事物来寻求完整性：孤独、社会、公民身份、个人主义、教育、家庭。卢梭追求每一样东西,却发现他所渴望的满足感每次都是一种幻觉。他的友谊崩溃了，他的家庭生活是一场灾难，他在公民权和教育方面的实验失败了；甚至孤独也没有给他带来安宁。



- [Pascal] seeks a far richer sort of joy and refuses to settle for anything less. This joy, he concludes, can only be found in Christ.

- 【帕斯卡】寻求一种更加丰富的快乐，并拒绝满足于其他任何东西。他总结道，这种喜乐只能在基督里找到。

- 帕斯卡尔寻求一种更丰富的快乐，并拒绝以其他任何东西为满足。他的结论是，这种快乐只有在基督里才能找到。

- But there are lessons to learn from his failures. “Rousseau is like a chemist in a laboratory whose daring combinations of elements have blown up in his face: the experiment kills its author but leaves a telling residue in his beakers” (139). It’s a tragic but instructive legacy. “The modern quest for immanent contentment is destined to leave us as restless as ever, no matter how wholeheartedly we give ourselves to it” (139).

但是，他的失败中也有值得我们学习的地方。“卢梭就像实验室里的化学家，其大胆的元素组合在他脸上炸开了花：这个实验杀死了它的始作俑者，却在他的烧杯里留下了明显的残留物”(139)。这是一个悲惨但有教育意义的遗产。“现代人对内在满足的追求注定会让我们一如既往地坐立不安，无论我们多么全心全意地投入其中”(139)。


- Which takes us back to Tocqueville (1805–59) and his analysis of American restlessness. Tocqueville, like Pascal, suspects that a turbulent unease lies beneath all the Montaignesque talk of prosperity—to say nothing of equality, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—and the greater the prosperity, the greater the restlessness. His writings are an attempt to teach Americans “the Pascalian lesson that the goods that are their treasure, the justice that is their pride, and the happiness that is their aim can never be enough for a human soul” (144).

这让我们回到了托克维尔(1805-59) 和他对美国人躁动不安的分析。托克维尔和帕斯卡尔一样，怀疑在所有蒙田式的繁荣论之下潜藏着一种动荡不安ーー更不用说平等、自由和追求幸福ーー而且繁荣越大，不安越大。他的作品试图向美国人传授“帕斯卡式的教训，即他们的财富、他们的骄傲、他们的目标——幸福永远不能满足一个人的灵魂”(144)。

- It’s a tough sell. Americans, like the modern West in general, are inclined to see the world in immanent, material terms, which makes it harder to believe in the soul and harder to ask deep questions about meaning, spirituality, and transcendence. But that’s exactly the problem. “Without self-knowledge to guide it, the quest for the good life becomes a slapdash sequence of locations, vocations and vacations” (163).

这是一次艰难的推销。美国人，就像现代西方人一样，倾向于用内在的、物质的方式来看待世界，这使得人们更难相信灵魂，也更难提出关于意义、精神性和超越性的深刻问题。但这正是问题所在。“没有自知之明的引导，对美好生活的追求就会变成一系列匆忙的地点、职业和假期”(163)。

- Inevitable Restlessness

- Why We Are Restless is a book of exposition, not exhortation. There are no next steps, no knockdown arguments, and no points of application. It does a magnificent job of summarizing four hugely important thinkers with impressive clarity, wit, and brevity and raises some profound questions about the modern quest for happiness in the process. But it’s not a practical guide for how to respond. As such, it’s only fair to say that it wouldn’t be everybody’s cup of tea.

不可避免的躁动
《我们为何躁动不安》是一本阐述而非劝勉的书。没有接下来怎么办，没有雄辩的论据，也没有具体的应用。它以令人印象深刻的清晰、机智和简洁，出色地总结了四位重要思想家的观点，并提出了一些关于现代追求幸福的深刻问题。但这并不是一本教人如何应对的实用指南。因此，公平地说，它并不是每个人都喜欢的那杯茶。


- In my view, however, the Storeys have put their finger on something of tremendous significance for evangelism and apologetics in the post-Christian West. In a flat world, where transcendence has been lost and everything is immanent, restlessness is inevitable. As they explain,

然而，在我看来，在后基督教的西方，斯托里斯夫妇指出了一些对福音传道和护教具有重大意义的东西。在一个越来越平的世界里，超越已经消逝，一切都是内在的，躁动不安是不可避免的。正如他们解释的那样：


- Pascal reveals the misery that haunts the quest for immanent contentment like a shadow. That misery—carefully hidden but constantly revealed in the love of diversion so characteristic of modern men and women—is the enduring sign of the mismatch between the kind of happiness we pursue and the kind of beings we are. (178, emphasis added)

帕斯卡尔揭示了像阴影一样困扰着寻求内在满足的痛苦。这种痛苦——小心翼翼地隐藏在现代男女特有的消遣爱好中，却不断地暴露出来——是我们所追求的幸福与我们是什么样的人之间不匹配的持久标志。（178，重点为笔者所加）

- But that, of course, presents a powerful opportunity for anyone who is Augustinian enough to see it: “For you made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you.”

但是，这当然对任何一个具有足够奥古斯丁精神的人来说，都是一个极好的机会，让他开声说：“主啊，你为你自己创造了我们，我们的心永不安宁，直到在你身上得到安息。”
