The core problem is it is a negative sum game. Miners pay for electricity with real money so there is a house rake. All “earnings” beyond that are just redistribution of new money. It’s very much like a pyramid scheme.

Most investments generate cash. Crypto bleeds it. That is the deepest flaw, and there is no way out of that.

核心问题是它是一个负和游戏。矿工用真金白银支付电费，所以有一个房子的耙子。除此之外的所有 "收益 "都是新钱的再分配。这很像一个金字塔计划。

大多数投资产生现金。而加密货币却在流血。这是最深的缺陷，而且没有办法摆脱。
