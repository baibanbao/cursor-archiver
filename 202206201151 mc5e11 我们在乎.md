- 宋丹丹的第二段婚姻的丈夫的其实宋丹丹第三段婚姻，宋丹丹这个人很有意思，她年轻时候其实是很漂亮，现在也能看出您是生活漂亮。她就是她闪婚结婚结得特别快，她曾经有个男朋友，可能她受了她的伤害，跟男朋友分手之后，她马上就审核还生下一个孩子。生了孩子之后，但是并没有带来幸福。就是她就她就这个离婚了，离婚之后嫁给了英达，跟英达一起十几年，然后后来她就又跟英达离婚了，嫁给了这个北京。
- 北京这个首钢集团的老大姓赵什么玩意忘了，但这个她的账，她的丈夫这个赵先生，她结婚的时候就自带了一个女儿，就带了和前妻的女儿，就是这个赵婷。所以这个宋丹丹是赵婷的异母吧，在后妈她的后妈。而赵婷其实也就是从小就送到美国去读书了，所以他受的是美国文化的熏陶。
- 当然她是个亚裔的女性，所以她的很多视角肯定都是女性的视角，这个无一之地，这本书也很有意思，它其实是根据一个纪实文学改的纪实作品，这个作者也是个女的，她叫杰西卡什么了？她这个去在美国各地采访这个美国的新的游牧民族，美国怎么会有游牧民族呢？就是因为很多中产阶级到了这个中年或者老年之后，突然家庭遭遇变故就破产了。这种情况。很多破产的结果就是使他们失去了自己的房子，有的还失去了这个退休金。总之他们就没法在一个地方固定地生活了，因为房租很贵，这个吃穿用度的费用很贵，关键是找不到工作，这些人还需要工作。那怎么办呢？就有一些美国人主要是白人，他们就有组织或者无组织的就在路上飘买辆房车好一点的买个房车，差一点的就是买个普通的面包车或者就是一个大一点的轿车，然后他们就里边改装一下就上路了。
- 上路就是美国是不是没有过路费，我想确认一下，对，必须有必须这一点。如果是中国的话，这个这个路上开着比咱家还贵是吧，这个随便找个地方待着也比那便宜。美国是没有过路费的。所以他们在美国就像一群候鸟一样，从一个地方到另外一个地方去打工，打临时工。而且那个工种有比较好一点的工作，比如亚马逊每个月每年这个在圣诞季的时候会拿出一个月的时间来顾这些人，顾他们在他的那个亚马逊的工厂贴那个标签，年终发货就是在仓库里发货。但是亚马逊也不是什么慈善机构。哼亚马逊这么做的原因是因为亚马逊有减税政策，如果他雇用了这些，就是后这些没无家可归的人，或者是在临时工之后，政府会给他减 20% 还是多少的税，所以他们一算很合适。就每年雇一段时间。雇的时候，那个亚马逊包了一个大的停车场，然后这个停车场就是可以让这些房车的车主们都住在，那就是不收他停车费。所以这个电影一开场就是女主人公就是在那么一个停车场，在那个停车场里度日日，但是这个工作不设永久的，很快她们就又没工作了，没工作呢就又要开着上路。帮别人收甜菜、收棉花干农活都是很重的活。你知道这个农田里的活不是简单的，一般人都能干得了。所以这些人的生活还是很痛苦的，就是并没有那么浪漫，这个电影也没有把他们浪漫化。但是就是有这么一个问题，就是这些人我就看这个电影的时候也在想，就是为什么这个女主人公他愿意流浪，因为她明显她妹妹愿意收留他。另外一个她有个男朋友就不能剧透了就是他总有机会，安顿一下了，但是他都是拒绝了这样的机会。
- 就是也许有人说他是喜欢一个人的灵魂在路上其实不是那么简单，你知道寄人篱下总是不好，不管住在谁家，因他对，就是我们应该理解他这种心态，既然还能上路，还有车还能开车还油钱还加得起，又不收过路费的话，那么开着上路还是可以理解的一个选择啊。无稽之地拍得特别美，就是它的他基本上他的摄影是摄影是一局。他的摄影拍得非常美，现在很少见到拍得这么美的电影，而且他大部分时间是在黄昏的时分，利用这个黄昏的那个就是落日余晖下去之后那段很宝贵的短暂时光。用那个时间段来拍摄。那我们现在给大家看一个看一小段镜头，因为我觉得这是这个电影可以截成预告片的那一部分。更多的还是要大家 4 月 23 号到 4 月 23 号去电影院看比较好。那对这个电影也比较公平，我们就看这样一个片段。
- 就是大家看这个构图，这个镜头我觉得特别美，提一个灯，而且他一定要穿个白的裙子，否则的话那个灯光是透不过来的，穿个黑裙子，那没人看得见，先先在他的右手再交到左手。就这这个这个意境特别好。那我们这个片子就请大家自己去电影院去看，这个很难得有这样的机会。
- 我们现在要吐槽的是另外一部电影，就是最佳女主角，因为这次最佳喜剧类的女主角喜剧类这个金球奖它是分喜剧和剧情类，它是不一样的，这个剧情类的男主角是没有争议的。这个布拉特我也建议大家看看这个电影。这个电影非常挑战人的三观，他不是杜撰了一个跟哈萨克斯坦名字就差一个字母的国家。然后这个男主人公就是他他到了美国，就是为了为了取为了这个，因为他们的总统就是没法跟特朗普交上朋友，看着金正恩都交上朋友了，总统就显得非常落寞，说派你个任务去勾结他们的勾，勾搭他们的总统或者副总统，最好把彭斯也给右上勾，让他们成为我们的好朋友。
- 他带着这样的使命，就领着自己的闺女，她的女儿只有 15 岁就到了美国。这个片子非常讽刺，他到了美国之后这个没见着彭斯，这是这个电影的一大遗憾。但是见到那个朱丽安妮就是那个特朗普的历史。然后这个电影在拍的时候，它是完全按照这个纪录片拍的，这个拍法也是很诡异，他按纪录片拍，就是所有的演员据说是都签了一个协议。这个协议就是使你这个我我拍你的所有镜头我都可以用在任何一个地方，就是你不能发生任何争议，所以。
- 这就是这有一个神经喜剧。
- 然后关键是这里边就让她的闺女就让那个女演员 15 岁的那个女演员化妆成一个女记者，去找了朱丽安妮，然后假装去拍这个电视片。朱丽安妮不知道，就以为是来了个真的女记者，就开始这个女的就进了他房间，然后就发生了不可描述的这种行为，而且都拍下来了，这个并且用到了这部电影里。所以这个这个男主这个男主觉得太神了，这个片子建议大家看一看，非常非常神经。
- 但是就是这个喜剧类的女主角其实是挺有争议的。因为这一次金球奖的最大赢家其实都是这个网络的在线平台。就流媒体平台在这个流媒体平台里做的最大的是 NE 菲又叫网菲， Netflix Netflix 呢，它这个这一次一共金秋剪，一共有这个电影是 70 部，70个单项奖，这个奈飞就得了 22 个单项提名，他有 50 多个电视奖，54个大概是他又得了 20 个这个电视，电视的提名也就等于说它占了1/3，所有的这个获奖类获奖类的内容它都占了1/3，这个比例已经相当大了。
- 那 Netflix 现在在全球，它他的这个地位越来越高，就是因为他有的是钱，他给这个别人很多资金，然后他他拍了他自己每个礼拜都会上新一部新的戏。这个其中他天天推的这个电影叫叫 icare lot 这个中文翻译成完美监护。这个片子有很多很多的槽点可以吐我。所以我们就先看一下我中间这个不重要的情节，我会给大家跳过去。但是大家先看。
- 看完之后，我们就分析一下这部电影他的问题在哪。就她出来之后好多人不服，就这个电影哪怕把女主角最她只给了一个最佳女主角的奖项，但大家觉得都不应该给她这个女主女女主角的主演要介绍一下大家有没有看过一个叫相识的爱人的一个电影对，就那个主角这个主角他的他有个他的英文名字是叫什么帕克。
- 但是他就告诉这个所有东方的记者都一定要叫它的中文名字，因为它对中国文化、对这个东方文化、神秘文化它有着执念，所以它就给自己起的名字叫裴纯华，所以大家都叫的裴春花。裴春花这个这部戏的演出大家可以待会再看再讨论。就是他演了一个彻底的恶女的形象，就是有史以来电影中很少能出现这么纯粹的一个恶女形象，大家可以看一下。
- Look at you sitting there you think your good people youre not good people trust me theres no such thing is good people i used to be like you thinking that were working hard and playing fair would lead to success and happiness it doesnt playing fair is a joke invented by rich people to keep the rest of us poor.

- 暂停在这只剩 26 分钟到这个电影还比较正常是吧，大家还觉得应该它的前期的建构还是不错的。这个故事的就是刚开始你会看到这个一个很邪恶的女人怎么侵吞这些无助的老年人的资产，尤其是这个老彼得森太太更加可怜，本来自己住得好的，就莫名其妙就被带走了。这个很像卡夫卡的那种审判，就一个人无缘无故就被别人带走，然后莫名其妙就被这个关了起来。然后接下来我们就是想这个故事该怎么发展。
- 我当时看这个电影的时候，我就问别人这个电影到底讲了能不能一句话告诉我这个电影讲了什么。他告诉我这是一个杀猪盘，是一个杀猪盘做局的人，最后被人反杀的故事。我想挺好，正义得到伸张，那接下来就是的坏蛋，它尽管很猖狂，但是正义的力量慢慢就会起来了。然后直到看到这个看到这就是你觉得非常这个心情已经很低落了，因为我们会对那个老太太的处境感同身受，然后也会觉得这个制度是这么的不公平，尤其是那个黑人法官如此的昏庸无能，我觉得这个电影还是挺大胆的，敢用一个黑人法官就是而这个女主角和他的搭档呢就为所欲为。
- 到这个电影应该是就是一般我们看到的电影都是这个构造的，就就是就是在为下一步这个好人的登场，正义的伸张，故事的发展都奠定了很好的基础。那接下来就是应该有一股跟她这个斗争的力量出现了，我们就想到底是出现一个好的律师，这个绝地逢生让老太太绝地逢生，还是老太太有个比如说远方的亲戚或者是私生的儿子能够救他一把这个时候都是所有的悬疑都在这里。所以我们接着往，接着往下看的话会跟你的想象完全不一样。

- 就他获得了最佳就是喜剧类、音乐喜剧类，它是属于一类，就是最佳女主角。
- 为什么喜剧最近他一点不喜剧。
- 你们觉得是喜剧吗？
- 是吗？不正经，正经也不搞怪。前面看着感觉很压抑。
- 其实挺压抑的。这片子看了很多人说，看了之后觉得这个女的杀死太便宜他了，这最后 30 秒 1 就挨了一枪而已。该下的罪恶是观众不能原谅的。我们就分析一下这个就是他的最大的问题，就是我问了所有喜看过这个电影的人都不喜欢这个电影。
- 我你喜欢他什么呢？
- 真的，那你说一说喜欢的理由。
- 那我们现在说我觉得没有他一个，就是他其实都写的这个那个。但他最终还是能够找回来。等于什么两个店都换了。她觉得最后能够你还是觉得这个是你看完的时候你没有，她确实是我觉得这个女的跟女。
- 但是你对于我你没有觉得骗子觉得这个是不应该的。根据时间高度支持他能够最后就是把那个最后能够回来，就是那个在前面出现第一个出现男人或者此生杀了他。即使对开始的一个就是录音，但是他又把这整个就是拒的这个觉得到最后要结尾的时候，并且想办法这个这又把他拉回到正方形，因为你不要说过，不过什么问题。其实人类社会就是这个价值观的这个正确的价值观。任何人你看这种，比如说有的人我在我们看起来很快，但她这个孩子也是善良。
- 最后让那个普通人杀死他本身是一些犯罪，绝对不是单纯的这种，简直就是他吃的他好像是好人已经吃屎了，他自己的手机这样非常难受，就遵从他一个好人拿枪打死他这个事情，虽然他是在帮他去是悲愤的情绪，现在这种事情本身是错的，怎么能达成另外一个不对，所以我现在不是搬回来，到时候问一下是不是我们讲剧本的时候那种直接到底后面再提现。如果那我想就是实在没办法了，我错误结局你感觉是那么一回事，但绝对不是请你直播。我还在，我还在我还在那个课程里面。
- 就这个就像是一个道具，这个电影如果要是放在喜剧片里面的话，那只能说它整个片子就是一个闹剧，肯定是你不行了，你可以对这种保安，那你让保安听电话，你让保安听电话，我现在回来也不要你跪着，你现在就把手机给搞完，谁是谁在送你。你你确保送担保，家里现在回来了吗？人群要求预测解决拒绝。小俊，你跟保安说一下，你跟保安说一下。好，我废话。
- 怎么现在有事。
- 这个电影我改天再说，我有另外一个角度给你们分享。我不觉得这是个差评，但是他只是故事性不好，但是社会性没事吗？那就没事了。
- 谁知道你是谁，但是这个名字我一下几个问题。
- 然后我们我们分析下这个电影，就是一般电影它都要有一个道德前提，这个道德前提就是让观众可以带入进去，无论他是好人还是坏人，坏人其实也无所谓的。教父里边全是坏人。但是我们能马上把自己带入进去，因为他们自己也讲道义，也讲亲情，对也讲这个礼仪廉耻这些东西。
- 但是问题就在于说你这个人类的道德底线在哪，这个底线就是不能欺负弱小，尤其是这个对于老年人来说，他已经是弱者，没法，这个生活自理能力很差。这个时候你把他的所有一切都给剥夺，并把他囚禁起来，这其实是观众很难和他发生共情，不可能跟他发生共情。对，因为这个时候如果再切换到这个女主视角的话，就是一个很大的问题，就是你怎么能让观众这么就是心里马上就扭转过来。
- 因为在这之前，我们都是站在这个彼得森太太这个这一面的，就是他代表的这股势力不管是小恶魔也好，俄罗斯黑帮也好，都觉得就是这是一股当然他做的东西做的事情也不合法，但这是一股在无奈的情况下对抗邪恶的力量，对抗这种崩溃的法官，对抗这个有漏洞的制度和利用这个漏洞的坏人，你觉得这是一条出路，结果它这条路走不通。
- 尤其是当我看这个电影的时候，我当看到这个要把它杀死，把它一下扔上了那个车，我以为这个事就解决了，但是一看还没死，不单是没死，我一看后边还剩 40 分钟，我就知道完蛋了。这个肯定他死不了，死了故事也就结束了。而且假如说我们就我们站在这个奈飞和编剧的角度，假如说就让他复仇成功，他其实是一个更平庸的故事是吧，其实也没啥意思。
- 不一定在这里。如果他停止，就是有点像是这个画人，他不是一个人，他是一类人，这个坏人死了，可能金融机构和这个机构我依然就是小恶魔，依然没有把他救出来。就这个话，然后另外一个后人站出来。
- 仍然这个体制继续帮他们搞到里面，就是这是个最大的问题。就是如果说我们让正义获胜的话，我们希望是正义按照用正义用合法的方式去获胜。所以他必然是有一个比如说名不见经传的历史，开始打官司，一层一层上诉，最后打到最高法院，终于战胜了这些坏法官也得到了惩罚，这个坏蛋也得到惩罚。然后不单，而且这个制度的漏洞还给修补上了。通过了一个彼得森法案，就是所有的以后老年人不能再被这样，就随随便便送到这个老人院了。这就是这是一类电影。而且这类电影里边有很多优秀的佳作，有一个电影叫永不妥协。
- 你们知道吧，就是茱莉亚罗伯茨演的索斯伯格的作品，那个索斯伯格他其实是一个艺术片导演，他还在同一时期他拍了法国贩毒网，那是个艺术片，但接着拍了个商业片，就那个片子就特别让人振奋人心。她的动机跟这个女人是一模一样的，就是朱丽雅罗伯茨在那演的跟单亲妈妈，她就是为了赚钱，他还找不到工作，他要赚钱，为了赚钱他不择一切手段，所以他才看上了这个就是当时是这个诉讼的一个环境，诉讼关系就告那个很那个铝厂好像是一个大的跨国企业，那个企业把他们家给污染了，然后这些居民就可以得到赔偿。
- 关键是这个朱利亚萝卜慈想拿到高额的这个就是办案经费，就是拿到这个高额的提成，他才去这样做。但是在做的过程中他慢慢良心付出，发现他自己做的不仅仅是为了自己挣钱，但这个电影闪光在就是最后当都朱利亚罗伯茨官司也打赢了这个正业得到伸张的时候，他这里边他最快乐的那一刻就是他拿到 15 万美元，我记得是拿到了 15 万美元的奖金，这个时候观众都跟他一起欢呼雀跃，因为毕竟大家都是俗人，是吧，你光让大家这个去讲奉献，但是拿不到任何利益，那也大家不高兴。
- 其实这个真正的问题不在于他喜欢不喜欢钱，喜欢钱是没问题的。就是但是你不能用这个故事，假如说不这样转一下的话，这个故事没法讲下去。你光用黑帮的手段好，你就是再派一会黑帮，再拍一会墨西哥黑帮，又把他给干掉了，然后对他进行残酷的酷刑折磨。比如说那不是没办法。
- 就把那个法官给拉进去。
- 一个法对，再把法官给揍一顿。然后这个法官给记住了，再把法官给删了也好，私信这叫私信人的位置。对。
- 然后让法官的关系网产生作用来做。
- 扭转一个句型，就是如果是私行的话，就有这么一个问题，就是它是违背人类法师精神的。另外一个就是美国有一些言语就是正义，不单是要这个不单要伸张，而且要在众目睽睽之下伸张阳光对，一定要在阳光下伸张。所以这个故事我们可以理解就是如果不用这种方式讲的话，这个故事就是更失败的一个故事，它现在在 imdb 和豆瓣都是 6.3 分，估计还会更低。对，他如是不用这个办法的话，他可能就是 4.3 分就更差，会更差。就是说他他前面这个设定一看你就知道他要想办法把他营救出来。
- 对，非常难得。对这。
- 所以我们这就要说一下这个奈飞他的机制。奈飞他是我们知道它是一个美国的一它最早是租录像贷的一个公司，然后靠录像贷这个赚了一些钱，然后开始他们就缔造自己的这个流媒体王国。现在奈飞的势力非常大，它拥有很多很多的，它全球 100 多个国家，它都可都开始这个有奈飞的平台。并且因为美国的市场是有限的，美国我们知道也就是它的整个市场没多大，就是美国人它可选择的地方很多。比如说除了奈飞之外，其实还有五大电视网，还有这么多好莱坞的制片公司。光这个流媒体就还有迪斯尼在线，迪斯尼加迪斯尼还把葫芦给收购了。其实迪斯尼也是很厉害的一个势力，苹果也有这个在线部门。但是苹果今年好像在金秀奖只有一项提名。
- 另外一个最大的竞争对手，虎视眈眈的对手是亚马逊，亚马逊也在做流媒体。所以他们加起来就是这几家都都在竞争，都在竞争。然后这个奈飞做得厉害，就是他完全是纯用互联网思维在做电影，就是他现在已经涵盖了各个领域，各个平台。这个类型，他会在做一部剧之前，他先寻找这个类型。我们就就说这一步了，他肯定是看了各种的这种犯罪题材的，就是这种这种这个伸张正义题材的这种电影。然后在这里边挑出一个框架，看看这样有没有人这么拍过，如果拍过他就不拍了，他基本上就不拍了，他肯定要另辟蹊径。最后选择这个方向，就是这个坏蛋获胜，但是坏蛋也不能让他真的获胜，最后还要让他倒个霉之类的。同时他可以说我在讽刺这个制度就是这个对，可以可以把这一切都赖在制度上。制度上面对，但其实是这个电影还是很失败的，即使你赖在制度上面，因为观众的心里是很微妙的。
- 哪怕在流媒体平台上看，大家喜欢看个爽片是吧？你看艺术看，除非你喜欢看艺术片，艺术片那是另外一批观众，你这个是既不艺术就又不让大家爽，弄得超级拧巴。对，这看完了，看完之后挺郁闷的。就是对，很难受。你说大家图啥呢？其实这个奈飞它很聪明。在奈飞之前，美国的电视剧都是一个礼拜播一集的都一季，它是一个礼拜播出来。但是奈飞他又开始把十几五到十几一起放出来，让大家一起看。其实奈飞这么干是非常有道理的，你知道为什么 5 至 10 级吗？他就算一下你周末的这个时间，就让一个人周末把它刷全刷完，就是两部复联的体量，就等于看了两部复联。然后这样的话其实就是他的观众就慢慢地都被他拉去了，就是大家这个整个的观影习惯也发生了改变，就是会会一气看完。看完之后而且他要形成口碑，再完成第二次的内容销售。所以这现在奈飞他有个推荐机制，就是他会把他认为好的片子推到那个客户的客户的。这个我给大家看一下，乃菲给我推的。
- 每个用户他会根据你的观影习惯，他会推荐给你很多片子，这个片子他是认为他已经掌握了这个观众口碑的奥秘，所以他但他他完全是用大数据，这些东西就是大数据，他玩得非常溜，就是他绝对是就是他会根据我看过的电影再推荐新的电影。然后如果你不喜欢他再推荐一批，而且他会因为你看过某一个电影，他在推荐一批跟这个类似的电影。对，但是这里边这个推荐的就有好有坏，而且人的口碑是很复杂的，并不是因为说他的得分高，我就一定要看。比如说这个今年今年这个金球奖最大的赢家王冠。 the cron 讲英国王室的一共五季，现在拍到第五季就是正好是戴安娜王妃那一季，所以他今年的也是最大的赢家就是他不但获了最佳电视剧，并且她的女主角也是他这个男主角也是她男主角是演查尔斯王子的那个演员，但是那其实对别的那个演员也就不公平。
- 今年的这个美国的电视剧是竞争很激烈的，就是我们看一下金球奖这个名单，金球奖这个名名单的电视类的最佳剧情，就是这个这个王冠王冠是获了最佳剧情，但是其实是也有一些很好的演员，就是这个他还有一种叫限定剧，就是一季播完的几集播完的就是又叫迷你剧，他的那个就是泰勒招爱后一期兵，后一期兵大家看了吗？我看了，这个是很值得一看的。
- 后羿骑兵的女主角获了最佳女主角，但这个最佳女配角就是这个吉林安德森吉林安德森获得最佳女配角。然后但其实他们这个竞争非常激烈，因为这个男主角其实是这个乔迟奥康纳得奖其实是有点不公平的，原因就在于这个今年的男主角其实有很多的很厉害的精兵强将，包括这个阿尔帕希诺。阿尔帕希诺就是叫富理的 M 演 Michael 的演员，像他这么老的一个老演员都这个去拍电视剧，这已经不容易了。而且他拍的还不错，叫纳粹猎人，结果他也没获奖，他也没获奖。然后还有一个叫法官大人，是那个就是绝命毒师的主演老白我们叫他老白，他演的那个片子也非常棒，最后还是给了这个奥康纳，所以王冠还是值得大家去看一看的。我就说大家有空去看一下王冠，但是不一定说非得看。假如说你根本就不喜欢这个英国历史，对他这个看见王氏这个东西就烦，那完全就可以不用看，你去看看你喜欢的历史剧就可以了。就是奈飞的问题，就是他会做一个很个性化的东西，但是这个性化的东西也是根据你的喜欢去定制的。但是他改变了这个电视剧和电影的这种以往的制作模式，比如说会他有自己的播出平台就好办了。
- 这个去年由于疫情本来这个美国就电影院都关门了，所以能播的也只有他这样的这种平台可以播，但是奈飞是进不了中国了，就是他已经不可能进入中国。就因为去前一年他拍了一个叫这个洗钱洗钱的这样一个就是剧情版的电视剧。然后里边讲到这些这个洗钱的一个渠道是跟中国一些高层有关，他而且他给拍出来了，这样就肯定会得罪了很多的人。但不管怎么说，奈飞的东西还是值得看的，无论你上不上奈飞的平台都可以看到。奈飞平台上其实挺麻烦的，这一方面可能要翻墙，另一方面账号还不好弄。现在尽管淘宝已经也有一些账号在卖，而且价格很便宜，但是各种东西毕竟太麻烦了。所以国内幸亏我们有很多很多的这种其他网站可以看到这些剧。
- 总之通过看这个叫我很在乎通过我很在乎这部电影，大家也看到了这个奈飞的一种制作的模式，就是他在拍这个电影的时候，他估计就已经预料到了这个市场对他的反响，他也没要求所有的人都喜欢这部电影，它是在所有的类型的夹缝中，找出了这个类型，然后就利用大女主的力量，利用裴春华这个人，利用他的魅力，就由她生硬生生就带着这部电影在往前走。这也是他现在制作的一个主要方式，就是利用一个非常好的主角，然后把这个电影给撑起来。
- 就比如说这个我们再回到无一之地，无一之地的无一之地是另外一个平台叫葫芦做的，就是它它不是那个不是奈飞的，但它的制作模式是类似的，就是他也是先买断了这个版权，买断了这个小说的版不是小说是一个纪实作品的版权是这个就是 francis macmo mound 就是这个柯恩嫂他买了这个版权，然后他又找到了赵婷把它改编成了电视剧，改编成了电影剧本。然后把它拍出来。但是这个电影你一看又代表了另一另外一种风格，风格上的探索，它拍的就特别诗意，特别美。
- 有同样是电影，如果是你要花两个小时看一部电影的时候，我们就要有这样一个概念，就是无论你看剧看电影，我们并不是免费的。尽管我们可能不用去电影院就能下载到，但是你投入了时间，这也是一个很重要的投入同志们假如我们投入了两个小时的时间，既得不到娱乐还很郁闷。当然因为大家在学习编剧，这还好，就不管好电影烂片，我们都可以从中学到点什么，这是我们意外的时候。但是假如你是纯粹的观众的话，其实是很郁闷的，就是看两个小时并没有解决你任何问题，而且很郁闷。
- 这个时候你就就要盘就要就要这个权衡一下哪部电影是值得看的这个各种电影奖，就其实是帮助我们能够选择一些好的电影，就是你看光为这个镜头，我觉得就很值得去投入时间，尤其到电影院这种封闭的空间里去看它，那个感觉会更好。不过经过这个春节档，估计是以后的电影票都要涨价了，就是降不下来了。这个东西有一个惯性涨到 40 多块，现在得城里的五十多，五十的六七十的也有，甚至卖过上百，就是以后可能价格不会太降下来。但是这个还是值得去电影院去看的，因为它这个的音效他的这个摄影都做得特别棒。这种如果是在电脑上小屏幕上看，有点糟蹋。但是对这个电影你就不要有任何故事方面的期待，它基本上故事是很弱的。
- 他是一个把群相式的人物放在了一个女人身上，都放在他虚构了一个人物，就是这个柯恩嫂演的一个退休的老太太，然后他开着车四处游荡。但是其实他身上综合了上百个人物，就是这里边有很多的这种流浪者，就是他们自己本人演的。这里边流浪者也很多，就是大家都到了这个就在美国很有意思。就是当当大家城里日子过不下去的时候，它还有一片地可以这个让大家去流浪，而且在一起唱歌跳舞还看上去挺快活。
- 当然仅仅是这个短暂的，但这些人他自己就不承认自己是那个无家可归者，他说我是无可归者，他说我不是 homeless 我是 how slice 就他们还有一点这个有点觉得，因为这些人都是中产阶级，以前都是中产阶级，只是因为各种的生活的变故，使他们把他们投入到了这个流浪的大军中。
- 就是这批人其实新时代的这种吉普赛人在美国还是代表了一种社会现象。所以很有可能这部电影纪念烟呼奥斯卡，因为它代表了这个时代，是又反映了美国这么一群人的故事。然后另外一个就是现在这个时代，它里边还多次提到这个纪念那些死去的人，就是他们有一个流浪的老太太就死掉了。然后这些人一般都是丧失了亲人之后才上路的，所以这个很适合纪念一下。美国已经死了 6 将近 60 万人，50多万人，将近 60 万人的这样一个国家。再加上赵婷是，亚裔他有政治上正确的一面，就是给了他谁也不会有意见，白人不会羡慕黑人也不会，如果纯给白人，黑人又不高兴了所以这个电影我们还是值得看一下，今天时候不倒了，我们就到这，谢谢大家。
- 我觉得这个是，就是我觉得这个就今晚上放的。
